This would imply that the Ephraimitas should be the first to go into exile, and on their return should occupy the territory of the Canaanites on the north. But <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> may mean "domain." Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et transmigratio exercitus hujus filiorum Israel, omnia loca Chananaeorum usque ad Sareptam.</span> The general meaning is that Jewish captives, who have been taken to other lands, shall return and possess the cities of the south. The sentence in the Hebrew is incomplete. Our translators supply, "shall possess." Pusey (in agreement with the Chaldee, and virtually with the Septuagint) renders, "which are among the Canaanites;" and this seems to be correct, making "shall possess the cities of the south" the predicate of both clauses. So the first portion of the verse means, as Henderson says, the number of Israelitish captives which were found in Phoenicia, into which they had been sold at different times as slaves (comp. vers. 11, 14; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-6.htm">Joel 3:6, 7</a>). <span class="accented">This host.</span> Not a general deportation, but only the portion of the people referred to. From this expression some have inferred that Obadiah himself was one of this body. This is possible, but not necessary. The captives who are among the Canaanites, even <span class="accented">unto Zarephath</span>; <span class="accented">as far as Zarephath</span>, were probably placed there for safe keeping before being sold into Greece and other countries. Zarepbath ("Melting house"), the <span class="accented">Sarepta</span> of St. Luke (Luke 4:26), now <span class="accented">Surafend</span> or <span class="accented">Sarafend</span>, and celebrated in the history of Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-9.htm">1 Kings 17:9</a>, etc.), lay between Tyre and Sidon, a little inland, and was a town of some importance, as its ruins prove. The captivity of Jerusalem. The captives from Jerusalem. Which is in Sepharad; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f18;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;</span> "as far as Ephrathah;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">quae in Bosphoro est.</span> The name occurs nowhere else in the Bible, and its identification cannot be established. Jerome suggests, in his commentary, that it is the Assyrian for "boundary," and not a proper name at all. The Peshito and the rabbins And modern Jews interpret it as "Spain." Keil supposes it to be "Sparta;" Pusey, "Sardis." For this last explanation some ground has been found in an inscription of Nakshi-Rustam, where a place called <span class="accented">Cparda</span> occurs in a list of tribes between Cappadocia and Ionia; and <span class="accented">Cparda is</span> considered to be the Persian form of <span class="accented">Sardis</span> (see Schrader, 'Keilinschr.,' p. 445, etc.). A further confirmation of this identification is found in the complaint of Joel (Joel 3:6 [4:6, Hebrew], that the Phoenicians had sold Israelites "unto the sons of the Grecians." Professor Sayce, in a note to G. Smith's 'History of Babylonia,' p. 156, places "Saparda" on the Black Sea. It may be questioned, however, whether some town nearer Judaea is not intended. Ewald would read "Sepharam," a town in North Palestine. The two bodies of captives <span class="cmt_word">shall possess the cities of the south.</span> The Negeb. The cities are named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19.htm">Joshua 19</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/obadiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:17-21 There should be deliverance and holiness at Jerusalem, and the house of Jacob would again occupy their possessions. Much of this prophecy was fulfilled when the Jews returned to their own land. But the salvation and holiness of the gospel, its spread, and the conversion of the Gentiles, seem also to be intended, especially the restoration of Israel, the destruction of antichrist, and the prosperous state of the church, to which all the prophets bear witness. When Christ is come, and not till then, shall the kingdom be the Lord's in the full sense of the term. As none that exalt themselves against the Lord shall prosper, and all shall be brought down; so none that wait upon the Lord, and put their trust in him, shall ever be dismayed. Blessed be the Divine Saviour and Judge on Mount Zion! His word shall be a savour of life unto life unto numbers, while it judges and condemns obstinate unbelievers.</body></html>
