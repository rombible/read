"I need not tell you about the time, for you know to a nicety--not the hour of Christ's coming, but--the utter uncertainty respecting it." The word shows at the same time with what scrupulous care St. Paul had instructed them on this topic.<p><span class= "bld">The day of the Lord.</span>--Here "the Lord" (as usual in the New Testament) means Jesus Christ; and this day can mean nothing else than the great day of His return to judgment. The expression is taken from the Old Testament, where, of course, it does not primarily mean what we call "the Day of Judgment," but the set time which God has fixed for any great visitation. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-1.htm" title="Blow you the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the LORD comes, for it is near at hand;">Joel 2:1</a>, <span class= "ital">et seq., </span>it means the time appointed for the plague of locusts; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-5.htm" title="You have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.">Ezekiel 13:5</a>, generally, any day when God visits His people; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-14.htm" title="Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.">Joel 3:14</a>, the fixed time for vengeance to be taken upon the heathen for persecuting the Church; which, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-12.htm" title="For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be on every one that is proud and lofty, and on every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low:">Isaiah 2:12</a> (a passage largely influenced by recollections of Joel), seems to widen into a general day of judgment for mankind.<p><span class= "bld">Cometh.</span>--Not merely, <span class= "ital">will come; </span>it is an absolute certainty that the time is on its way to come. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm" title="And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.">1Thessalonians 1:10</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">As a thief in the night</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span> unexpectedly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-43.htm" title="But know this, that if the manager of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.">Matthew 24:43</a>), and under cover of darkness. The frequency of the simile (see references) throws light on the words "know perfectly," making it apparent that it was the ordinary formula in which the doctrine was universally taught by the Apostles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For yourselves know perfectly</span>; namely, not from Scripture, nor from oral tradition, but from the teaching of the apostle when in Thessalonica. <span class="cmt_word">That the day of the Lord</span>. "The day of the Lord" is a common Old Testament expression, denoting the coming of the Divine judgments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1</a>); and by the phrase here is meant, not the destruction of Jerusalem, nor the day of one's death, but the day of the Lord's advent, when Christ shall descend from heaven in glory for the resurrection of the dead and the judgment of the world. The idea of judgment is contained in the term "day." <span class="cmt_word">So cometh as a thief in the night</span>. The same comparison is used by our Lord himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-43.htm">Matthew 24:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-39.htm">Luke 12:39</a>), and the very words are employed by Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>). The point of resemblance is evidently the unexpectedness and suddenness of the coming. The thief comes upon people in the night season, when they are asleep and unprepared; so, in a similar manner, when Christ comes, he will find the world unprepared and not expecting his advent. The ancient Fathers inferred from this passage that Christ would come to judgment in the night season, and hence they instituted vigils, or night watches. Some, still more precisely, fixed the coming on Easter night, from the analogy of the deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt on the paschal evening. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-5 It is needless or useless to ask about the particular time of Christ's coming. Christ did not reveal this to the apostles. There are times and seasons for us to work in, and these are our duty and interest to know and observe; but as to the time when we must give up our account, we know it not, nor is it needful that we should. The coming of Christ will be a great surprise to men. Our Lord himself said so. As the hour of death is the same to each person that the judgment will be to mankind in general, so the same remarks answer for both. Christ's coming will be terrible to the ungodly. Their destruction will overtake them while they dream of happiness, and please themselves with vain amusements. There will be no means to escape the terror or the punishment of that day. This day will be a happy day to the righteous. They are not in darkness; they are the children of the light. It is the happy condition of all true Christians. But how many are speaking peace and safety to themselves, over whose heads utter destruction is hovering! Let us endeavour to awaken ourselves and each other, and guard against our spiritual enemies.</body></html>
