If so, the "holy kiss" had hardly become the fixed Church ceremony which it afterwards was, for the practice (according to the <span class= "ital">Apostolicqal Constitutions</span>) was for the Church members to pass the kiss from one to another, men kissing men, and women kissing women, not for all the people to be kissed in turn by the priest. This kiss, however, is no doubt intended by St. Paul to be given at a solemn assembly of the Church, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>at the Holy Communion, which was the only fixed meeting of the Primitive Church. In the time of St. Cyril of Jerusalem, the kiss was given just before the <span class= "ital">Sursum Corda.</span> It was not till the thirteenth century that the kissing of the <span class= "ital">Pax</span> was substituted in the Western Church for the kissing of the brethren. This kiss was to differ from the ordinary Greek <span class= "ital">salutation, </span>by being distinctly a <span class= "ital">holy</span> kiss, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>a ceremonial, religious kiss.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.</span> That certain persons were enjoined to salute the other members of the Church is a proof that the Epistle was given into the hands of the presbyters. The reference is to the mode of salutation in the East. The kiss is called "holy" because it was the symbol of Christian affection. The same exhortation is made in other Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-16.htm">Romans 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-20.htm">1 Corinthians 16:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-12.htm">2 Corinthians 13:12</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:23-28 The apostle prays that they might be sanctified more perfectly, for the best are sanctified but in part while in this world; therefore we should pray for, and press toward, complete holiness. And as we must fall, if God did not carry on his good work in the soul, we should pray to God to perfect his work, till we are presented faultless before the throne of his glory. We should pray for one another; and brethren should thus express brotherly love. This epistle was to be read to all the brethren. Not only are the common people allowed to read the Scriptures, but it is their duty, and what they should be persuaded to do. The word of God should not be kept in an unknown tongue, but transplanted, that as all men are concerned to know the Scriptures, so they all may be able to read them. The Scriptures should be read in all public congregations, for the benefit of the unlearned especially. We need no more to make us happy, than to know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. He is an ever-flowing and an over-flowing fountain of grace to supply all our wants.</body></html>
