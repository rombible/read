The gloom and depression to which an antidote is administered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/5-16.htm" title="Rejoice ever more.">1Thessalonians 5:16-18</a> had been such as almost to extinguish that fire of enthusiasm which ought to have burst out in prayers, praises, thanksgivings, and "prophecies." The "Spirit" here must not be taken too sharply to mean the Person of the Holy Ghost: the Person of the Holy Ghost maybe grieved (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-30.htm" title="And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed to the day of redemption.">Ephesians 4:30</a>), expelled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-11.htm" title="Cast me not away from your presence; and take not your holy spirit from me.">Psalm 51:11</a>), neglected (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-14.htm" title="Neglect not the gift that is in you, which was given you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.">1Timothy 4:14</a>), but (though His working on the individual may be stopped) <span class= "ital">He</span> can never be extinguished. The word here again (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm" title="For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.">1Thessalonians 1:5</a>) is in that intermediate sense which expresses the <span class= "ital">effect</span> of the Holy Ghost's personal working upon our spirits. He kindles in us a fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm" title="I indeed baptize you with water to repentance. but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.">Matthew 3:11</a>), that is, a consuming ardour and enthusiasm, of love to God and man; which ardour may be damped, quenched, by not giving it free air and play. Gloom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-16.htm" title="Rejoice ever more.">1Thessalonians 5:16</a>), neglect of prayer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm" title="Pray without ceasing.">1Thessalonians 5:17</a>) which is the very feeding of the flame, discontentment with the answer which God chooses to give to prayer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm" title="In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.">1Thessalonians 5:18</a>), will in the end reduce us to the condition in which we were before we were confirmed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-9.htm" title="But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.">Romans 8:9</a>). Comp. <span class= "ital">Ecce Homo, </span>p. 257 (3rd ed.):--"The Apostles in like manner became sensible that their inspiration was liable to intermissions. They regard it as possible to grieve the Divinity who resided within them, and ever. to quench His influence. But neither they nor Christ even for a moment suppose that, if He should take His flight, it is possible to do without Him . . . Christianity is an enthusiasm, or it is nothing."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - Quench not the Spirit. The Spirit is here considered as a flame which may be extinguished (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a>). The descent of the Spirit at Pentecost was in the form of cloven tongues like as of fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-3.htm">Acts 2:3</a>). By the Spirit here is usually understood the miraculous gifts of the Spirit - speaking with tongues or prophesyings; and it is supposed that the apostle here forbids the exercise of these gifts being hindered or checked. In the next verse the gift of prophesying is mentioned. But there is no reason to exclude the ordinary and still more valuable gifts of the Spirit, such as pure thoughts, holy actions, devout affections, which may be effectually quenched by a careless or immoral life. "Quench not the Spirit." Do not those things which are opposed to his influences. Be on your guard against sin, as opposed to the work of the Spirit in the soul. In this sense the admonition is similar to that given by Paul in his Epistle to the Ephesians: "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:16-22 We are to rejoice in creature-comforts, as if we rejoiced not, and must not expect to live many years, and rejoice in them all; but if we do rejoice in God, we may do that evermore. A truly religious life is a life of constant joy. And we should rejoice more, if we prayed more. Prayer will help forward all lawful business, and every good work. If we pray without ceasing, we shall not want matter for thanksgiving in every thing. We shall see cause to give thanks for sparing and preventing, for common and uncommon, past and present, temporal and spiritual mercies. Not only for prosperous and pleasing, but also for afflicting providences, for chastisements and corrections; for God designs all for our good, though we at present see not how they tend to it. Quench not the Spirit. Christians are said to be baptized with the Holy Ghost and with fire. He worketh as fire, by enlightening, enlivening, and purifying the souls of men. As fire is put out by taking away fuel, and as it is quenched by pouring water, or putting a great deal of earth upon it; so we must be careful not to quench the Holy Spirit, by indulging carnal lusts and affections, minding only earthly things. Believers often hinder their growth in grace, by not giving themselves up to the spiritual affections raised in their hearts by the Holy Spirit. By prophesyings, here understand the preaching of the word, the interpreting and applying the Scriptures. We must not despise preaching, though it is plain, and we are told no more than what we knew before. We must search the Scriptures. And proving all things must be to hold fast that which is good. We should abstain from sin, and whatever looks like sin, leads to it, and borders upon it. He who is not shy of the appearances of sin, who shuns not the occasions of it, and who avoids not the temptations and approaches to it, will not long keep from doing sin.</body></html>
