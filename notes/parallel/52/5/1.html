"Times and seasons" is a Hebraism, and in the original, the <span class= "ital">second</span> word, not the first, is the more explicit: we should say, "About day and hour." The plural seems to mean the different periods at which men might conceive the Advent likely to come.<p><span class= "bld">Ye have no need.</span>--The next verse shows that this paragraph is not so much intended for an answer to a false theory about the time of the Advent, as practically to cure the restlessness common at Thessalonica.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - This verse is connected with what precedes. The apostle was comforting the Thessalonians under the loss of their deceased friends by the assurance that both the living and the dead would be gathered together at the advent. The question would naturally arise, "When shall these things be?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-7.htm">Luke 21:7</a>); and it would appear that the Thessalonians expected an immediate advent. The apostle represses their curiosity on this point by reminding them of the uncertainty of the time of the Lord's coming. <span class="cmt_word">But of the times and the seasons, brethren</span>; that is, of the time and the precise period of the Lord's advent. "Times" and "seasons" are elsewhere united together (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>). The word translated "times" denotes time absolutely without regard to circumstances; and the word rendered "seasons" denotes a definite point of time; not merely the day, but the hour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-32.htm">Mark 13:32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye have no need that I write unto you</span>; literally, <span class="accented">that ought be written unto you</span> (R.V.); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:9</a>. The reason why it was not needful for the apostle to write unto them was, not because he regarded the information unprofitable or superfluous, or because he knew it to be impossible, but because he had already informed them when at Thessalonica that the time of the advent was beyond the sphere of his teaching. The apostle mentions this to repress that vain curiosity which is natural to man, and which was the occasion of so much disorder among the Thessalonians. Our duty is, not to pry into the times and seasons which the Father hath put in his own power (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>), but to exercise constant watchfulness. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-5 It is needless or useless to ask about the particular time of Christ's coming. Christ did not reveal this to the apostles. There are times and seasons for us to work in, and these are our duty and interest to know and observe; but as to the time when we must give up our account, we know it not, nor is it needful that we should. The coming of Christ will be a great surprise to men. Our Lord himself said so. As the hour of death is the same to each person that the judgment will be to mankind in general, so the same remarks answer for both. Christ's coming will be terrible to the ungodly. Their destruction will overtake them while they dream of happiness, and please themselves with vain amusements. There will be no means to escape the terror or the punishment of that day. This day will be a happy day to the righteous. They are not in darkness; they are the children of the light. It is the happy condition of all true Christians. But how many are speaking peace and safety to themselves, over whose heads utter destruction is hovering! Let us endeavour to awaken ourselves and each other, and guard against our spiritual enemies.</body></html>
