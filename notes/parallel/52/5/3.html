Of course, however, no <span class= "ital">Christian</span> could say so, for they are ever on the watch, so that "they" will mean "the world." The word "for" at the beginning of the verse should (according to the best MSS.) be struck out--the abruptness helps to enforce the lesson.<p><span class= "bld">Peace and safety.</span>--Carrying on the thought suggested by the word "night; they are taking their repose in security, without dreaming of any interruption to their slumbers. Is it possible that there may here be a faint recollection of the parable related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/25-1.htm" title="Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.">Matthew 25:1-13</a>?<p><span class= "bld">Destruction cometh upon them.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">stands over them;</span> or <span class= "ital">takes its stand over them; presents itself.</span> The present tense is used for the sake of a more vivid effect. The extreme similarity of this passage to <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-34.htm" title="And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come on you unawares.">Luke 21:34</a> (with other indications) inclines Bishop Wordsworth to think that the Thessalonians had the Gospel of St. Luke to refer to.<p><span class= "bld">As travail.</span>--A common Oriental simile to express not only suddenness, but horror also. Theodoret fairly says, "The woman with child knows that she has the child to bear, but knows not the exact time for her pangs; so we also know that the Lord of all will appear, but the moment itself we have by no means been explicitly taught." The comment, however, hardly suits this passage, as the persons on whom the destruction will thus burst are not persons who live in <span class= "ital">any</span> expectation of such a judgment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - For; the best manuscripts omit this conjunction; the description is continuous. <span class="cmt_word">When they shall say</span>; namely, the unbelieving world. <span class="cmt_word">Peace and safety</span>; peace denoting internal rest, and safety external security. <span class="cmt_word">Sudden destruction cometh upon them.</span> When they thought themselves most secure, they were then in the greatest danger; when they were most off their guard, then the crisis came. <span class="cmt_word">As travail upon a woman with child.</span> The primary point of resemblance is certainly the suddenness and unexpectedness of the event; as labor comes upon a woman suddenly, so sudden destruction cometh upon the ungodly world. Still, however, the unavoidableness of the judgment may also be here intimated; there is no possibility of escape: this is implied in the last clause, <span class="cmt_word">and they shall not escape.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-5 It is needless or useless to ask about the particular time of Christ's coming. Christ did not reveal this to the apostles. There are times and seasons for us to work in, and these are our duty and interest to know and observe; but as to the time when we must give up our account, we know it not, nor is it needful that we should. The coming of Christ will be a great surprise to men. Our Lord himself said so. As the hour of death is the same to each person that the judgment will be to mankind in general, so the same remarks answer for both. Christ's coming will be terrible to the ungodly. Their destruction will overtake them while they dream of happiness, and please themselves with vain amusements. There will be no means to escape the terror or the punishment of that day. This day will be a happy day to the righteous. They are not in darkness; they are the children of the light. It is the happy condition of all true Christians. But how many are speaking peace and safety to themselves, over whose heads utter destruction is hovering! Let us endeavour to awaken ourselves and each other, and guard against our spiritual enemies.</body></html>
