What a blessed privilege a Christian's life of labour must be, if it alone--to say nothing of the "salvation" at the end--cost such a price!<p><span class= "bld">Whether we wake or sleep.</span>--The mention of Christ's death at once brings back the recollection of the Advent and the questions concerning the dead in their relation to it. The words "wake or sleep" seem distinctly suggested by the metaphor used <span class= "ital">from </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm" title="For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.">1Thessalonians 5:2</a> <span class= "ital">to </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm" title="But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.">1Thessalonians 5:8</a>, being different in the Greek from the terms used in 1 Thessalonians 4, but abruptly take a much altered meaning. They here, no doubt, signify "life and death:"--"Let us arm ourselves with a brave hope of our salvation, for it will be against God's will if we should perish: He means us to save ourselves by union with Him who put an end to death for us by dying, and made all who wait for His coming to <span class= "ital">live, </span>whether they be in the world's sense dead or alive."<p><span class= "bld">We should live.</span>--In sharp contrast with "who died for us." Christ's dying destroyed the power of death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm" title="For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;">Hebrews 2:14</a>); henceforth it is only a matter of being awake or asleep; those who sleep quite as truly live, and live with Him, as we who wake (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-38.htm" title="For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live to him.">Luke 20:38</a>; and compare the more developed passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-8.htm" title="For whether we live, we live to the Lord; and whether we die, we die to the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.">Romans 14:8</a>). The word "together" (as the Greek clearly shows) must be separated from the "with;" rather, "we should live with Him together," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>we quick, and our brethren the dead; for St. Paul has entirely reverted from the <span class= "ital">effect</span> of the Advent-doctrine upon Christian life to the subject of the last chapter--the equality of the two classes at Christ's coming. Bengel, thinking that St. Paul is still applying himself to the discussion of the <span class= "ital">date</span> of the Advent (which in fact was scarcely raised), tries to make out the meaning, "That we should <span class= "ital">there and then</span> live with Him."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who died</span>. His death being the meritorious cause of our salvation. <span class="cmt_word">For us</span>; that is here, not "instead of us," but "for our benefit," or "on our account." <span class="cmt_word">That, whether we wake or sleep.</span> Here not to be taken in an ethical sense - whether we are spiritually awake or asleep, for those who are spiritually asleep will be surprised by the coming of the Lord; nor in a natural sense - whether he come in the night and find us taking our natural sleep, or in the day, when we are awake - which would be a mere trifling observation; but in a metaphorical sense - whether we are alive or dead. The apostle has just been speaking of those who are dead under the designation of those "who are asleep" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>), and therefore it is natural to interpret the clause, "whether we wake or sleep," of the condition of believers at the coming of the Lord. There is here certainly a change of metaphor: "sleep" in ver. 6 denotes religious carelessness; in ver. 7, natural sleep; and here, death. <span class="cmt_word">We shall live together</span> - or, in <span class="accented">one company - <span class="cmt_word"></span>with him.</span> The apostle is still continuing his consolatory address to those who were mourning over their deceased friends; and he tells them that at the advent there will be no difference between those who are then alive and those who sleep - both will live together with the Lord (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-8.htm">Romans 14:8, 9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:6-11 Most of mankind do not consider the things of another world at all, because they are asleep; or they do not consider them aright, because they sleep and dream. Our moderation as to all earthly things should be known to all men. Shall Christians, who have the light of the blessed gospel shining in their faces, be careless about their souls, and unmindful of another world? We need the spiritual armour, or the three Christian graces, faith, love, and hope. Faith; if we believe that the eye of God is always upon us, that there is another world to prepare for, we shall see reason to watch and be sober. True and fervent love to God, and the things of God, will keep us watchful and sober. If we have hope of salvation, let us take heed of any thing that would shake our trust in the Lord. We have ground on which to build unshaken hope, when we consider, that salvation is by our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, to atone for our sins and to ransom our souls. We should join in prayer and praise one with another. We should set a good example one before another, and this is the best means to answer the end of society. Thus we shall learn how to live to Him, with whom we hope to live for ever.</body></html>
