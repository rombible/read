St. Paul is here catching up once more the thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-18.htm" title="Why comfort one another with these words.">1Thessalonians 4:18</a>. They are to comfort one another about their communion with the dead who live in Christ; but perhaps the word also involves the comfort to be imparted by the thought of predestination to earn salvation. The command to "Edify one another" certainly refers to the instruction given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/5-1.htm" title="But of the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that I write to you.">1Thessalonians 5:1-10</a> :" Build one another up "in these settled purposes of holy living. This metaphor of building is one which St. Paul uses frequently in his later writings, and which St. Peter (who uses the same) may have adopted from his brother Apostle. St. Paul considers not only the whole Catholic Church to be a great Temple of the Spirit, the stones of which are individual souls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1Peter 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?">1Corinthians 3:16</a>), but each believer is a temple too, complete in himself, or, rather, in continual process of completion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-19.htm" title="What? know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own?">1Corinthians 6:19</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore</span>; because, whether alive or dead, you will equally share in the blessings of the advent. <span class="cmt_word">Comfort yourselves together.</span> The words refer back to the last verse of the preceding chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:18</a>), and with them the apostle concludes his consolatory address to those who were mourning over the loss of their friends. <span class="cmt_word">And edify one another;</span> or, <span class="accented">build up.</span> It was a favorite figure of the apostle to compare the Christian Church and each individual believer to a building. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:6-11 Most of mankind do not consider the things of another world at all, because they are asleep; or they do not consider them aright, because they sleep and dream. Our moderation as to all earthly things should be known to all men. Shall Christians, who have the light of the blessed gospel shining in their faces, be careless about their souls, and unmindful of another world? We need the spiritual armour, or the three Christian graces, faith, love, and hope. Faith; if we believe that the eye of God is always upon us, that there is another world to prepare for, we shall see reason to watch and be sober. True and fervent love to God, and the things of God, will keep us watchful and sober. If we have hope of salvation, let us take heed of any thing that would shake our trust in the Lord. We have ground on which to build unshaken hope, when we consider, that salvation is by our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, to atone for our sins and to ransom our souls. We should join in prayer and praise one with another. We should set a good example one before another, and this is the best means to answer the end of society. Thus we shall learn how to live to Him, with whom we hope to live for ever.</body></html>
