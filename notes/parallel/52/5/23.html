This sanctification (which is the special work of the Third Person) is here ascribed to the First Person of the Holy Trinity, from whom the Holy Ghost proceeds. He is called (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-20.htm" title="Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,">Hebrews 13:20</a>) the "God of peace," not in reference to any dissensions between the Thessalonians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-13.htm" title="And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves.">1Thessalonians 5:13</a>), but because of the peace which His sanctification brings into the soul, so that it fears neither temptation's power nor persecution's rage. (Comp. the Second Collect for Evensong).<p><span class= "bld">Sanctify you wholly.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">sanctify you whole.</span> The idea is rather that of leaving no part unsanctified, than that of doing the work completely so far as it goes: thus it serves to introduce the next sentence, which explains it.<p><span class= "bld">And I pray God.</span>--If there were need of any insertion, it should have been "<span class= "ital">We</span> pray God:" Silas and Timothy are never forgotten throughout.<p><span class= "bld">Spirit and soul and body.</span>--This is St. Paul's fullest and most scientific psychology, not merely a rhetorical piling up of words without any particular meaning being assigned to them. Elsewhere, he merely divides man according to popular language, into two parts, visible and invisible, "body and spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm" title="For you are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.">1Corinthians 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-34.htm" title="There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.">1Corinthians 7:34</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>); the division into "body and <span class= "ital">soul</span>" he never uses. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-14.htm" title="But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.">1Corinthians 2:14</a>.) The "spirit" (<span class= "ital">pneuma</span>) is the part by which we apprehend realities <span class= "ital">intuitively</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, without reasoning upon them; with it we touch, see, serve, worship God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/4-23.htm" title="But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeks such to worship him.">John 4:23-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-9.htm" title="For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;">Romans 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-17.htm" title="But he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.">1Corinthians 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-10.htm" title="I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,">Revelation 1:10</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span> it is the very inmost consciousness of the man (see, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-11.htm" title="For what man knows the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knows no man, but the Spirit of God.">1Corinthians 2:11</a>); it is the part of him which survives death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-23.htm" title="To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,">Hebrews 12:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-19.htm" title="By which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;">1Peter 3:19</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-46.htm" title="And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.">Luke 23:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-59.htm" title="And they stoned Stephen, calling on God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.">Acts 7:59</a>). The "soul." (<span class= "ital">psyche</span>) includes the intellect, the affections, and the will: and it is of the very essence of the gospel to force sharply upon men the distinction between it and the <span class= "ital">spirit</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-12.htm" title="For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.">Hebrews 4:12</a>). Low-living men may have <span class= "ital">soul </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>intellect, affection, will) in abundance, but their <span class= "ital">spirit</span> falls into complete abeyance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-19.htm" title="These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.">Jude 1:19</a>); the <span class= "ital">soul</span> belongs altogether to the lower nature, so that when St. Paul uses the two-fold division, "body and spirit," the <span class= "ital">soul</span> is reckoned (not, probably, as Bishop Ellicott says on our present passage, as part of the <span class= "ital">spirit, </span>but) as part of the <span class= "ital">body; </span>and when St. Paul describes the "works of the flesh," he includes among them such distinctly <span class= "ital">soul-sins</span> as "heresies" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-20.htm" title="Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, jealousies, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,">Galatians 5:20</a>). Sanctification preserves all these three divisions <span class= "ital">entire, </span>and in their due <span class= "ital">relation</span> to each other; without sanctification, the <span class= "ital">spirit</span> might be overwhelmed by the other parts gaining the predominance, which would, of course, eventually be the ruin both of "soul and body in hell" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-28.htm" title="And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.">Matthew 10:28</a>. N.B., that our Lord says nothing of the destruction of the "spirit" in hell: the question is whether He there definitely meant to <span class= "ital">exclude "</span>spirit," or used <span class= "ital">"</span>soul" popularly as including it). Where the New Testament writers <span class= "ital">acquired</span> such a psychology cannot be determined, but it was probably derived from experimental knowledge of life, not from books, and all experience confirms its accuracy. Modern science tends more and more to show that "<span class= "ital">soul"</span> is a function of "<span class= "ital">body."</span><p><span class= "bld">Unto the coming.</span>--A mistranslation for <span class= "ital">"at</span> the coming," caused by the slight difficulty in understanding the true version. The idea is not so much that of their preservation from sin during the <span class= "ital">interval, </span>but rather the writers hasten in eager anticipation to the Coming itself, and hope that the Thessalonians <span class= "ital">at</span> the Coming will be <span class= "ital">found to have been preserved.</span> "Blameless" should have been "blamelessly."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the very God of peace</span>; the God who communicates peace; an expression frequently employed by Paul at the close of his Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-33.htm">Romans 15:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-20.htm">Romans 16:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-9.htm">Philippians 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-16.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Sanctify you wholly</span>; that is, perfectly, without anything wanting, referring to the entireness of the sanctification, which is presently expressed in detail. <span class="cmt_word">And I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body</span>; the adjective "whole" applies to all the three substantives. The apostle here divides human nature into three parts - spirit, soul, and body; and this threefold division is not a mere rhetorical statement: "The apostle pouring forth from the fullness of his heart a prayer for his converts" (Jowett); but a distinct statement of the three component parts of human nature. The "spirit" is the highest part of man, that which assimilates him to God; renders him capable of religion, and susceptible of being acted upon by the Spirit of God. The "soul" is the inferior part of his mental nature, the seat of the passions and desires, of the natural propensities. The "body" is the corporeal frame. Such a threefold distinction of human nature was not unknown among the Stoics and Platonists. There are also traces of it in the Old Testament, the spirit, or breath of God, being distinguished from the soul. <span class="cmt_word">Be preserved blameless</span>. "The spirit is preserved blameless at the advent when the voice of truth rules it, the soul when it strives against all the charms of the senses, and the body when it is not abused as the instrument of shameful actions" (Lunemann). Unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:23-28 The apostle prays that they might be sanctified more perfectly, for the best are sanctified but in part while in this world; therefore we should pray for, and press toward, complete holiness. And as we must fall, if God did not carry on his good work in the soul, we should pray to God to perfect his work, till we are presented faultless before the throne of his glory. We should pray for one another; and brethren should thus express brotherly love. This epistle was to be read to all the brethren. Not only are the common people allowed to read the Scriptures, but it is their duty, and what they should be persuaded to do. The word of God should not be kept in an unknown tongue, but transplanted, that as all men are concerned to know the Scriptures, so they all may be able to read them. The Scriptures should be read in all public congregations, for the benefit of the unlearned especially. We need no more to make us happy, than to know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. He is an ever-flowing and an over-flowing fountain of grace to supply all our wants.</body></html>
