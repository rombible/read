The following exhortation shows that it was a matter of each man's free will whether he would sustain his character as a "child of light" or not.<p><span class= "bld">Children of light.</span>--The expression is an enthusiastic Hebrew poetical turn for intimate vital connection with anything; thus, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>"children of this world" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-8.htm" title="And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.">Luke 16:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-34.htm" title="And Jesus answering said to them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:">Luke 20:34</a>) = "mere products of this age," with a family likeness for other worldly people; "the son of peace" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-6.htm" title="And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest on it: if not, it shall turn to you again.">Luke 10:6</a>)=a person with whom peace has a natural affinity, to whom the "peace" pronounced will cleave naturally. So "children of the light" are persons to whom darkness is an alien thing, whose natures have a kinship, an intuitive responsiveness for whatever may be called "light." To such persons the "light," the "day," can never come as an unwelcome, startling apparition.<p><span class= "bld">We.</span>--Notice St. Paul's courtesy again: he suddenly includes himself in his exhortation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye are all the children of the light, and the children of the day.</span> Hebraistic expressions denoting, Ye all belong to the light and to the day. An affirmation, strengthening the previous declaration. The light and the day are synonymous expressions - the day being the period of light, as opposed to the night and darkness. <span class="cmt_word">We are not of the night, nor of darkness</span>; rendering the positive assertion more emphatic. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-5 It is needless or useless to ask about the particular time of Christ's coming. Christ did not reveal this to the apostles. There are times and seasons for us to work in, and these are our duty and interest to know and observe; but as to the time when we must give up our account, we know it not, nor is it needful that we should. The coming of Christ will be a great surprise to men. Our Lord himself said so. As the hour of death is the same to each person that the judgment will be to mankind in general, so the same remarks answer for both. Christ's coming will be terrible to the ungodly. Their destruction will overtake them while they dream of happiness, and please themselves with vain amusements. There will be no means to escape the terror or the punishment of that day. This day will be a happy day to the righteous. They are not in darkness; they are the children of the light. It is the happy condition of all true Christians. But how many are speaking peace and safety to themselves, over whose heads utter destruction is hovering! Let us endeavour to awaken ourselves and each other, and guard against our spiritual enemies.</body></html>
