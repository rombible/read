The logical connection of this verse with the preceding is that of course the main endeavours to "edify" the brethren were made by the presbytery; and the command to edify involves the command to accept edification.<p><span class= "bld">Are over you in the Lord.</span>--This is the primitive idea of the priest in the Church: he is not a member of a sacerdotal caste, ministering to an outer world, but a <span class= "ital">superior officer</span> in a spiritual society consisting of nothing but priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-6.htm" title="And has made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.">Revelation 1:6</a>, where the right reading is, "Made us a kingdom of priests"). It is specially interesting to notice how much <span class= "ital">power</span> is given to the presbytery in this earliest writing of the New Testament, and how carefully St. Paul seems to have organised his churches, and that at the very foundation of them. It is only "in the Lord" that the presbytery are over men, that is, in spiritual matters.<p><span class= "bld">Admonish you.</span>--The presbytery are not only organisers, managers of the corporate affairs of their Church, but also spiritual guides to give practical advice to individual Christians. These are the two senses in which they are "over you."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - With this verse commences a new paragraph. The apostle adds in conclusion a few brief and somewhat miscellaneous exhortations. <span class="cmt_word">And we beseech you, brethren</span>; an expression of earnestness and affection. <span class="cmt_word">To know</span>; that is, to value, appreciate, and esteem. <span class="cmt_word">Them which labor among you.</span> It was Paul's custom to organize the Churches which he had founded, and to appoint presbyters among them. Although the Church of Thessalonica had been so recently founded, yet it had its presbyters. <span class="cmt_word">And are over you.</span> The presbyters, in virtue of their office, presided over the Christian assemblies. In the Lord; the sphere in which they were set over the Church; they were ordained to minister in sacred things. <span class="cmt_word">And admonish you.</span> There are not three classes or orders of office-bearers here mentioned - those who labored among them, those who presided over them, and those who admonished them (Mac-knight); but all these duties belonged to one class, namely, the presbyters. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:12-15 The ministers of the gospel are described by the work of their office, which is to serve and honour the Lord. It is their duty not only to give good counsel, but also to warn the flock of dangers, and reprove for whatever may be amiss. The people should honour and love their ministers, because their business is the welfare of men's souls. And the people should be at peace among themselves, doing all they can to guard against any differences. But love of peace must not make us wink at sin. The fearful and sorrowful spirits, should be encouraged, and a kind word may do much good. We must bear and forbear. We must be long-suffering, and keep down anger, and this to all men. Whatever man do to us, we must do good to others.</body></html>
