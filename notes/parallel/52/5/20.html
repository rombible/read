It is because of this double effect of gloominess, inward upon themselves, and outward upon others, that the command, "Quench not," occurs between the exhortation to thanksgiving and the warning not to despise prophecy. This seems to be the most natural way of accounting for the present warning, but there are two other main interpretations:--(1) It is said that what tempted the Thessalonians to disparage prophecy was their fascination for the more showy gift of tongues. It is true that such was the case at Corinth, and not unnaturally so; and at first sight it seems as if, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-1.htm" title="Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.">1Corinthians 14:1</a>, "spiritual gifts" were contrasted with "prophecy" as two separate classes, thus giving some ground for Bishop Words-worth's interpretation of our present passage--viz., that <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-19.htm" title="Quench not the Spirit.">1Thessalonians 5:19</a> refers to the gifts of tongues, miracles, &c., in something of the same contrast with "prophecy" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-20.htm" title="Despise not prophesyings.">1Thessalonians 5:20</a> as may be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-39.htm" title="Why, brothers, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.">1Corinthians 14:39</a>. But, on the other hand, it seems more likely that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-1.htm" title="Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.">1Corinthians 14:1</a> prophecy is not contrasted with the spiritual gifts there specified as a separate class, but selected <span class= "ital">from among</span> them: "It is all very well to covet spiritual gifts as a whole, but it would be better to aim more particularly at that one--prophecy--which is the greatest:" just so here, "Do not quench the Spirit, in whatever direction it may blaze up; but especially do not disparage preaching." Besides, there is nothing to prove that the Thessalonians were dazzled by the more brilliant gifts: and it accords better with the context to suppose that the fault to be corrected in them was not a light sensationalism, but a tendency to damp all ardour alike. (2) Others suppose that the Thessalonians had had experience of persons who had <span class= "ital">abused</span> the gift of prophecy, and therefore were disposed to suspect and dislike prophecy altogether. This view gains support from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.">2Thessalonians 2:2</a>, and also from the command in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm" title="Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.">1Thessalonians 5:21</a> to test, and retain only what stood the test. There is no particular ground for contradicting this view; but it is unnecessary, and does not carry on the thought so connectedly.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Despise not prophesyings.</span> This refers to the miraculous gift of prophecy possessed by the primitive Church. And by prophesyings here we are to understand, not the prediction of the future, but inspired discourse, conducive to the instruction and edification of the Church. "By the term 'prophesying,'" observes Calvin, "I do not understand the gift of foretelling the future, but the science of interpreting Scripture, so that a prophet is an interpreter of the will of God." This useful gift, it would seem, was apt to be despised, and the inferior miraculous gift of tongues to be preferred before it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-1.htm">1 Corinthians 14:1-3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:16-22 We are to rejoice in creature-comforts, as if we rejoiced not, and must not expect to live many years, and rejoice in them all; but if we do rejoice in God, we may do that evermore. A truly religious life is a life of constant joy. And we should rejoice more, if we prayed more. Prayer will help forward all lawful business, and every good work. If we pray without ceasing, we shall not want matter for thanksgiving in every thing. We shall see cause to give thanks for sparing and preventing, for common and uncommon, past and present, temporal and spiritual mercies. Not only for prosperous and pleasing, but also for afflicting providences, for chastisements and corrections; for God designs all for our good, though we at present see not how they tend to it. Quench not the Spirit. Christians are said to be baptized with the Holy Ghost and with fire. He worketh as fire, by enlightening, enlivening, and purifying the souls of men. As fire is put out by taking away fuel, and as it is quenched by pouring water, or putting a great deal of earth upon it; so we must be careful not to quench the Holy Spirit, by indulging carnal lusts and affections, minding only earthly things. Believers often hinder their growth in grace, by not giving themselves up to the spiritual affections raised in their hearts by the Holy Spirit. By prophesyings, here understand the preaching of the word, the interpreting and applying the Scriptures. We must not despise preaching, though it is plain, and we are told no more than what we knew before. We must search the Scriptures. And proving all things must be to hold fast that which is good. We should abstain from sin, and whatever looks like sin, leads to it, and borders upon it. He who is not shy of the appearances of sin, who shuns not the occasions of it, and who avoids not the temptations and approaches to it, will not long keep from doing sin.</body></html>
