The flock will be more apt to receive the discipline when they see with what apostolic authority their pastors are armed. Several special parts of the clerical office are then enumerated.<p><span class= "bld">Warn.</span>--The same Greek word as "admonish" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm" title="And we beseech you, brothers, to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;">1Thessalonians 5:12</a>, and selected for that very reason. The "unruly" or "disorderly" are those who infringe good discipline--said of soldiers who leave their ranks: here notably of those mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-11.htm" title="For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.">2Thessalonians 3:11</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Feebleminded.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">fainthearted, pusillanimous.</span> Such persons, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>as were overburdened with sorrow for the dead, or afraid of the persecutions, or the like.<p><span class= "bld">Support the weak.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">keep hold</span> of them, to help them on.

Different modes of treatment have to be adapted to different classes; the unruly have to be warned. The word here rendered "unruly" or "disorderly" was originally a military term expressing the character of those soldiers who would not keep their ranks - out of the ranks. It would seem from this and other intimations that disorders existed among the Thessalonians; and that, especially being impressed by a belief in the near approach of the advent, several of them neglected the common duties of life, and abstained from working. <span class="cmt_word">Comfort the feebleminded.</span> By "the feeble-minded" are meant the desponding or faint-hearted; those who were agitated about the fate of their deceased friends, or those who despaired of the grace of God by reason of their sins. These were not to be reprimanded, but comforted and exhorted. <span class="cmt_word">Support the weak.</span> By "the weak" are not meant those who are physically weak - the sick; but those who are spiritually weak, whose faith was feeble - those who were afraid of persecution, or were troubled with vain scruples. These were to be supported - confirmed in the faith, <span class="cmt_word">be patient toward all men</span>; all men in general, whether believers or unbelievers; toward them patience and forbearance were to be exercised. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:12-15 The ministers of the gospel are described by the work of their office, which is to serve and honour the Lord. It is their duty not only to give good counsel, but also to warn the flock of dangers, and reprove for whatever may be amiss. The people should honour and love their ministers, because their business is the welfare of men's souls. And the people should be at peace among themselves, doing all they can to guard against any differences. But love of peace must not make us wink at sin. The fearful and sorrowful spirits, should be encouraged, and a kind word may do much good. We must bear and forbear. We must be long-suffering, and keep down anger, and this to all men. Whatever man do to us, we must do good to others.</body></html>
