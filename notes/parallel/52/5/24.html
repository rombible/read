He who calls you to the Christian faith is faithful to fulfill his promises. God's calling is the commencement of a series which terminates in glorification (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>). A similar appeal to the faithfulness of God is elsewhere made by the apostle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-9.htm">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who also will do it</span>; namely, will preserve you blameless unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:23-28 The apostle prays that they might be sanctified more perfectly, for the best are sanctified but in part while in this world; therefore we should pray for, and press toward, complete holiness. And as we must fall, if God did not carry on his good work in the soul, we should pray to God to perfect his work, till we are presented faultless before the throne of his glory. We should pray for one another; and brethren should thus express brotherly love. This epistle was to be read to all the brethren. Not only are the common people allowed to read the Scriptures, but it is their duty, and what they should be persuaded to do. The word of God should not be kept in an unknown tongue, but transplanted, that as all men are concerned to know the Scriptures, so they all may be able to read them. The Scriptures should be read in all public congregations, for the benefit of the unlearned especially. We need no more to make us happy, than to know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. He is an ever-flowing and an over-flowing fountain of grace to supply all our wants.</body></html>
