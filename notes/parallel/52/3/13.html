Perfect and settled sanctification in the eyes of God is the object in view, and the means by which it is to be attained is growing and overflowing love toward mankind. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-14.htm" title=" And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfection.">Colossians 3:14</a>.) St. Paul is already thinking, probably, how he shall treat the subject of chastity in the next chapter. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm" title="That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.">1Thessalonians 4:6</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Before God . . .</span> <span class= "bld">at the coming.</span>--The hearts are to be unblamably holy before God--not only all through life, but also at the Judgment Day, when Jesus Christ is to judge us in the Father's presence. Though He has "committed all judgment unto the Son" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-22.htm" title="For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son:">John 5:22</a>), yet the judgment is His own, and the Son is the agent <span class= "ital">by</span> whom He judges, just as He is the agent by whom He creates (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-31.htm" title="Because he has appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained; whereof he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.">Acts 17:31</a>): therefore in that day it is in the Father's sight rather than in the Son's (though there can be no divergence between Them) that we are to be able to clear ourselves.<p><span class= "bld">With all his saints</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, attended by them:-<p>"Thousand, thousand saints <span class= "ital">attending,<p>Swell the triumph of His train."</span><p>The word might possibly be stretched to include the holy angels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm" title="And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-13.htm" title="I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;">Daniel 4:13</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>); but here we may more probably suppose that St. Paul is anticipating his teaching of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm" title="For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.">1Thessalonians 4:14</a>, and besides, the Greek seems almost to indicate that these "saints" are to be assessors in the judgment--an honour to be given only to holy men.

Prayer is to be offered to God as our Father. Prayer is not only to be offered in the name of Christ, but offered up to Christ himself, as our Lord and our Saviour. Let us acknowledge God in all our ways, and he will direct our paths. Mutual love is required of all Christians. And love is of God, and is fulfilling the gospel as well as the law. We need the Spirit's influences in order to our growth in grace; and the way to obtain them, is prayer. Holiness is required of all who would go to heaven; and we must act so that we do not contradict the profession we make of holiness. The Lord Jesus will certainly come in his glory; his saints will come with him. Then the excellence as well as the necessity of holiness will appear; and without this no hearts shall be established at that day, nor shall any avoid condemnation.</body></html>
