At the same time the "if" has the half-future sense, as though St. Paul meant that the continuance of this "life" was contingent upon their continued steadfastness. Another interpretation has been suggested, according to which both the "we" and "ye" are perfectly general, and therefore interchangeable, and the sense is made to be a vague proposition, "for standing fast in the Lord is a <span class= "ital">sine qua non</span> of life"--life in the theological sense: and parts of Romans 7, 8 are compared. This interpretation, however, suits the Greek as little as the context.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For now we live.</span> Not to be referred to the eternal and future life (Chrysostom); or to be weakened as if it merely signified, "We relish and enjoy life notwithstanding our affliction and distress" (Pelt); but the meaning is the good tidings which Timothy has brought have imparted new life unto us; "we are in the full strength and freshness of life, we do not feel the sorrows and tribulations which the outer world prepares for us" (Lunemann). The apostle considers his condition of affliction and distress as a kind of death: so, elsewhere he says, "I die daily" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-31.htm">1 Corinthians 15:31</a>); and from which death he was now again raised to life. <span class="cmt_word">If</span>; provided - a hypothetical assumption. <span class="cmt_word">Ye stand fast</span>; continue firm in the faith of the gospel. <span class="cmt_word">In the Lord</span>; the element of true life. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:6-10 Thankfulness to God is very imperfect in the present state; but one great end of the ministry of the word is to help faith forward.
