Such a distinction is, however, precarious. The words do not refer to the apostle's anxiety on account of the Thessalonians, for that was removed by the coming of Timothy. Clearly some external trouble is denoted. Paul, when he preached the gospel at Corinth, and before he obtained the protection of Gallio, was exposed to much persecution and danger. The Jews had expelled him from their synagogue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-6.htm">Acts 18:6</a>), and attempts had been made against him which at length broke out into an insurrection against him, when he was dragged before the Roman tribunal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12</a>). His condition at Corinth when he wrote this Epistle was dark and gloomy. <span class="cmt_word">By your faith</span>; by the steadfastness of your faith. The good news which Timothy brought of the faith and love of the Thessalonians comforted the apostle amid all the trials and difficulties and disappointments of his ministry (comp. with this passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-4.htm">2 Corinthians 7:4-7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:6-10 Thankfulness to God is very imperfect in the present state; but one great end of the ministry of the word is to help faith forward. That which was the instrument to obtain faith, is also the means of increasing and confirming it, namely, the ordinances of God; and as faith cometh by hearing, so it is confirmed by hearing also.</body></html>
