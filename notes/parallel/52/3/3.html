Our afflictions do not result from chance, but are the necessary consequence of our Christianity; they arise from the appointment and ordinance of God. Tribulation is the Christian's portion. Whatever truth there may be in the saying that prosperity is the promise of the Old Testament, affliction is certainly the promise of the New. We must be conformed to Christ in his sufferings. "In the world," says our Lord, "ye shall have tribulation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>). When our Lord called Paul to his apostleship, he showed him how great things he must suffer for his Name's sake (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-16.htm">Acts 9:16</a>). All the apostles suffered from persecution, and concerning Christians in general Paul asserts that it is only through tribulation that they can enter into the kingdom of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 The more we find pleasure in the ways of God, the more we shall desire to persevere therein. The apostle's design was to establish and comfort the Thessalonians as to the object of their faith, that Jesus Christ was the Saviour of the world; and as to the recompence of faith, which was more than enough to make up all their losses, and to reward all their labours. But he feared his labours would be in vain. If the devil cannot hinder ministers from labouring in the word and doctrine, he will, if possible, hinder the success of their labours. No one would willingly labour in vain. It is the will and purpose of God, that we enter into his kingdom through many afflictions. And the apostles, far from flattering people with the expectation of worldly prosperity in religion, told them plainly they must count upon trouble in the flesh. Herein they followed the example of their great Master, the Author of our faith. Christians were in danger, and they should be forewarned; they will thus be kept from being improved by any devices of the tempter.</body></html>
