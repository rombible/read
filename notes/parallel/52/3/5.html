The striking out of the comma after "tempted you," and reading the clauses quickly together, will give a fair notion of the purport. It might be paraphrased, "Lest, in consequence of the temptations which the tempter brought against you, our toil should prove in vain." The "temptations" were those of persecution, and the time at which they befell, the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-4.htm" title="For truly, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and you know.">1Thessalonians 3:4</a>, "it came to pass."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this cause, when I could no longer forbear</span>; no longer repress my anxiety, and endure my want of information concerning you. <span class="cmt_word">I sent to know your faith</span>; to receive information concerning your spiritual condition. <span class="cmt_word">Lest by some means the tempter</span>; a designation of Satan, used also by <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-3.htm">Matthew 4:3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Have tempted you, and our labor be in vain</span>; that is, useless, without result (see on 1 Thessalonians 2:1; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-11.htm">Galatians 4:11</a>, "I am afraid, lest I have bestowed upon you labor in vain"). The temptation to which the Thessalonians were exposed was that of apostasy from Christianity, through the fear or endurance of persecution. That the tempter had tempted them is probable - it was almost unavoidable; that he had succeeded in his temptation, and had thus rendered the apostle's labors among them useless, was uncertain - a contingency which might possibly have taken place. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 The more we find pleasure in the ways of God, the more we shall desire to persevere therein. The apostle's design was to establish and comfort the Thessalonians as to the object of their faith, that Jesus Christ was the Saviour of the world; and as to the recompence of faith, which was more than enough to make up all their losses, and to reward all their labours. But he feared his labours would be in vain. If the devil cannot hinder ministers from labouring in the word and doctrine, he will, if possible, hinder the success of their labours. No one would willingly labour in vain. It is the will and purpose of God, that we enter into his kingdom through many afflictions. And the apostles, far from flattering people with the expectation of worldly prosperity in religion, told them plainly they must count upon trouble in the flesh. Herein they followed the example of their great Master, the Author of our faith. Christians were in danger, and they should be forewarned; they will thus be kept from being improved by any devices of the tempter.</body></html>
