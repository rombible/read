But the word is probably added without such specific reference: "May God Himself direct us; for in that case who could hinder?"<p><span class= "bld">And our Lord . . .</span>--An important theological passage. From the use of the <span class= "ital">singular</span> in the verb "direct" (which of course the English cannot express), some divines argue in favour of the Catholic doctrine of "homosion," or <span class= "ital">substantial</span> unity of the Son with the Father: it must not, however, be too strongly pressed, or it might otherwise lead to the false notion of a <span class= "ital">personal</span> unity between Them. Nevertheless, we may admit that the prayer (or, rather, <span class= "ital">wish</span>) implies the <span class= "ital">equality</span> of the two Persons, and that it would have been inconceivable for a Catholic Christian to have used the verb in the plural. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-17.htm" title="Comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work.">2Thessalonians 2:17</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now God himself and our Father</span>; or, as we would express it according to the English idiom, <span class="accented">God himself, our Father</span>, omitting the conjunction. <span class="cmt_word">And our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> Some suppose that the three Divine Persons of the sacred Trinity are here expressly named: God the Holy Ghost, and the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ; but the words in the original will not bear this sense: "God himself and our Father" is the same Divine Person. <span class="cmt_word">Direct</span>. It is to be observed that the verb "direct" is in the Greek in the singular, thus denoting a unity between God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. At all events, we have an express prayer directed to Christ, thus necessarily implying his Divine nature. <span class="cmt_word">Our way unto you.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:11-13 Prayer is religious worship, and all religious worship is due unto God only. Prayer is to be offered to God as our Father. Prayer is not only to be offered in the name of Christ, but offered up to Christ himself, as our Lord and our Saviour. Let us acknowledge God in all our ways, and he will direct our paths. Mutual love is required of all Christians. And love is of God, and is fulfilling the gospel as well as the law. We need the Spirit's influences in order to our growth in grace; and the way to obtain them, is prayer. Holiness is required of all who would go to heaven; and we must act so that we do not contradict the profession we make of holiness. The Lord Jesus will certainly come in his glory; his saints will come with him. Then the excellence as well as the necessity of holiness will appear; and without this no hearts shall be established at that day, nor shall any avoid condemnation.</body></html>
