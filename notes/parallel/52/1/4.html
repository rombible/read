The tense of the word "beloved" represents not only God's attitude to them in the present, but the long continuance of it in the past, especially as proved by His election of them. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-28.htm" title="And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.">Romans 8:28-30</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:">2Thessalonians 2:13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Election,</span> in the language of (at any rate) St. Paul and St. Peter, seems primarily to refer to a gracious admission into religious privileges in <span class= "ital">this</span> life. The word implies nothing as to the final condition of the person thus elected (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-10.htm" title="Why the rather, brothers, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if you do these things, you shall never fall:">2Peter 1:10</a>, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:">Ephesians 1:4</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/5-5.htm" title="For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.">Ephesians 5:5-7</a>). God <span class= "ital">elects</span> us to become members of the Holy Church, and <span class= "ital">all</span> baptised persons are <span class= "ital">elect, </span>with heaven in reversion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/1-2.htm" title="Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, be multiplied.">1Peter 1:2-5</a>); but they may, according as they please, unsettle their election, or make it sure. St. Paul rejoices, because the continued possession of spiritual privileges, used or abused, is an assurance of God's continued "favour and goodness towards us." Of course, however, this observation does not much affect the mysterious doctrine of predestination. The question must still remain why God brings some in this life to the knowledge of His truth, and others not; but the observation, at any rate, destroys the notion of an arbitrary damnation and salvation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Knowing</span>; that is, not the Thessalonians themselves, but we, Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus; knowing, being well assured cf. <span class="cmt_word">Brethren beloved</span>, your election of God; or rather, as it is in the margin and in the R.V., <span class="accented">Knowing brethren, beloved of God, your election.</span> By election is meant that act of free grace by which God destines individuals to become believers in Christ. Thus the Thessalonian converts were chosen or elected by God from among their heathen countrymen to become Christians. The ultimate reason of their Christianity was their election of God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 As all good comes from God, so no good can be hoped for by sinners, but from God in Christ. And the best good may be expected from God, as our Father, for the sake of Christ. We should pray, not only for ourselves, but for others also; remembering them without ceasing. Wherever there is a true faith, it will work; it will affect both the heart and life. Faith works by love; it shows itself in love to God, and love to our neighbour. And wherever there is a well-grounded hope of eternal life, this will appear by the exercise of patience; and it is a sign of sincerity, when in all we do, we seek to approve ourselves to God. By this we may know our election, if we not only speak of the things of God with out lips, but feel their power in our hearts, mortifying our lusts, weaning us from the world, and raising us up to heavenly things. Unless the Spirit of God comes with the word of God, it will be to us a dead letter. Thus they entertained it by the power of the Holy Ghost. They were fully convinced of the truth of it, so as not to be shaken in mind by objections and doubts; and they were willing to leave all for Christ, and to venture their souls and everlasting condition upon the truth of the gospel revelation.</body></html>
