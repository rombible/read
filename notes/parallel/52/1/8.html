The clauses are not quite logically balanced.<p><span class= "bld">Your faith</span> does not mean "your creed," but "the report of your extraordinary faith."<p><span class= "bld">To say anything</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, about our success at Thessalonica.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>; or, <span class="accented">because</span> the proof of tiffs praise conferred on the Thessalonians. <span class="cmt_word">From you sounded out.</span> Resounded like the sound of a trumpet. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-18.htm">Romans 10:18</a>, "Their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the end of the world." <span class="cmt_word">The word of the Lord.</span> This does not intimate that the Thessalonians by their missionary activity disseminated the gospel, but that from them locally the-gospel had spread. <span class="cmt_word">Not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad.</span> There is a slight difficulty in the construction. The sentence is complete without the addition, "your faith to God-ward is spread abroad," and, therefore, we must consider these words as equivalent to "<span class="accented">from</span> you sounded out the word of the Lord." When the apostle says that "<span class="accented">the</span> faith of the Thessalonians is spread abroad in every place," the meaning is that the report of their joyful reception of the gospel had excited universal attention. There is here a certain use of the figure hyperbole. The words, "in every place," are not to be taken in their full literal sense, but are merely a strong expression for the wide diffusion of the faith of the Thessalonians. Paul uses similar hyperboles in other places, as when he speaks of the faith of the Romans being spoken of throughout the whole world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>), and of the gospel having come into all the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6</a>). This wide diffusion of the Faith of the Thessalonians, notwithstanding the recent date of their conversion, may be accounted for when we consider that Thessalonica and Corinth were two great commercial cities, from and to which there was a constant coming and going, so that reports might easily be transmitted by merchants and strangers. It has also been suggested that Aquila and Priscilla, who had lately come from Rome (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-2.htm">Acts 18:2</a>), must in their journey have passed through Thessalonica, and would bring with them to Corinth such a report of the faith of the Thessalonians (Wieseler). <span class="cmt_word">So that we need not to speak anything</span>; that is, of your faith, as this is already so well known and applauded. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:6-10 When careless, ignorant, and immoral persons are turned from their carnal pursuits and connexions, to believe in and obey the Lord Jesus, to live soberly, righteously, and godly, the matter speaks for itself. The believers under the Old Testament waited for the coming of the Messiah, and believers now wait for his second coming. He is yet to come. And God had raised him from the dead, which is a full assurance unto all men that he will come to judgment. He came to purchase salvation, and will, when he comes again, bring salvation with him, full and final deliverance from that wrath which is yet to come. Let all, without delay, flee from the wrath to come, and seek refuge in Christ and his salvation.</body></html>
