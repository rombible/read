The genitive in such phrases as "work of faith," etc., is almost equivalent to a very emphatic adjective--"faithful activity," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>a work characterised by faith and prompted by faith, such as faith alone could have enabled you to accomplish; so "labour of love" is similarly equivalent to "loving labour," laborious toil undertaken for love's sake, and done in the spirit of love; and "patience of hope" to "hopeful endurance of trials," a steadfast endurance which is grounded upon and cheered by hope.<p><span class= "bld">In our Lord.</span>--More correctly, <span class= "ital">of</span> The words in the Greek go with all three clauses: He is the object of the faith and love, as well as of the hope. This "hope of our Lord" includes, but is not limited to, the hope of His second Advent.<p><span class= "bld">In the sight of God</span> goes closely with "remembering," and is equivalent to "in prayer."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remembering without ceasing.</span> Some attach the words, "without ceasing," or "unceasingly," to the previous clause; "making mention of you unceasingly in our prayers" (so Alford). <span class="cmt_word">Your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope.</span> These expressions are not to be weakened, as if they were a mere Hebraism for active faith, laborious love, and patient hope. We have here the three cardinal virtues - faith, love, and hope (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>). Elsewhere these graces are combined. Thus again in this Epistle: "Putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:8</a>); and in the Epistle to the Colossians: "Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all saints, for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4, 5</a>). By the "work of faith" is not meant faith itself as the work of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-29.htm">John 6:29</a>), but that faith which is energetic, which is active and living, productive of good works. By the "labor, or toil, of love" is not meant that love which is devoted to God, but that love which manifests itself in acts of kindness toward our fellow-Christians and toward the human race. And by the "patience of hope" is meant that constancy which remains unconquered by trials and persecutions. There is a climax here; faith manifests itself by its works - its active exertion; love by its toils - its works of self-denial; and hope by its patience - its endurance amid trials and discouragements. "Remembering, the apostle would say, your faith, hope, and love: a faith that had its outward effect on your lives; a love that spent itself in the service of others; and a hope that was no mere transient feeling, but was content to wait for the things unseen, when Christ should be revealed" (Jowett). <span class="cmt_word">In our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> These words do not refer to all three virtues (Hohnann), but only to the last, specifying its object, namely, that it is hope in the advent of the Lord Jesus Christ. This is hope s highest expectation, because at the advent the kingdom of Christ will come in its glory. <span class="cmt_word">In the sight of</span> (or rather, <span class="accented">before</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>God and</span> <span class="cmt_word">our Father.</span> These words are to be conjoined with "remembering:" "remembering unceasingly before God and our Father your work of faith," etc. According to the English idiom, the conjunction "and" is dropped - "God our Father." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 As all good comes from God, so no good can be hoped for by sinners, but from God in Christ. And the best good may be expected from God, as our Father, for the sake of Christ. We should pray, not only for ourselves, but for others also; remembering them without ceasing. Wherever there is a true faith, it will work; it will affect both the heart and life. Faith works by love; it shows itself in love to God, and love to our neighbour. And wherever there is a well-grounded hope of eternal life, this will appear by the exercise of patience; and it is a sign of sincerity, when in all we do, we seek to approve ourselves to God. By this we may know our election, if we not only speak of the things of God with out lips, but feel their power in our hearts, mortifying our lusts, weaning us from the world, and raising us up to heavenly things. Unless the Spirit of God comes with the word of God, it will be to us a dead letter. Thus they entertained it by the power of the Holy Ghost. They were fully convinced of the truth of it, so as not to be shaken in mind by objections and doubts; and they were willing to leave all for Christ, and to venture their souls and everlasting condition upon the truth of the gospel revelation.</body></html>
