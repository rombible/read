Many expositors (Cony-beare, Koch, Jowett) suppose that the plural is here used for the singular; as Paul elsewhere does in other parts of this Epistle. Thus: "Wherefore we would come unto you, even <span class="cmt_word">I Paul,</span> once and again" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:18</a>); "Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1</a>). In these verses the pronoun "we" is evidently restricted to Paul. Still, however, Silvanus and Timotheus being mentioned directly before, it is most natural to include them here. <span class="cmt_word">Give thanks to God always for you all.</span> All Paul's Epistles, with the solitary exception of the Epistle to the Galatians, commence with an expression of thanksgiving. <span class="cmt_word">Making mention of you in our prayers</span>; whilst we are engaged in prayer for you. Paul's prayer for the Thessalonians took the form of thanksgiving. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 As all good comes from God, so no good can be hoped for by sinners, but from God in Christ. And the best good may be expected from God, as our Father, for the sake of Christ. We should pray, not only for ourselves, but for others also; remembering them without ceasing. Wherever there is a true faith, it will work; it will affect both the heart and life. Faith works by love; it shows itself in love to God, and love to our neighbour. And wherever there is a well-grounded hope of eternal life, this will appear by the exercise of patience; and it is a sign of sincerity, when in all we do, we seek to approve ourselves to God. By this we may know our election, if we not only speak of the things of God with out lips, but feel their power in our hearts, mortifying our lusts, weaning us from the world, and raising us up to heavenly things. Unless the Spirit of God comes with the word of God, it will be to us a dead letter. Thus they entertained it by the power of the Holy Ghost. They were fully convinced of the truth of it, so as not to be shaken in mind by objections and doubts; and they were willing to leave all for Christ, and to venture their souls and everlasting condition upon the truth of the gospel revelation.</body></html>
