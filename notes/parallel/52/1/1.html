Some see in the omission a mark of the early date of the letter, before St. Paul had assumed the title; others think he omits it in courtesy to his companions, to whom it could not be given. Both theories are disproved by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-6.htm" title="Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.">1Thessalonians 2:6</a>. Silas takes precedence of Timothy (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/17-14.htm" title="And then immediately the brothers sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus stayed there still.">Acts 17:14-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-5.htm" title="And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.">Acts 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:">2Thessalonians 1:1</a>) as a man of higher standing. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-22.htm" title="Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:">Acts 15:22</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-12.htm" title="Let no man despise your youth; but be you an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.">1Timothy 4:12</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">In God.</span>--Other Thessalonians were "in the world," "in darkness," "in their sins." The distinctive mark of <span class= "ital">these</span> was that they were re-united to the Father of all men; and more, re-united in Christ. The words following "peace" should be struck out, not being found in the best text.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Paul</span>. He does not call himself "an apostle," not because the Thessalonians were newly converted (Chrysostom), or from tenderness to Silvanus who was not an apostle (Estius), or because his apostolic authority was not yet recognized (Jowett), or because he had merely commenced his apostolic labors (Wordsworth); but because his apostleship had never been called in question by the Thessalonians. For the same reason he omits this title in the Epistle to the Philippians; whereas he strongly insists upon it in his Epistles to the Corinthians and Galatians, because among them there were many opposed to his authority. <span class="cmt_word">And Silvanus.</span> The same as the Silas of the Acts. He is mentioned as a chief man among the brethren, and a prophet or inspired teacher (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22, 32</a>). His Latin name renders it probable that he was a Hellenistic Jew, and, like Paul, he was a Roman citizen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-37.htm">Acts 16:37</a>). He was sent with Judas Barsabas from Jerusalem, to convey the apostolic decrees to Antioch; and he accompanied Paul instead of Barnabas on his second missionary journey (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-40.htm">Acts 15:40</a>). He suffered imprisonment with Paul at Philippi; and was engaged with him in preaching the gospel in Thessalonica, Beraea, and Corinth. His ministry at Corinth is honorably mentioned by Paul in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-9.htm">2 Corinthians 1:9</a>). After this there is no more mention of Silvanus in the Acts, and it is doubtful whether he was the Silvanus by whom the First Epistle of Peter was conveyed to the Churches of Asia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>). Ancient tradition, erroneously supposing that Silas and Silvanus were different persons, makes Silas the Bishop of Corinth, and Silvanus the Bishop of Thessalonica. <span class="cmt_word">And Timotheus.</span> The well-known disciple of Paul. He was a native of Lystra, having a Greek father and a Jewish mother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-1.htm">Acts 16:1</a>). He joined Paul and Silas on their second missionary journey at Lystra, and was with them in Philippi, Thessalonica, and Corinth. He was with Paul on his third missionary journey, and was sent by him on a mission to Macedonia and Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-10.htm">1 Corinthians 16:10</a>), and accompanied him into Asia on his last journey to Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>). He was also with Paul during his first Roman imprisonment, when he wrote the Epistles to the Philippians and Colossians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-1.htm">Colossians 1:1</a>). Afterwards he resided at Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>); from which he was recalled to Rome by Paul shortly before his martyrdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-21.htm">2 Timothy 4:21</a>). The last mention of Timothy is in the Epistle to the Hebrews: "Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-23.htm">Hebrews 13:23</a>). According to ecclesiastical tradition, he became Bishop of Ephesus, and there suffered martyrdom. Silvanus and Timotheus are associated with Paul in his address to the Thessalonians, not to give weight and authority to his Epistle, but because they assisted him in the planting of the Church at Thessalonica, and were now with him at Corinth, when he was writing this Epistle. Silvanus is placed first, because he was the older and had been longer with the apostle, and, as is evident from the Acts, was at this time the more important of the two (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-19.htm">Acts 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4</a>). By being included in the address, they are represented as joint authors of the Epistle with Paul, although they were only so in name. It is possible that Paul employed one of them as his amanuensis in writing the Epistle. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the Church.</span> The word "Church" denotes a select assembly; here, Christians selected from the world. It does not denote in the New Testament, as with us, a building, but the congregation. In Paul's later Epistles, those addressed are called, not the Church, but saints. <span class="cmt_word">Of the Thessalonians.</span> In other Epistles the address is to the city, as Rome, Philippi, Colosse; here it is to the inhabitants. The Church of the Thessalonians was chiefly composed of converted Gentiles, with a small number of converted Jews (see Introduction). <span class="accented">Which is</span>; to be omitted, as not being in the original. <span class="cmt_word">In God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ.</span> The characteristic peculiarity of the Church: they are in God and Christ, that is, in fellowship with them, united to them. "In God the Father" characterizes them as not being heathens; "in the Lord Jesus Christ" characterizes them as not being Jews. <span class="cmt_word">Grace be unto you, and peace.</span> The usual apostolic benediction. "Grace" is the Greek and" peace" is the Jewish form of salutation. The Greeks commenced their epistles with wishing grace for those to whom they wrote; and the usual form of salutation among the Jews was <span class="accented">Shalom</span> or "peace;" the apostle combines them, thus intimating that both Greeks and Jews are one in Christ Jesus. In the Pastoral Epistles and in the Second Epistle of John the form is "Grace, mercy, and peace" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-3.htm">2 John 1:3</a>.), and in the Epistle of Jude it is "Mercy, peace, and love" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-2.htm">Jude 1:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</span> These words are wanting in some important manuscripts, and are omitted in the R.V. The preponderance, however, of external authority is in their favor. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 As all good comes from God, so no good can be hoped for by sinners, but from God in Christ. And the best good may be expected from God, as our Father, for the sake of Christ. We should pray, not only for ourselves, but for others also; remembering them without ceasing. Wherever there is a true faith, it will work; it will affect both the heart and life. Faith works by love; it shows itself in love to God, and love to our neighbour. And wherever there is a well-grounded hope of eternal life, this will appear by the exercise of patience; and it is a sign of sincerity, when in all we do, we seek to approve ourselves to God. By this we may know our election, if we not only speak of the things of God with out lips, but feel their power in our hearts, mortifying our lusts, weaning us from the world, and raising us up to heavenly things. Unless the Spirit of God comes with the word of God, it will be to us a dead letter. Thus they entertained it by the power of the Holy Ghost. They were fully convinced of the truth of it, so as not to be shaken in mind by objections and doubts; and they were willing to leave all for Christ, and to venture their souls and everlasting condition upon the truth of the gospel revelation.</body></html>
