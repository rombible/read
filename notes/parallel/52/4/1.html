The first point on which the Thessalonians need instruction is in the matter of social purity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm" title="Furthermore then we beseech you, brothers, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more.">1Thessalonians 4:1-8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Furthermore</span> hardly expresses the original. St. Paul is not adding a further injunction, for he has as yet given none. It is literally, <span class= "ital">For the rest, then; </span>and serves to introduce the conclusion of the letter.<p><span class= "bld">Beseech.</span>--The marginal <span class= "ital">request</span> is better, the word being one of calm and friendly asking, implying that the person so addressed will recognise the propriety of complying.<p><span class= "bld">Exhort</span> is correct, though "encourage" suits the context a little better, as assuming that they are already so acting, but not with enough heart.<p><span class= "bld">By the Lord.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">in the Lord.</span> It is not an adjuration, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a>, but states the authoritative ground of his request. "We encourage you, on the strength of our union in the Lord Jesus." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.">1Thessalonians 1:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">How ye ought to walk.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the how.</span> It indicates that part of the apostolic tradition was a systematic moral code, almost as if it were the title of a well-known book. "We gave you the 'How ye ought to walk, so as to please God.'" The best texts add immediately after, "even as also ye walk."<p><span class= "bld">Abound more and more.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">still more.</span> "You <span class= "ital">did</span> receive of us the rules of a holy life; you <span class= "ital">are</span> living by them, and that to a very large degree; but we beg you and encourage you, on the faith of Christians, to be still more lavish in your self-denial."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Furthermore</span>; literally, <span class="accented">finally</span>; <span class="accented">for the rest - introducing</span> the closing or practical part of the Epistle. The apostle uses the same word elsewhere at the close of his Epistles (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">therefore</span>; connecting this exhortation with the closing verses of the last chapter: In order that you may be established un-blamably in holiness at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, you must do your part, you must earnestly strive after holiness. <span class="cmt_word">We</span>; to be restricted to Paul. <span class="cmt_word">Beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">in the Lord Jesus</span>; that is, in fellowship with him - the sphere or element within which the apostle besought and exhorted the Thessalonians. He wrote as the organ or instrument of the Lord Jesus. That as ye have received of us. Paul here appeals to the exhortations which he gave them during his residence among them at Thessalonica. <span class="cmt_word">How ye ought to walk and to please God</span>; how you ought to conduct yourselves so as to please God. The walking was the means of pleasing. The R.V., after these words, on the authority of manuscripts, adds, "even as ye do walk." <span class="cmt_word">So ye</span> <span class="cmt_word">would abound more and more.</span> The apostle acknowledges their Christian walking; they had already entered upon the road; their conduct was sanctified; but he exhorts them to abound therein with still greater care and fidelity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-8 To abide in the faith of the gospel is not enough, we must abound in the work of faith. The rule according to which all ought to walk and act, is the commandments given by the Lord Jesus Christ. Sanctification, in the renewal of their souls under the influences of the Holy Spirit, and attention to appointed duties, constituted the will of God respecting them. In aspiring after this renewal of the soul unto holiness, strict restraint must be put upon the appetites and senses of the body, and on the thoughts and inclinations of the will, which lead to wrong uses of them. The Lord calls none into his family to live unholy lives, but that they may be taught and enabled to walk before him in holiness. Some make light of the precepts of holiness, because they hear them from men; but they are God's commands, and to break them is to despise God.</body></html>
