The simpler words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-13.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from now on: Yes, said the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.">Revelation 14:13</a> mean "dying in full communion still with Him." Our present phrase makes Him, as it were, the <span class= "ital">way, </span>or <span class= "ital">door, by which</span> they journeyed to death: He <span class= "ital">surrounded them as they sank to rest</span> (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-9.htm" title="I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.">John 10:9</a>.) Additional sweetness is imparted to the phrase by the use of the metaphor of <span class= "ital">sleep;</span> but it is, perhaps, too much to say, as Dean Alford does, that "falling asleep" is here contrasted with "dying," in this sense:--"Who through the power of Jesus fell asleep instead of dying"--for the word is even used of <span class= "ital">a judicial punishment</span> of death in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-30.htm" title="For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.">1Corinthians 11:30</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Will God bring with him</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, with Jesus. In the Greek the word <span class= "ital">God</span> stands in an unemphatic position--"Even so will God bring," implying that it was God also who had raised Jesus from the dead. But St. Paul is not content with saying, "Even so will God <span class= "ital">raise</span> those who passed through Christ to death." The thought of the Advent is so supreme with him that he passes at once to a moment beyond resurrection. If the question be asked from <span class= "ital">whence</span> God will bring the dead along with Christ, it must be answered, from Paradise, and the persons brought must be the disembodied <span class= "ital">spirits;</span> for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm" title="For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:">1Thessalonians 4:16</a> this coming of the Lord with the saints is the signal for the dead--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the <span class= "ital">bodies</span>--to rise. It must be owned, however, that this manner of speaking is unusual. Jesus is no longer in Paradise, for the spirits to be brought thence <span class= "ital">with Him;</span> and one would have expected something more like "bringing <span class= "ital">up"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-20.htm" title="Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,">Hebrews 13:20</a>), as it is always considered a <span class= "ital">descent</span> into "hell" or Paradise. Because of this difficulty (which however is more in form than reality), some take the words to mean, "God will lead them by the same path with Christ"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>will make their whole career (including resurrection) conform with His, comparing the same verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-14.htm" title="For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.">Romans 8:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again.</span> The apostle's argument proceeds on the supposition that Christ and believers are one body, of which Christ is the Head and believers are the members; and that consequently what happens to the Head must happen to the members. Our knowledge and belief of a future state, and especially of the resurrection, is founded on the resurrection of Christ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-12.htm">1 Corinthians 15:12-20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Even so them also which sleep in Jesus</span>; or more literally, <span class="accented">through Jesus. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Will God bring with him</span>; namely, with Jesus. These words are differently construed. Some read them thus: "Even so them also which sleep will God through Jesus bring with him" (De Wette, Lunemann); but this appears to be an awkward construction; as we must then render the clause, "will God through Jesus bring with Jesus." It is, therefore, better to refer the words, "through Jesus," to the first clause. It is through Jesus that believers fall asleep; it is he who changes the nature of death, for all his people, from being the king of terrors into a quiet and gentle sleep, from which they will awaken to eternal life. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:13-18 Here is comfort for the relations and friends of those who die in the Lord. Grief for the death of friends is lawful; we may weep for our own loss, though it may be their gain. Christianity does not forbid, and grace does not do away, our natural affections. Yet we must not be excessive in our sorrows; this is too much like those who have no hope of a better life. Death is an unknown thing, and we know little about the state after death; yet the doctrines of the resurrection and the second coming of Christ, are a remedy against the fear of death, and undue sorrow for the death of our Christian friends; and of these doctrines we have full assurance. It will be some happiness that all the saints shall meet, and remain together for ever; but the principal happiness of heaven is to be with the Lord, to see him, live with him, and enjoy him for ever. We should support one another in times sorrow; not deaden one another's spirits, or weaken one another's hands. And this may be done by the many lessons to be learned from the resurrection of the dead, and the second coming of Christ. What! comfort a man by telling him he is going to appear before the judgment-seat of God! Who can feel comfort from those words? That man alone with whose spirit the Spirit of God bears witness that his sins are blotted out, and the thoughts of whose heart are purified by the Holy Spirit, so that he can love God, and worthily magnify his name. We are not in a safe state unless it is thus with us, or we are desiring to be so.</body></html>
