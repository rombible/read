It is not necessary to inquire <span class= "ital">what</span> the command may be, or <span class= "ital">to whom</span> issued, inasmuch as the word does not always imply any particular <span class= "ital">orders;</span> nor <span class= "ital">who</span> is represented as uttering it: the intention is only to convey the notion of the stirring noise, in the midst of which (for the original has "in," not "with") the Lord will descend. It is, however, somewhat particularised by what follows: two notes amid those sounds of mystery strike the ear--the archangel's voice, and the trump of God. Probably, therefore, the "shout of command" is uttered by the "leader of the angels;" and the trump (called "the trump of God" because used for God's purposes) is blown to summon the mustering hosts. In favour of supposing the Lord Himself to utter the cry, may be adduced <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-25.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.">John 5:25</a>; but, on the other hand, it suits the dignity of the scene better to imagine the loud sound to come rather from one of the heralds of the great army. The preposition "in" is more effective than "with:" it calls attention to the <span class= "ital">long</span> blast. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-19.htm" title="And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.">Exodus 19:19</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Shall rise first.</span>--Not as meaning "shall be the first to rise," as contrasted with non-members of the Church who are to rise later; though that is a scriptural thought (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/20-5.htm" title="But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.">Revelation 20:5-6</a>), the Greek here refuses to be so explained. Rather, "the first thing will be the rising of the dead in Christ," contrasted with what follows--"<span class= "ital">then, </span>and not till then, shall we be caught up." The same order is carefully observed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-52.htm" title="In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.">1Corinthians 15:52</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>; assigning a reason for the above assertion, "because." <span class="cmt_word">The Lord himself</span>; not merely the Lord as the chief Person and Actor on that day, in contrast to his saints, but emphatic, "<span class="accented">the</span> Lord himself," the Lord in his own proper Person. <span class="cmt_word">Shall descend from heaven</span>; where the crucified and risen Jesus is now enthroned, seated at the right hand of God. <span class="cmt_word">With a shout</span>; a word denoting a commanding shout as that of a leader to his host when he leads them into the battle, or of the army when it rushes to the fight. Some refer this shout to what follows - the voice of the archangel and the trump of God; but there are three particulars here mentioned. Others attribute it to Christ himself. <span class="cmt_word">With the voice of the archangel</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">of an archangel.</span> There is only one archangel mentioned in Scripture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a>); the word denotes, not "chief angel," but "chief or ruler of the angels." Accordingly, same suppose that Christ himself is here meant, as to him alone, it is asserted, does this title belong; but the Lord and the archangel are here evidently distinguished. Others strangely imagine that the Holy Ghost is here meant. Others fix on the archangel Michael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a>). Christ is represented as accompanied by angels to the judgment; and it is futile to inquire who this leader of the angels is. <span class="cmt_word">And the trump of God</span>; even as the trumpet sounded at the giving of the Law from Sinai. Also the advent of Christ to judgment is represented as heralded by the sound of a trumpet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51, 52</a>). "We are to recognize three particulars, following each other in rapid succession - the commanding shout of the King himself, the voice of the archangel summoning the other angels, and the trump of God which awakens the dead and collects believers" (Riggen-bach). <span class="cmt_word">And the dead in Christ shall rise first.</span> Some suppose that the reference here is to the first resurrection; that the righteous, "the dead in Christ," shall rise before the wicked, "the dead not in Christ;" and that a thousand years, or the millennium, will intervene between the first and second resurrections (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4, 5</a>). But this is an entirely erroneous supposition. All that is here asserted is that the dead in Christ shall rise before the living in Christ shall be changed; there is no contrast between the dead in Christ and the dead not in Christ, nor any allusion to the resurrection of the wicked. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:13-18 Here is comfort for the relations and friends of those who die in the Lord. Grief for the death of friends is lawful; we may weep for our own loss, though it may be their gain. Christianity does not forbid, and grace does not do away, our natural affections. Yet we must not be excessive in our sorrows; this is too much like those who have no hope of a better life. Death is an unknown thing, and we know little about the state after death; yet the doctrines of the resurrection and the second coming of Christ, are a remedy against the fear of death, and undue sorrow for the death of our Christian friends; and of these doctrines we have full assurance. It will be some happiness that all the saints shall meet, and remain together for ever; but the principal happiness of heaven is to be with the Lord, to see him, live with him, and enjoy him for ever. We should support one another in times sorrow; not deaden one another's spirits, or weaken one another's hands. And this may be done by the many lessons to be learned from the resurrection of the dead, and the second coming of Christ. What! comfort a man by telling him he is going to appear before the judgment-seat of God! Who can feel comfort from those words? That man alone with whose spirit the Spirit of God bears witness that his sins are blotted out, and the thoughts of whose heart are purified by the Holy Spirit, so that he can love God, and worthily magnify his name. We are not in a safe state unless it is thus with us, or we are desiring to be so.</body></html>
