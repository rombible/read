"You need have no distress about your dead: when Christ comes, they will be there too; they will come with Him, and we shall be caught up to meet them."<p><span class= "bld">I would not have you to be ignorant.</span>--The right reading is <span class= "ital">we.</span> St. Paul is still speaking in the name of his companions as well as his own. The phrase is very weighty, and marks how lamentable such a piece of ignorance would be. (See references in the margin.)<p><span class= "bld">Which are asleep.</span>--The best reading is rather, <span class= "ital">which fall asleep; </span>the grief renewed itself over each successive death-bed. The image of <span class= "ital">sleep</span> is a mere metaphor, drawn from the outward <span class= "ital">phenomena</span> of death, and is used as an <span class= "ital">euphemism</span> for death; therefore no <span class= "ital">doctrine</span> can be deduced with precision from it. It cannot be said (for instance; on the strength of such passages alone, that only the <span class= "ital">body</span> sleeps, and not the soul; or, again, that the soul sleeps while the body remains in the grave. That the soul, or at any rate the <span class= "ital">spirit, </span>still retains consciousness after dissolution is clear from other places; but when the metaphor of sleep is used, it is used of the <span class= "ital">whole</span> man (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-11.htm" title="These things said he: and after that he said to them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.">John 11:11</a>, "<span class= "ital">Lazarus</span>"--not" Lazarus' body"--"sleepeth"), the explanation being either that stated above--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>that the word is simply <span class= "ital">picturesque, </span>describing the peaceful <span class= "ital">appearance</span> of the dead--or that the reference is to <span class= "ital">rest</span> from labour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-13.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from now on: Yes, said the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.">Revelation 14:13</a>). At the same time, the metaphor suggests (otherwise it would be misleading, and St. Paul would not have used it) a continued (even if partly unconscious) existence, and the possibility of a reawakening: Again, for the same reason--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>because the word is metaphorical, not doctrinal--it cannot be limited to the <span class= "ital">Christian</span> dead: when the writers need to mark specially the departed Christians they annex qualifying words, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm" title="For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.">1Thessalonians 4:14</a>. Of course, on the mention of "the dead," the Thessalonians will at once think of their own brethren departed, so that there is no ambiguity.<p><span class= "bld">That ye</span> <span class= "bld">sorrow not.</span>--The words express St. Paul's <span class= "ital">object</span> in wishing them to know the truth. He wants them <span class= "ital">not to sorrow at all</span> over the dead; sorrow is only fit for Gentiles who have no hope. He does not mean that they are not to sorrow <span class= "ital">to the same degree</span> as those outside the Church, but that to Christians, who <span class= "ital">have</span> a hope, and such a hope, death ought to have no sorrows. The Office of Burial in the Prayer-book is as joyous as the Eucharistic Office itself.<p><span class= "bld">Others.</span>--The Greek word is "the others, those who have no hope," and includes <span class= "ital">all</span> who were <span class= "ital">not</span> members of the Church: "That ye mourn not like the rest, which have no hope." The having no hope does not mean that there is no hope <span class= "ital">for</span> them, but that <span class= "ital">they</span> are not cheered by hope.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - With this verse the apostle proceeds to another subject, namely, to comfort those who were mourning the death of their friends. It would appear that the Thessalonians were in perplexity and distress concerning the fate of their deceased friends, fearing that these would miss those blessings which they expected Christ to confer at his advent. Their views of the time and nature of the advent and of the future state in general were confused. They expected that Christ would come immediately and establish his kingdom on earth; and consequently they feared that those who had died would be excluded from it. <span class="cmt_word">But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren</span>; a phrase often used by the apostle, when he makes a transition to new and important matters (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-1.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-1.htm">1 Corinthians 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Concerning them which are asleep</span>; or, <span class="accented">are fallen asleep.</span> The death of believers in the New Testament is frequently called "sleep." "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11</a>). Of Stephen it is said that "he fell asleep" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-60.htm">Acts 7:60</a>). "Many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-30.htm">1 Corinthians 11:30</a>). "Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-18.htm">1 Corinthians 15:18</a>). "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed" (l Corinthians 15:51). "He fell asleep" is a common epitaph on early Christian tombstones. It is to be observed that it is not of the dead generally that the apostle speaks, but of the dead in Christ, and especially of those members of the Thessalonian Church who had died. <span class="cmt_word">That ye sorrow not.</span> Some suppose that sorrow for our deceased friends is here utterly prohibited; inasmuch as if we had a firm belief in their blessedness we would rejoice and not mourn. But the sorrow here prohibited is a despairing and an unbelieving sorrow; we are forbidden to sorrow as those who have no hope, no belief in a blessed resurrection. The tears of Jesus at the tomb of Lazarus have authorized and sanctified Christian sorrow. "Paul," observes Calvin, "lifts up the minds of believers to a consideration of the resurrection, lest they should indulge excessive grief on occasion of the death of their relatives, for it were unseemly that there should be no difference between them and unbelievers, who put no end or measure to their grief, for this reason, that in death they recognize nothing but destruction. Those that abuse this testimony so as to establish among Christians stoical indifference, that is, an iron hardness, will find nothing of this nature in Paul's words." <span class="cmt_word">Even as others</span>; literally, as <span class="accented">the rest</span>; namely, the heathen. <span class="cmt_word">Which have no hope</span>; no hope of immortality beyond death, or no hope of the resurrection. The heathen, with very few exceptions, had no hope of a future life, and hence they mourned over the death of their friends as an irreparable loss. This disconsolate feeling is apparent in their writings (for examples, see Lunemann, Alford, and Jowett, <span class="accented">in loco</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:13-18 Here is comfort for the relations and friends of those who die in the Lord. Grief for the death of friends is lawful; we may weep for our own loss, though it may be their gain. Christianity does not forbid, and grace does not do away, our natural affections. Yet we must not be excessive in our sorrows; this is too much like those who have no hope of a better life. Death is an unknown thing, and we know little about the state after death; yet the doctrines of the resurrection and the second coming of Christ, are a remedy against the fear of death, and undue sorrow for the death of our Christian friends; and of these doctrines we have full assurance. It will be some happiness that all the saints shall meet, and remain together for ever; but the principal happiness of heaven is to be with the Lord, to see him, live with him, and enjoy him for ever. We should support one another in times sorrow; not deaden one another's spirits, or weaken one another's hands. And this may be done by the many lessons to be learned from the resurrection of the dead, and the second coming of Christ. What! comfort a man by telling him he is going to appear before the judgment-seat of God! Who can feel comfort from those words? That man alone with whose spirit the Spirit of God bears witness that his sins are blotted out, and the thoughts of whose heart are purified by the Holy Spirit, so that he can love God, and worthily magnify his name. We are not in a safe state unless it is thus with us, or we are desiring to be so.</body></html>
