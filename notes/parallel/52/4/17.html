The spiritualising of our natural bodies without death, as described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-50.htm" title="Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.">1Corinthians 15:50</a>, <span class= "ital">et seq., </span>will enable us to be "caught up" equally well with, and in company with (both of which thoughts are included in "together with"), the resurgent dead. "Clouds" and "air" will be support enough for material so immaterial. Theodoret says, "He showeth the greatness of the honour: as the Master Himself was taken up upon a shining cloud, so also they that have believed in Him." The absolute equality, then, of quick and dead is proved.<p><span class= "bld">To meet the Lord in the air.</span>--St. Chrysostom says:" When the King cometh into a city, they that are honourable proceed forth to meet him, but the guilty await their judge within." The phrase "in the air" certainly does not mean "heaven." The word "ai<span class= "ital">r"</span>) in itself properly signifies the lower, denser, grosser atmosphere, in which the powers of darkness reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a>); but here it is only used in contrast with the <span class= "ital">ground, </span>and means "on the way from Heaven whence He comes," of course not to <span class= "ital">dwell</span> there, but to accompany Him to His Judgment-seat on the earth.<p><span class= "bld">And so.</span>--Now that St. Paul has settled the question of disparity between the dead and the living, he does not think it necessary to describe what is immediately to follow; <span class= "ital">that, </span>the Thessalonians were sure to know (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-2.htm" title="Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.">Hebrews 6:2</a>): it only remains to say that having once rejoined the Lord, they would never be parted from Him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then we which are alive and remain</span>; or, <span class="accented">are left</span>; that is, the saints who shall then be found alive on the earth. The apostle classes himself among the living, because he was then alive. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be caught up.</span> The expression describes the irresistible power with which the saints shall be caught up, perhaps by the ministry of angels. <span class="cmt_word">Together with them</span>; with the dead in Christ who are raised. <span class="cmt_word">In the clouds</span>. Our Lord is described as coming to judgment in the clouds of heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>). According to the Old Testament representation, God is described as making the clouds his chariot (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To meet the Lord</span>; in his descent from heaven to earth. <span class="cmt_word">In the air</span>. Not that he shall fix his throne in the air, but that he passes through the air in his descent to the earth. <span class="cmt_word">And so shall we ever be with the Lord</span>; shall share a blessed eternity in the vision and participation of his glory. The apostle does not here describe the solemnities of the judgment; but stops at the meeting of Christ and his risen saints, because his object was to comfort the Thessalonians under bereavement. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:13-18 Here is comfort for the relations and friends of those who die in the Lord. Grief for the death of friends is lawful; we may weep for our own loss, though it may be their gain. Christianity does not forbid, and grace does not do away, our natural affections. Yet we must not be excessive in our sorrows; this is too much like those who have no hope of a better life. Death is an unknown thing, and we know little about the state after death; yet the doctrines of the resurrection and the second coming of Christ, are a remedy against the fear of death, and undue sorrow for the death of our Christian friends; and of these doctrines we have full assurance. It will be some happiness that all the saints shall meet, and remain together for ever; but the principal happiness of heaven is to be with the Lord, to see him, live with him, and enjoy him for ever. We should support one another in times sorrow; not deaden one another's spirits, or weaken one another's hands. And this may be done by the many lessons to be learned from the resurrection of the dead, and the second coming of Christ. What! comfort a man by telling him he is going to appear before the judgment-seat of God! Who can feel comfort from those words? That man alone with whose spirit the Spirit of God bears witness that his sins are blotted out, and the thoughts of whose heart are purified by the Holy Spirit, so that he can love God, and worthily magnify his name. We are not in a safe state unless it is thus with us, or we are desiring to be so.</body></html>
