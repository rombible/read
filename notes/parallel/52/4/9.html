"We are very glad to hear of so strong a Christian feeling of brotherhood among you, and think it almost unnecessary to say anything more to you about it; still your charity is hardly <span class= "ital">catholic</span> enough, nor have you exercised it with sufficient sobriety and thrift."<p><span class= "bld">Brotherly love.</span>--Not love of men at large, but of Christians in particular: in fact, pretty nearly what we call "Church feeling." It is the <span class= "ital">natural affection</span> of those who feel that they are children of the same Father and the same mother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-26.htm" title="But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.">Galatians 4:26</a>), members of the same "household of faith" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-10.htm" title="As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good to all men, especially to them who are of the household of faith.">Galatians 6:10</a>). In itself, it is not the most exalted of graces, being to some extent the outcome of community of interests; therefore St. Peter exhorts his readers to make it a means of obtaining the higher grace of <span class= "ital">charity</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-22.htm" title="Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:">1Peter 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-7.htm" title="And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.">2Peter 1:7</a>). St. Paul in this place does mean the sentiment rather than the practice, but has specially in view the exercise of liberality towards fellow-Christians. The feeling of community can only be known by acts that prove it.<p><span class= "bld">Ye need not.</span>--A sweet rhetorical figure, by which men are encouraged to the performance of a duty in which they are not perfect, by the praising of their imperfect attempts: a specimen of that "courtesy" which is a part of "brotherly love." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-8.htm" title="Finally, be you all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brothers, be pitiful, be courteous:">1Peter 3:8</a>.) "I" should be <span class= "ital">we, </span>or <span class= "ital">any.</span><p><span class= "bld">Ye yourselves.</span>--It seems as if St. Paul had intended at first to say, "For ye yourselves know without any instruction," but suddenly inserts the <span class= "ital">source</span> of their knowledge instead:" For ye yourselves are divinely taught already." This seems more natural to the context (though grammatically less easy) than to understand:" For ye yourselves (as well as we) are taught of God." (Comp., however, the references.) God's teaching here comes (though perhaps other modes are not excluded) by the direct contact with the indwelling Spirit. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-27.htm" title="But the anointing which you have received of him stays in you, and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him.">1John 2:27</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">To love.</span>--In the Greek this is not the simple infinitive after "taught;" it expresses rather the result and issue of God's teaching: "have been so schooled by God as to love one another." This love is not actually contrasted with the "brotherly kindness" above, but means more.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The apostle now proceeds to a new exhortation. <span class="cmt_word">But as touching brotherly love.</span> Brotherly love is the love of Christians to Christians, that special affection which believers bear to each other; a virtue which was carried to such perfection in the primitive Church as to call forth the admiration of their heathen adversaries. This virtue is often inculcated in Scripture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-1.htm">Hebrews 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-14.htm">1 John 3:14</a>), and is distinguished from love in general (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-7.htm">2 Peter 1:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye need not that I write unto you</span>; a delicate and gentle reproof. <span class="cmt_word">For ye yourselves are taught of God.</span> We are not here to think of the new commandment of brotherly love given by the Savior, nor on the Divine compassion exciting us to love; but "taught of God" by the influences of the Spirit on their hearts and consciences to love one another. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:9-12 We should notice in others what is good, to their praise, that we may engage them to abound therein more and more. All who are savingly taught of God, are taught to love one another. The teaching of the Spirit exceeds the teachings of men; and men's teaching is vain and useless, unless God teach. Those remarkable for this or any other grace, need to increase therein, as well as to persevere to the end. It is very desirable to have a calm and quiet temper, and to be of a peaceable and quiet behaviour. Satan is busy to trouble us; and we have in our hearts what disposes us to be unquiet; therefore let us study to be quiet. Those who are busy-bodies, meddling in other men's matters, have little quiet in their own minds, and cause great disturbances among their neighbours. They seldom mind the other exhortation, to be diligent in their own calling, to work with their own hands. Christianity does not take us from the work and duty of our particular callings, but teaches us to be diligent therein. People often by slothfulness reduce themselves to great straits, and are liable to many wants; while such as are diligent in their own business, earn their own bread, and have great pleasure in so doing.</body></html>
