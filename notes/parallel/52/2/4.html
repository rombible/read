St. Paul is arguing from his habitual practice. "But we speak after the manner of men who remember that God Himself has tried them, and has been satisfied to entrust the gospel to them, making it our business to please, not men, but God who thus tries our hearts" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/4-1.htm" title="Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.">1Corinthians 4:1-2</a>). The word translated "allowed" implies examining and approving (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-19.htm" title="And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray you have me excused.">Luke 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-10.htm" title="And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.">1Timothy 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-7.htm" title="That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be found to praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:">1Peter 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-1.htm" title="Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.">1John 4:1</a>), and is repeated emphatically (trans lated "trieth"): "being examined and approved by God, we study to please Him who constantly examines and approves us, not to court those to whom we are sent." St. Paul expresses here, as elsewhere, a total disregard of men's opinions about him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-3.htm" title="But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yes, I judge not my own self.">1Corinthians 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-10.htm" title="For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.">Galatians 1:10</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>; in contrast. <span class="cmt_word">As</span>; according as. <span class="cmt_word">We were allowed.</span> The old English for "approved." <span class="cmt_word">Of God</span>. The word rendered "allowed" signifies tried, tested as gold is tested in the fire, and hence also the result of that trial, "approved."

Not a general statement, "God who is the Discerner of the heart;" but "our hearts," namely, of us, the publishers of the gospel - Paul and Silas and Timothy; thus appealing to God, as the infallible Judge of their sincerity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-6 The apostle had no wordly design in his preaching. Suffering in a good cause should sharpen holy resolution. The gospel of Christ at first met with much opposition; and it was preached with contention, with striving in preaching, and against opposition. And as the matter of the apostle's exhortation was true and pure, the manner of his speaking was without guile. The gospel of Christ is designed for mortifying corrupt affections, and that men may be brought under the power of faith. This is the great motive to sincerity, to consider that God not only sees all we do, but knows our thoughts afar off, and searches the heart. And it is from this God who trieth our hearts, that we must receive our reward. The evidences of the apostle's sincerity were, that he avoided flattery and covetousness. He avoided ambition and vain-glory.</body></html>
