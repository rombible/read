If the word attaches itself to any particular phrase, it is to "impart our own souls," "we were ready to die for you; indeed, you remember how we worked ourselves almost to death."<p><span class= "bld">Labour and travail</span>--not mere synonyms here: the first describes the <span class= "ital">kind</span> of work; the second, the intensity of it: "our manual labour, and how hard we worked at that."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>; a proof or confirmation of this dearness of the Thessalonians to the apostle. <span class="cmt_word">Ye remember, brethren</span>; recalling to their recollection his conduct when he was with them. <span class="cmt_word">Our labor and travail</span>. These two terms frequently occur together (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-27.htm">2 Corinthians 11:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:8</a>), and can hardly be distinguished; "labor," or" toil," is active, denoting exertion; "travail" is passive, denoting weariness or fatigue, the effect of the exertion. <span class="cmt_word">For laboring</span>; in its strict meaning chiefly used of manual labor. Paul here refers to his working for his own support as a tent-maker. <span class="cmt_word">Night and day</span>. Night precedes according to the Jewish mode of reckoning. It does not denote that the apostle made up by labor at night the loss of time during the day which his higher duties, as a preacher of the gospel, occasioned; that he wrought at his trade at night, and preached during the (lay; but the phrase, "night and day," denotes incessantly, continually. <span class="cmt_word">Because we would not be chargeable to any of you.</span> Not a proof of the poverty of the Church of Thessalonica; but the reason of this unselfish conduct of the apostle was that no hindrance should arise on his part to the spread of the gospel; that no imputation of selfishness or covetousness should be laid to his charge. As he had done at Thessalonica so the apostle acted in other places. Thus at the time he was writing this Epistle he was working for his support at Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-12.htm">1 Corinthians 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-9.htm">2 Corinthians 11:9</a>). And such was also his practice at Ephesus; for in his farewell address to the Ephesian elders he could appeal to them: "Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-34.htm">Acts 20:34</a><span class="cmt_word">).

This is the way to win people. We should not only be faithful to our calling as Christians, but in our particular callings and relations. Our great gospel privilege is, that God has called us to his kingdom and glory. The great gospel duty is, that we walk worthy of God. We should live as becomes those called with such a high and holy calling. Our great business is to honour, serve, and please God, and to seek to be worthy of him.</body></html>
