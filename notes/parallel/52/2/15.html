Objection is often made to St. John's Gospel on the ground that no born Jew could have written of "the Jews" in the bitter way so common in that book, or viewed them so completely as a separate body from himself. This passage, in an indubitable epistle of "a Hebrew of the Hebrews." seems a satisfactory answer. The memories of St. Stephen's speech (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-52.htm" title="Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom you have been now the betrayers and murderers:">Acts 7:52</a>) seem to be waking in the mind of him who was once a persecuting Jew himself.<p><span class= "bld">Have persecuted.</span>--Take the marginal version, "chased" (not <span class= "ital">"have</span> chased") "us violently out of Thessalonica."<p><span class= "bld">They please</span> <span class= "bld">not God</span>--(though to serve and please Him was the special purpose for which the nation was set apart, ) "and are at cross purposes with all mankind." The historian Tacitus gives, as a characteristic of the race, "an attitude of hostility and hatred towards all others." Juvenal makes the same accusation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who both killed the Lord Jesus</span>; emphatic, to point out the greatness of their wickedness. <span class="cmt_word">And their own prophets</span>; or, as some manuscripts read, <span class="accented">and the prophets</span>. This crime was often laid to the charge of the Jews: thus, by our Lord, "Ye are witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-31.htm">Matthew 23:31</a>); and by the protomartyr Stephen, "Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-25.htm">Acts 7:25</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">And have persecuted us</span>; literally, <span class="accented">driven us out</span>, as Paul and Silos were expelled from Thessalonica. <span class="cmt_word">And they please not God, but are contrary to all men.</span> The hatred and contempt which the Jews bore to other nations is noticed by Tacitus, Juvenal, and other heathen writers. Thus Tacitus writes of them: "They are faithful to obstinacy, and merciful toward themselves, but toward all others are actuated by the most irreconcilable hatred (<span class="accented">odium humani generis</span>)." And Juvenal says, "They will not show the road to one who was not of their religion, nor lead the thirsty person if uncircumcised to the common spring." Perhaps, however, the apostle refers here, not to the enmity of the Jews to the human race in general, though perfectly cognizant of their bigotry and intolerance; as this enmity was a perversion of their peculiar distinction as he people of God; but rather to their opposition to his preaching the gospel to the Gentiles - to their extreme reluctance that the Gentiles along with themselves should be admitted into the kingdom of God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:13-16 We should receive the word of God with affections suitable to its holiness, wisdom, truth, and goodness. The words of men are frail and perishing, like themselves, and sometimes false, foolish, and fickle; but God's word is holy, wise, just, and faithful. Let us receive and regard it accordingly. The word wrought in them, to make them examples to others in faith and good works, and in patience under sufferings, and in trials for the sake of the gospel. Murder and persecution are hateful to God, and no zeal for any thing in religion can excuse it. Nothing tends more to any person or people's filling up the measure of their sins, than opposing the gospel, and hindering the salvation of souls. The pure gospel of Christ is abhorred by many, and the faithful preaching of it is hindered in many ways. But those who forbid the preaching it to sinners, to men dead in sin, do not by this please God. Those have cruel hearts, and are enemies to the glory of God, and to the salvation of his people, who deny them the Bible.</body></html>
