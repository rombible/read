St. Paul seems to mean that there may be a certain sum of wickedness which God will allow a nation, a church, a person, to complete, before cutting" them off from all spiritual help; the Jews were industriously labouring to complete the sum.<p><span class= "bld">For.</span>--The Greek word is <span class= "ital">but;</span> and the point is this:--"The Jews have been working up to the rounded perfection of their sin; but (they had not much left to do) the wrath burst suddenly upon them to its uttermost." The word for "is come" (which should be the simple preterite "came") is the same as that used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-28.htm" title="But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come to you.">Matthew 12:28</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-20.htm" title="But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come on you.">Luke 11:20</a>, of a sudden, unexpected apparition. "The wrath" is the wrath from which Jesus is delivering us (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm" title="And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.">1Thessalonians 1:10</a>), and it had already come upon the Jews, though its outward manifestation in the destruction of Jerusalem was not to come yet awhile. The particular moment at which St. Paul means that the wrath "came" must have been the moment of their final rejection of the Messiah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Forbidding us</span> - by contradicting, blaspheming, slandering, laying snares - <span class="cmt_word">to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved.</span> Not that the Jews were averse to the proselytism of the Gentiles, provided they were circumcised -rod kept the Law of Moses; on the contrary, Judaism at this period was a proselytizing religion; but their great objection to the preaching of the gospel was that the preachers did not insist on the Gentiles becoming Jews before they became Christians. And, accordingly, we learn from the Acts of the Apostles that the unbelieving Jews were the most violent and implacable enemies of the gospel. Of the numerous persecutions mentioned in the Acts, there were only two, namely, those at Philippi and Ephesus, which were not occasioned by the Jews. <span class="cmt_word">To fill up their sins always</span>; so that the measure of their iniquity became full to overflowing. Their forbidding the apostles to preach to the Gentiles was the last drop which caused the cup of their iniquity to overflow (cutup. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>, "The iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full"). The remark of Professor Jowett is well worthy of notice: "In the beginning of sin and evil it seems as if men were free agents, and had the power of going on or of retreating. But as the crisis of their fate approaches, they are bound under a curse and the form in which their destiny presents itself to our minds is as though it were certain, and only a question of time how soon it is to be fulfilled." <span class="cmt_word">For the wrath</span>; that wrath which was predicted and is merited by them. "Wrath" is here used for punishment, which is the effect of wrath. <span class="cmt_word">Is come upon them to the uttermost</span>; literally, <span class="accented">to the end</span>. The apostle here refers to the judgments of God, which were impending on Jerusalem and the Jewish people; judgments which were fearfully executed in the awful sufferings they endured in the Jewish war, and in the destruction of their city by the Romans. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:13-16 We should receive the word of God with affections suitable to its holiness, wisdom, truth, and goodness. The words of men are frail and perishing, like themselves, and sometimes false, foolish, and fickle; but God's word is holy, wise, just, and faithful. Let us receive and regard it accordingly. The word wrought in them, to make them examples to others in faith and good works, and in patience under sufferings, and in trials for the sake of the gospel. Murder and persecution are hateful to God, and no zeal for any thing in religion can excuse it. Nothing tends more to any person or people's filling up the measure of their sins, than opposing the gospel, and hindering the salvation of souls. The pure gospel of Christ is abhorred by many, and the faithful preaching of it is hindered in many ways. But those who forbid the preaching it to sinners, to men dead in sin, do not by this please God. Those have cruel hearts, and are enemies to the glory of God, and to the salvation of his people, who deny them the Bible.</body></html>
