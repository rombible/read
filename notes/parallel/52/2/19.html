The apostle calls the Thessalonians his "hope," not because he anticipates any reward from their conversion, or because their conversion would counterbalance his former persecution of the Christians, but because he hoped to meet them in glory; he calls them his "joy," because he would rejoice with them in their final salvation; and he calls them his "crown of rejoicing," because he regards them as trophies of the victory of the gospel which he preached. Similarly he calls the Philippians "his joy and crown" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-1.htm">Philippians 4:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Are not even ye</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">are not ye also?</span> - ye as well as other Christians? <span class="cmt_word">In the presence of</span> - before - <span class="cmt_word">our Lord Jesus</span> <span class="cmt_word">Christ at his coming</span>; at the restoration of his Messianic kingdom. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:17-20 This world is not a place where we are to be always, or long together. In heaven holy souls shall meet, and never part more. And though the apostle could not come to them yet, and thought he might never be able to come, yet our Lord Jesus Christ will come; nothing shall hinder that. May God give faithful ministers to all who serve him with their spirit in the gospel of his Son, and send them to all who are in darkness</body></html>
