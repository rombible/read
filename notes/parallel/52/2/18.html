Why had they not? The answer shows the minute truthfulness of the Acts. Timothy, apparently, did not at first <span class= "ital">leave</span> Thessalonica with St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-10.htm" title="And the brothers immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.">Acts 17:10</a>, where the Greek seems definitely to exclude him). Both Silas and Timothy were left at Ber?a (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-14.htm" title="And then immediately the brothers sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus stayed there still.">Acts 17:14</a>). It was during this period that St. Paul felt so eager a desire to return to his persecuted children. We cannot tell on what two definite occasions the desire was almost taking shape; but possibly his longing may have been stimulated by seeing his messengers start for the north, first when he sent for his two companions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-15.htm" title="And they that conducted Paul brought him to Athens: and receiving a commandment to Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.">Acts 17:15</a>), and secondly when he despatched Timothy himself to Thessalonica (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm" title="And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:">1Thessalonians 3:2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">But Satan hindered.</span>--How, cannot be decided; but St. Paul has no doubt that his disappointment was a direct manifestation of the work of evil, not a leading of God to stay where he was. Elsewhere he is quite as clear that the obstruction of his own plans is owing to God. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/16-6.htm" title="Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,">Acts 16:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-12.htm" title="As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come to you with the brothers: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.">1Corinthians 16:12</a>, where the will spoken of is not Apollos' will, but God's.) The difficulty is to tell in each case whether God is directly saving us from a worse course, in spite of ourselves, or permitting a momentary, and yet if rightly used a disciplinary, triumph of evil.<p><span class= "bld">Satan.</span>--The Thessalonians, though originally Gentiles, had doubtless been taught enough at their conversion to recognise the word. Though it is quite clear from other passages (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-5.htm" title="Defraud you not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.">1Corinthians 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,">2Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-7.htm" title="Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.">1Timothy 3:7</a>) that St. Paul believed in the existence of personal fallen spirits, it cannot be positively affirmed that he <span class= "ital">here</span> means anything more than a <span class= "ital">personification</span> of all that is opposed to God--the hostility of wicked men, &c.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul</span>. Paul distinguishes himself, because in all probability his companions, Silas and Timothy, had been at Thessalonica after he had left it. <span class="cmt_word">Once and again.</span> Not used indefinitely, but referring to two separate attempts which Paul made to revisit the Thessalonians. <span class="cmt_word">But Satan hindered us</span>; denoting, not the enemies of Christianity, but the devil, the author of all the hindrances in the kingdom of God. Paul here recognizes the personality of Satan, as the author of all evil, the great opponent of God and Christ. We are not informed by what instrumentality this hindrance of Satan took place. It may refer to the various persecutions against Paul, which prevented him returning to Thessalonica, and especially to that persecution raised against him in Beraea by the Jews of Thessalonica (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-13.htm">Acts 17:13</a>). In one sense, indeed, the hindrances arose in the way of God's providence, for under its direction all the journeys of Paul were placed, and Satan could not have hindered him from preaching the gospel in any quarter, unless by the Divine permission (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-7.htm">Acts 16:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:17-20 This world is not a place where we are to be always, or long together. In heaven holy souls shall meet, and never part more. And though the apostle could not come to them yet, and thought he might never be able to come, yet our Lord Jesus Christ will come; nothing shall hinder that. May God give faithful ministers to all who serve him with their spirit in the gospel of his Son, and send them to all who are in darkness</body></html>
