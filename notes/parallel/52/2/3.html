"<span class= "ital">Our</span> efforts to get men to act as we wish," St. Paul says, "do not spring from a desire to dupe them," etc. It is a question whether "of deceit" is the right rendering, or "of error," "all a mistake." If the latter, the argument would be that of Paley's <span class= "ital">Evidences, i.e., </span>to deduce the truth of the revelation from the sufferings of its prophets. But the points raised in contrast, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which tries our hearts.">1Thessalonians 2:4-12</a>, seem to preclude this meaning, which would be more likely to introduce some substantiation of the gospel truths, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-16.htm" title="For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.">2Peter 1:16</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Of uncleanness.</span>--It is possible that the word only means "with impure (or <span class= "ital">covetous</span>) motives;" but it probably refers to the subtle forms of temptation which often accompany spiritual work. See, for example, the Greek of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-5.htm" title="Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:">1Timothy 1:5</a>; also 5:1, 2; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/3-4.htm" title="Traitors, heady, high minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;">2Timothy 3:4-7</a>.<p><span class= "bld">In guile.</span>--The preposition is changed;" nor yet by the use of tricks;" Not only were their motives sincere and pure, but their manner of dealing straightforward.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For our exhortation.</span> This word has a twofold signification, denoting both "exhortation" and "consolation;" when it refers to the moral conduct it denotes exhortation, but when it is an address to a sufferer it denotes consolation. In the gospel these two meanings are blended together. <span class="cmt_word">Was not of deceit.</span> Not in the sense of guile, which would be tantological, but simply "<span class="accented">error</span>," without any direct evil intent; our gospel was not a delusion - we were not ourselves deceived. <span class="cmt_word">Nor of uncleanness</span>; a word usually employed to denote sensuality, and in this sense the meaning is - We did not, like the heathen in their worship, give occasion to unclean practices: "<span class="accented">We</span> have corrupted no man" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-2.htm">2 Corinthians 7:2</a>). The word, however, may be taken in a more general sense, as denoting impurity of disposition, impure motives: such as the impure desire of applause or of gain, to which the apostle afterwards alludes<span class="cmt_word">. Or of guile.</span> As we were not ourselves deceived, so neither did we attempt to deceive others. The apostle did not adapt his religion, an. Mahomet, to suit the prejudices or passions of men; he did not employ any seductive or temporizing arts; but he boldly went in the face of the prevailing religions of the age, both of the Jews and of the Gentiles. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-6 The apostle had no wordly design in his preaching. Suffering in a good cause should sharpen holy resolution. The gospel of Christ at first met with much opposition; and it was preached with contention, with striving in preaching, and against opposition. And as the matter of the apostle's exhortation was true and pure, the manner of his speaking was without guile. The gospel of Christ is designed for mortifying corrupt affections, and that men may be brought under the power of faith. This is the great motive to sincerity, to consider that God not only sees all we do, but knows our thoughts afar off, and searches the heart. And it is from this God who trieth our hearts, that we must receive our reward. The evidences of the apostle's sincerity were, that he avoided flattery and covetousness. He avoided ambition and vain-glory.</body></html>
