From this point (roughly speaking) to the end of 1 Thessalonians 3, the action of the <span class= "ital">converts</span> is the chief subject.<p>This verse differs from the original in several particulars of more or less importance. Literally translated, it would run thus: <span class= "ital">And for this cause we too thank God unceasingly, that, on receiving a word of hearing at our lips of God, ye welcomed, not a word of men, but </span>(<span class= "ital">as it is in truth</span>)<span class= "ital"> a word of God, which also, </span>etc.<p><span class= "bld">For this cause</span>--viz., because of the labours we went through to teach you, which we are thankful were not wasted. <span class= "ital">We too, </span>as well as you. The two words rendered "received" are not the same; the first meaning merely an outward reception, the second the welcome given. The words "it" and "as" (as the italics show) do not stand in the Greek. St. Paul is not expressing so much his gratitude for the manner in which the word was greeted, as for the essential character of what was greeted.<p><span class= "bld">The word of God which ye heard of us.</span>--The same phrase as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-2.htm" title="For to us was the gospel preached, as well as to them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.">Hebrews 4:2</a>, which is there rendered, "the word preached." "The word might have been, so far as you knew, a mere <span class= "ital">word spoken by us</span>--ordinary men--but it was in reality a word of God, and so you found when you embraced it."<p><span class= "bld">You that believe.</span>--It could have no effect without this condition. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-2.htm" title="For to us was the gospel preached, as well as to them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.">Hebrews 4:2</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this cause.</span> Not because God has called you to his kingdom and glory, but, referring to what follows, because of your reception of' the gospel. <span class="cmt_word">We thank God.</span> Although the reception of the gospel was in one sense the free and voluntary act on the part of the Thessalonians; yet in another sense it was the act of God who ordained them to accept the gospel; their belief was an operation of God in them. <span class="cmt_word">Without ceasing, because, when ye received the Word of God which ye heard of us</span>; literally, <span class="accented">because when ye receive, d from us the</span> Word <span class="accented">of hearing, which is of God</span>. The gospel is called "the Word of hearing," because it came by hearing; hence "the Word heard," or "the Word of the message" (R.V.). It is further designated "of God" - the Word whose Author is God. <span class="cmt_word">Ye received it not as the word of men</span> - as if it were of human origin - <span class="cmt_word">but as it is in truth, the Word of God</span> - of Divine origin - <span class="cmt_word">which effectually worketh</span>. The pronoun may refer to God, "who effectually worketh," or better to the Word of God, as the principal subject of the sentence. <span class="cmt_word">Also in you that believe.</span> The gospel was powerful as respects the preachers, and effectual as respects the hearers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:13-16 We should receive the word of God with affections suitable to its holiness, wisdom, truth, and goodness. The words of men are frail and perishing, like themselves, and sometimes false, foolish, and fickle; but God's word is holy, wise, just, and faithful. Let us receive and regard it accordingly. The word wrought in them, to make them examples to others in faith and good works, and in patience under sufferings, and in trials for the sake of the gospel. Murder and persecution are hateful to God, and no zeal for any thing in religion can excuse it. Nothing tends more to any person or people's filling up the measure of their sins, than opposing the gospel, and hindering the salvation of souls. The pure gospel of Christ is abhorred by many, and the faithful preaching of it is hindered in many ways. But those who forbid the preaching it to sinners, to men dead in sin, do not by this please God. Those have cruel hearts, and are enemies to the glory of God, and to the salvation of his people, who deny them the Bible.</body></html>
