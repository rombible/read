No fleshly relationship existed between the two, but a closer and far dearer connection. St. Paul had taken him while yet a very young man to be his companion and fellow-labourer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-3.htm" title="Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.">Acts 16:3</a>). He told the Philippian Church he had no one like-minded (with Timothy) who would care for their affairs. He wrote to the Corinthians how Timothy was his beloved and faithful son in the Lord, who would put them in remembrance of his ways in Christ.<p><span class= "bld">Mercy.</span>--Between the usual salutation "grace and peace," in these Pastoral Epistles, he introduces "mercy." The nearness of death, the weakness of old age, the dangers, ever increasing, which crowded round Paul, seem to have called forth from him deeper expressions of love and tender pity. Jesus Christ, his "hope," burned before him, a guiding star her brighter and clearer; and the "mercy" of God, which the old man felt he had obtained, he longed to share with others.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="accented">My true child in faith</span> for <span class="accented">my own son in the faith</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">peace</span> for <span class="accented">and peace</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the Father</span> for <span class="accented">our Father</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">Christ Jesus</span> for <span class="accented">Jesus Christ</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">My true child in faith.</span> A most awkward phrase, which can only mean that Timothy was St. Paul's true child because his faith was equal to St. Paul's, which is not St. Paul's meaning. Timothy was St. Paul's own son, because he had begotten him in the gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-14.htm">1 Corinthians 4:14-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-10.htm">Philemon 1:10</a>) - his spiritual son. This is best expressed as in the A.V. by "in the faith" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a>, where the same idea is expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Grace, mercy, and peace.</span> This varies from the blessing at the beginning of the Epistles to the Romans, Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Thessalonians, by the addition of the word "mercy," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-2.htm">2 Timothy 1:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a> in the T.R., and also in 2 John 3 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-2.htm">Jude 1:2</a>. It seems in St. Paul to connect itself with that deeper sense of the need and of the enjoyment of mercy which went with his deepening sense of sin as he drew towards his end, and harmonizes beautifully with what he says in vers. 12-16. The analogy of the other forms of blessing quoted above strongly favors the sense <span class="cmt_word">our Father</span> rather than <span class="accented">the Father</span>. Whether we read <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> with the T.R. or omit it with the R.T., the idea of <span class="accented">Father</span> is contrasted, not with that of <span class="accented">Son</span>, but with that of <span class="accented">Lord</span>; the two words express the relation of the Persons of the Godhead, not to each other, but to the Church. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-4 Jesus Christ is a Christian's hope; all our hopes of eternal life are built upon him; and Christ is in us the hope of glory. The apostle seems to have been the means of Timothy's conversion; who served with him in his ministry, as a dutiful son with a loving father. That which raises questions, is not for edifying; that which gives occasion for doubtful disputes, pulls down the church rather than builds it up. Godliness of heart and life can only be kept up and increased, by the exercise of faith in the truths and promises of God, through Jesus Christ.</body></html>
