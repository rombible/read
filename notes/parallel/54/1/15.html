These things are good and profitable to men.">Titus 3:8</a>; and the somewhat similar expression, "these sayings [<span class= "ital">words'</span>] are faithful and true," <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-5.htm" title="And he that sat on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said to me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.">Revelation 21:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-6.htm" title="And he said to me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show to his servants the things which must shortly be done.">Revelation 22:6</a>, were formulas expressing weighty and memorable truths, well known and often repeated by the brotherhood of Christians in the first ages of the faith. They were, no doubt, rehearsed constantly in the assemblies, till they became well-known watchwords in the various churches scattered over the Mediterranean-washed provinces of the Roman empire; and in these "sayings" we see, perhaps, the germs of the great creeds of Christianity. [<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-1.htm" title="This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desires a good work.">1Timothy 3:1</a>, perhaps, as usually understood, hardly falls under this category of "watchwords of the faith," unless St. Chrysostom's interpretation of the text be followed, which refers "the faithful saying" to the solemn truths which immediately preceded it in 1 Timothy 2]<p><span class= "bld">That Christ Jesus came into the world.</span>--This is an unmistakable allusion to the pre-existence of Christ. He came into the world, leaving the glory which he had with the Father before the world was (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-28.htm" title="I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.">John 16:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:">Ephesians 1:3-4</a>). And the purpose for which he came into the world is stated distinctly in the next sentence.<p><span class= "bld">To save sinners.</span>--There are no details given respecting this salvation. The "sinners" here mentioned is a broad, inclusive term. It includes, besides Jews, the outcasts of the Gentiles without hope and without God--<span class= "ital">all the lost, </span>irrespective of race or time. In the Lord's own blessed words: "The Son of Man was come to seek and to save that which was lost" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-10.htm" title="For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.">Luke 19:10</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Of whom I am chief.</span>--The intense humility of the strange, beautiful character of the Gentile Apostle prompted this bitter expression. St. Paul, it has been well said, knew his own sins by experience, and every other man's <span class= "ital">per speculationem. In</span> another place a similar feeling leads him to style himself as "less than the least of all saints" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm" title="To me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;">Ephesians 3:8</a>). He had been in time past so bitter an enemy of the Lord that no preaching of the disciples was effectual to work his conversion. In his case, to overcome his intense hatred of the Name, it needed a special appearance of the Risen One.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="accented">Faithful is the saying</span> for <span class="accented">this is a faithful saying</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Faithful is the saying</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). This formula is peculiar to the pastoral Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-1.htm">1 Timothy 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-9.htm">1 Timothy 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-11.htm">2 Timothy 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-8.htm">Titus 3:8</a>), and seems to indicate that there were a number of pithy sayings, maxims, portions of hymns or of catechetical teaching, current in the Church, and possibly originating in the inspired sayings of the Church prophets, to which the apostle appeals, and to which he gives his sanction. The one appealed to here would be simply, "<span class="accented">Jesus</span> Christ came into the world to save sinners." This, St. Paul adds, is worthy of all acceptation - by all, and without any reserve. <span class="cmt_word">Acceptation</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>); only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-9.htm">1 Timothy 4:9</a>, in connection with the same formula. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-40.htm">Luke 8:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-4.htm">Acts 15:4</a>; 18:29; 24:3; 28:30. It contains the idea of a glad, willing acceptance (see note on Acts 2:41). So doubtless <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> also means "hearty reception." <span class="cmt_word">I am chief</span>; in respect of his having been" a blasphemer, a persecutor, and injurious." That great sin was indeed freely forgiven by God's grace, but it could never be forgotten by him who had been guilty of it. "Manet alta mente repostum" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-17 The apostle knew that he would justly have perished, if the Lord had been extreme to mark what was amiss; and also if his grace and mercy had not been abundant to him when dead in sin, working faith and love to Christ in his heart. This is a faithful saying; these are true and faithful words, which may be depended on, That the Son of God came into the world, willingly and purposely to save sinners. No man, with Paul's example before him, can question the love and power of Christ to save him, if he really desires to trust in him as the Son of God, who once died on the cross, and now reigns upon the throne of glory, to save all that come to God through him. Let us then admire and praise the grace of God our Saviour; and ascribe to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, three Persons in the unity of the Godhead, the glory of all done in, by, and for us.</body></html>
