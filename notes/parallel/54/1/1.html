It was an affectionate reminder from his old master, "Paul the Aged," to his disciple to be steadfast in the midst of the many perils to which one in the position of Timothy would be exposed in the city of Ephesus; but it was also an official command to resist a powerful school of false teaching which had arisen in the midst of that Ephesian Church over which Timothy was then presiding. So St. Paul prefaces his letter by designating himself an Apostle according to the commandment of God. The commandment especially referred to is to be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-2.htm" title="As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.">Acts 13:2</a> : Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.<p><span class= "bld">God our Saviour.</span>--This, designation is peculiar to the Pastoral Epistles, but frequently occurs in the Septuagint. It is fitly ascribed to the first Person of the blessed Trinity in reference to His redeeming love in Christ.<p><span class= "bld">Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope.</span>--The words "which is," printed in italics in the English version, are better left out: <span class= "ital">Jesus Christ, our hope.</span> As St. Paul felt the end of his course approaching, he loved to dwell on the thought of Jesus--to whom, during so many weary years, he had longed to depart and be with--as his hope, <span class= "ital">his one glorious hope.</span> The same expression is found in the <span class= "ital">Epistles</span> of Ignatius.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="accented">Christ Jesus</span> for <span class="accented">Jesus Christ</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">according to</span> for <span class="accented">by</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Christ Jesus our hope</span> for <span class="accented">Lord Jesus Christ</span>, <span class="accented">which is our hope</span>, A.V. and T.R.

The apostle seems to have been the means of Timothy's conversion; who served with him in his ministry, as a dutiful son with a loving father. That which raises questions, is not for edifying; that which gives occasion for doubtful disputes, pulls down the church rather than builds it up. Godliness of heart and life can only be kept up and increased, by the exercise of faith in the truths and promises of God, through Jesus Christ.</body></html>
