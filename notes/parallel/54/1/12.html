With or without this word, the sense is much the same; for on the words, "the gospel . . . committed to my trust," the Apostle pauses, overwhelmed with the flood of grateful memories which such a thought let loose. "How I thank God," wrote St. Paul, "who hath strengthened me within, with this power to bear witness to my Master!--<span class= "ital">me</span> of all persons, who was once a blasphemer of His royal name! What an example I--your teacher, the founder of this Church of Ephesus--am of the transforming grace of the gospel--of its sweet, mighty power to forgive sins." It was the thought of the great love, passing understanding, of the tender, pitiful mercy which suffered so wondrous a trust to be committed to the charge of such a sinner, that called forth the ejaculation of deep thankfulness we read in the twelfth and following verses.<p>If we ask more particularly respecting the exact way in which Jesus Christ "enabled," or "strengthened St. Paul within," we must think of his strange power of winning men to his Master's side; we must remember his miraculous gifts over disease and even death; and last, but not least, that strength of endurance, that brave, sweet patience which made his life of suffering borne for Christ so beautiful, so touching, an example for men.<p><span class= "bld">For that he counted me faithful.</span>--The All. seeing, knowing from the beginning that St. Paul would continue steadfast and true, selected him as "His chosen vessel" to bear His name and the glad news of His salvation into many lands.<p>It is observable, however, that <span class= "ital">this very faithfulness, this unflinching steadfastness, </span>which seems to have been the reason why the Lord chose him for his great work, St. Paul, in a well-known and remarkable passage, refers to as a gift of grace which he had obtained in mercy of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-25.htm" title="Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.">1Corinthians 7:25</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">thank</span> for <span class="accented">and I thank</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">him that enabled me</span>, <span class="accented">even Christ Jesus our Lord</span> for <span class="accented">Christ Jesus our Lord</span>, <span class="accented">who hath enabled me</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">appointing me to his service</span> for <span class="accented">putting me into the ministry</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">I thank</span>, etc. This outburst of praise for the mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ, who had called him to the ministry of the Word, is caused by the thought, which immediately precedes, of his being entrusted with the gospel. He thus disclaims any notion of merit on his part. <span class="cmt_word">That enabled me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>). This verb occurs once in the Acts (Acts 9:22); three times in St. Paul's other Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-20.htm">Romans 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>); three times in the pastoral Epistles (here; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-1.htm">2 Timothy 2:1</a> and 2 Tim 4:17); and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-31.htm">Hebrews 11:31</a>. It denotes the giving that peculiar power which was the gift of the Holy Ghost, and which was necessary for the work of an apostle to enable him to bear witness to Christ in the face of an adverse world. This power (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) Christ promised to his apostles before his ascension (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). St Paul received it after his conversion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-22.htm">Acts 9:22</a>). He continued to hold it throughout his apostleship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>); he enjoyed it especially at the approach of his martyrdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a>). It comprised strength of faith, strength to testify and to preach, strength to endure and suffer. St. Paul's whole course is the best illustration of the nature of the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> which Christ gave him (see in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a> the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, and the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> all brought together as here). <span class="cmt_word">Appointing me to his service.</span> The A.V., <span class="accented">putting me into the ministry</span>, is a better rendering, because" the ministry" exactly expresses the particular kind of service to which the Lord appointed him (see the exactly parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-7.htm">Ephesians 3:7</a>). The absence of the article is unimportant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-7.htm">Romans 12:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-15.htm">1 Corinthians 16:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>). (For the general phrase, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>; or, still more exactly as regards the grammar, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:9</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-17 The apostle knew that he would justly have perished, if the Lord had been extreme to mark what was amiss; and also if his grace and mercy had not been abundant to him when dead in sin, working faith and love to Christ in his heart. This is a faithful saying; these are true and faithful words, which may be depended on, That the Son of God came into the world, willingly and purposely to save sinners. No man, with Paul's example before him, can question the love and power of Christ to save him, if he really desires to trust in him as the Son of God, who once died on the cross, and now reigns upon the throne of glory, to save all that come to God through him. Let us then admire and praise the grace of God our Saviour; and ascribe to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, three Persons in the unity of the Godhead, the glory of all done in, by, and for us.</body></html>
