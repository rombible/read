"Commandment" may be paraphrased in this place by "practical teaching."<p>With the false teachers' sickly "fables," which only led to disputing, St. Paul contrasts that "healthy practical teaching," the end and aim of which was love, or charity.<p><span class= "bld">Charity.</span>--That love, or broad, comprehensive charity, towards men, so nobly described in 1 Corinthians 13.<p><span class= "bld">Out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned.</span>--This broad all-embracing love, or charity, emanates only from "a pure heart:" <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, a heart free from selfish desires and evil passions. The "pure in heart" alone, said the Lord, in the sermon on the mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-8.htm" title="Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.">Matthew 5:8</a>), shall enjoy the beatific vision of God.<p><span class= "bld">And of a good conscience.</span>--This "charity" must also spring from a conscience unburthened of its load of guilt, from a conscience sprinkled with the precious blood, and so reconciled to God.<p><span class= "bld">And of faith unfeigned.</span>--And, lastly, the root of this "charity"--the end and aim of the practical teaching of the gospel preached by the Apostles--must be sought in "a faith unfeigned," in a faith that consists in something more than in a few high-sounding words, which lay claim to a sure confidence that is not felt. The "unfeigned faith" of St. Paul is a faith rich in works rather than in words.<p>Without this faith, so real that its fruits are ever manifest, there can be no good conscience; without this conscience, washed by the precious blood, there can be no pure heart.<p>The error of the teachers of whom Timothy was warned, we see from the next verse, consisted not so much in false doctrines as in an utter neglect of inculcating the necessity of a pure, self-denying life. They preferred curious questions and speculative inquiries to the grave, simple gospel teaching which led men to live an earnest, loving life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="accented">But</span> for <span class="accented">now</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">charge</span> for <span class="accented">commandment</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">love</span> for <span class="accented">charity</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a good</span> for <span class="accented">of a good</span>, and <span class="accented">faith</span> for <span class="accented">of faith</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">But the end of the charge.</span> Before proceeding with his sentence, in which he was about solemnly to commit the trust of the episcopate of the Church of Ephesus to Timothy, he breaks off abruptly to show the beneficent character of the charge, viz. the furtherance of that brotherly love and purity of heart and life which are the true fruit of the gospel dispensation, but which some, by their false doctrine, were so ruthlessly impeding. Each of these phrases, "a pure heart" and "a good conscience" and "faith unfeigned," seems to rebuke by contrast the merely <span class="accented">ceremonial cleanness</span> and the <span class="accented">defiled conscience</span> and the merely <span class="accented">nominal Christianity</span> of these heretical Judaizers (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-10.htm">Titus 1:10-16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:5-11 Whatever tends to weaken love to God, or love to the brethren, tends to defeat the end of the commandment. The design of the gospel is answered, when sinners, through repentance towards God and faith in Jesus Christ, are brought to exercise Christian love. And as believers were righteous persons in God's appointed way, the law was not against them. But unless we are made righteous by faith in Christ, really repenting and forsaking sin, we are yet under the curse of the law, even according to the gospel of the blessed God, and are unfit to share the holy happiness of heaven.</body></html>
