The <span class= "ital">object</span> of his intense hatred and of his burning antagonism during these never-to-be-forgotten days was <span class= "ital">that very Lord, </span>from whom later he had received such unspeakable gifts. He knew he had been "a blasphemer" of that dear Master in the truest sense of the terrible word, since, as it has been well said, that: "He who had seen Stephen die for Christ, and after this did not cease to pant like a wild beast for the blood of the Church, must have known that he had not been guilty of simply reviling men but of blaspheming God." And "a persecutor," for, to quote his own words at Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-4.htm" title="And I persecuted this way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.">Acts 22:4</a>): "I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women." (Comp., too, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-11.htm" title="For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me to them. I appeal to Caesar.">Acts 25:11</a> : "I compelled them to blaspheme.") And "injurious" (or, more accurately rendered, <span class= "ital">a doer of outrage</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>as he must well have remembered the events referred to in the history of the Acts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-1.htm" title="And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,">Acts 9:1</a>) in the words: "Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord."<p><span class= "bld">But I obtained mercy.</span>--The Apostle, his heart overflowing with love and gratitude, contrasts his Master's mercy with his own want of it; the "mercy" shown to him consisting in something very different to simple forgiveness of a great wrong. In St. Paul's case the pardon was crowned by many a noble gift bestowed by that pitiful King whom he had so cruelly wronged.<p><span class= "bld">Because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</span>--This is one of the passages which throws a gleam of light on some of the hard questions which perplex us when we meditate on the principles of the final judgment. Very little is told us as to the doom of those who have not heard, or else have failed to understand, the message of Christ. Still, from even such scanty teaching as is contained in the words we are now considering, and in such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-31.htm" title="Why I say to you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven to men.">Matthew 12:31-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-34.htm" title="Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.">Luke 23:34</a>, we gather that there is an ignorance which at least greatly modifies the guilt of unbelief; we learn at least this much--<span class= "ital">such a sinner is not out of the pale of the operation of divine mercy</span> But in spite of these hints--for they are little more--of the almost limitless area of the divine mercy, great care must be taken not to press overmuch these blessed intimations of the <span class= "ital">possibility</span> of a mercy far more extended than the usual interpretation of the inspired utterances would lead us to expect; for, after all, the words and teaching of the merciful Redeemer Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-48.htm" title="But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For to whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.">Luke 12:48</a>) seem to point to a mitigation of punishment, rather than to a complete forgiveness, of sins committed under circumstances of perhaps partial ignorance.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, both in the New Testament and in classical Greek, means to "treat or use others despitefully," "to outrage and insult" them, not without personal violence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-6.htm">Matthew 22:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-32.htm">Luke 18:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-5.htm">Acts 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a>).

This is a faithful saying; these are true and faithful words, which may be depended on, That the Son of God came into the world, willingly and purposely to save sinners. No man, with Paul's example before him, can question the love and power of Christ to save him, if he really desires to trust in him as the Son of God, who once died on the cross, and now reigns upon the throne of glory, to save all that come to God through him. Let us then admire and praise the grace of God our Saviour; and ascribe to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, three Persons in the unity of the Godhead, the glory of all done in, by, and for us.</body></html>
