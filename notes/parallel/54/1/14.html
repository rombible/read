The Greek word translated "was exceeding abundant" is very rare, and possesses a superlative force.<p><span class= "bld">With faith and love.</span>--He sums up the divine mercy showed to him in the three words: grace, faith, and love. Grace, the unspeakable gift of God to him; faith and love, the results of the exceeding abundant gift of grace.<p>Faith: not merely a childlike trust in Christ, but a belief which accepted Christ as the hope of an otherwise hopeless world; and love, which includes love to man as well as love to God, a strange contrast to his former cruelty and hatred; for, instead of blaspheming, <span class= "ital">now</span> he believed on Him whom he once reviled, and instead of persecuting the followers of Jesus, <span class= "ital">now, </span>in his great love for them, he spent himself. Then, overwhelmed with joy and thankfulness that he, the enemy of God, had obtained the mercy and love of God, and conscious, from his own sweet and bitter experiences, what that mercy of God bestowed on a sinner signified, he gave utterance to one of those bright watchwords of the faith, with which the Christians of the first days used to comfort and encourage one another, and which, perhaps, better than any other words, gave expression to the burning thoughts which rose up from his grateful heart.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="accented">Abounded exceedingly</span> for <span class="accented">was exceeding abundant</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Abounded exceedingly</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>); only here in the New Testament or elsewhere except "in Psalterio Salomonis <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5.htm">Psalm 5</a>:19, et in fragmento Hermae ap.

This is a faithful saying; these are true and faithful words, which may be depended on, That the Son of God came into the world, willingly and purposely to save sinners. No man, with Paul's example before him, can question the love and power of Christ to save him, if he really desires to trust in him as the Son of God, who once died on the cross, and now reigns upon the throne of glory, to save all that come to God through him. Let us then admire and praise the grace of God our Saviour; and ascribe to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, three Persons in the unity of the Godhead, the glory of all done in, by, and for us.</body></html>
