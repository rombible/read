The false teachers who are disturbing the Church at Ephesus are not named. There is, perhaps, a ring of contempt in the expression "some," but it seems more probable that the names were designedly omitted in this letter, which was intended to be a public document. The chief superintendent of the Ephesian community, doubtless, knew too well who were the mistaken men referred to.<p><span class= "bld">That they teach no other doctrine.</span>--"Other"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>other than the truth. When the Apostle and his disciple Timothy re-visited Ephesus, after the long Caesarean and Roman imprisonment, they found the Church there distracted with questions raised by Jewish teachers. The curious and hair-splitting interpretation of the Mosaic law, the teaching concerning the tithing of mint and anise and cummin, which in the days of Jesus of Nazareth had paralysed all real spiritual life in Jerusalem, had found its way during the Apostle's long enforced absence into the restless, ever-changing congregations at Ephesus.<p>Dangerous controversies, disputings concerning old prophecies, mingled with modern traditions, occupied the attention of many of the Christian teachers. They preferred to talk about theology rather than try to live the life which men like St. Paul had told them that followers of Jesus must live if they would be His servants indeed.<p>Unless these deadening influences were removed, the faith of the Ephesian Church threatened to become utterly impractical. The <span class= "ital">doctrine</span> these restless men were teaching, and which St. Paul so bitterly condemns, seems to have been no settled form of heresy, but a profitless teaching, arising mainly, if not entirely, from Jewish sources.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="accented">Exhorted</span> for <span class="accented">besought</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">tarry</span> for <span class="accented">abide still</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">was going</span> for <span class="accented">went</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">certain men</span> for <span class="accented">some</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">not to teach a different</span> for <span class="accented">that they teach no other</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Exhorted</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>). In about sixty places this word has the sense of "beseech," "entreat," "desire," "pray," which is more suitable to this passage than the R.V. <span class="accented">exhort</span>. It is a strong expression, and seems to imply that Timothy had been anxious to go with St. Paul to Macedonia, to share his labors and wait upon him; but that St. Paul, with that noble disinterestedness which characterized his whole life, had, not without difficulty, persuaded him to abide at Ephesus. <span class="cmt_word">Tarry</span>. Here again the R.V. is unfortunate. The exact sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is "to stay on," or, as in the A.V., "to abide still." The word tells us that Timothy was already at Ephesus when he received the request from St. Paul to stay on there instead of going to Macedonia. There is nothing in the phrase that implies that St. Paul was at Ephesus himself when he made the request to Timothy. It may have been made by message or by letter. <span class="cmt_word">When I was going.</span> Some commentators have endeavored to explain <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as applying to Timothy, or as if the order were <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span>; but the Greek will not admit of it. <span class="cmt_word">Charge</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span>); a word implying authority, almost invariably rendered "command" or "charge." It is taken up in ver. 18 (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), "This charge," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Teach a different doctrine</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>). This is one of the many words peculiar to the pastoral Epistles. It only occurs here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3</a>. It is formed from <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, a teacher of other than right doctrine, and means "to play the part of a teacher of other than right doctrine," just as in ecclesiastical language <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> means "one who holds opinions contrary to that which is orthodox," and such as do so are said <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. The classical sense is a little different, "one who holds a different opinion" - "to be of a different opinion." The introduction of the word into the vocabulary of Scripture is a sign of the somewhat later age to which this Epistle belongs, when heresies were growing and multiplying. Other similar compounds are <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-21.htm">1 Corinthians 14:21</a>) and <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-4 Jesus Christ is a Christian's hope; all our hopes of eternal life are built upon him; and Christ is in us the hope of glory. The apostle seems to have been the means of Timothy's conversion; who served with him in his ministry, as a dutiful son with a loving father. That which raises questions, is not for edifying; that which gives occasion for doubtful disputes, pulls down the church rather than builds it up. Godliness of heart and life can only be kept up and increased, by the exercise of faith in the truths and promises of God, through Jesus Christ.</body></html>
