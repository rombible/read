The adjective <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.) is a translation of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, "<span class="accented">long</span>," or "slow to anger," to which the opposite is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.), "<span class="accented">short</span> to anger," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> hasty, passionate. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> also occurs frequently, both in the New Testament and in the LXX.: <span class="greek">&#x1f29;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, "<span class="accented">Charity</span> suffereth long" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For an example</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). The word only occurs in the New Testament here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-12.htm">2 Timothy 1:12</a>; but both it and the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span> are good classical words. The meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is "<span class="accented">a</span> sketch" or "outline," and hence a "pattern." This pattern is spoken of as being the property of, being for the use of, them which should hereafter believe. Just as the workman looks at his plan, or outline, by which he is to work, so those future believers would see in Christ's dealings with St. Paul the exact pattern of the long-suffering which they might expect for themselves. Others take <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in the sense of "<span class="accented">instruction</span>," but this sense cannot be made good. <span class="cmt_word">Believe on him unto eternal life.</span> These words hang together. The particular force of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, "found in the New Testament only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-11.htm">Romans 10:11</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6</a>" (Huther) - as distinguished from the other constructions of to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> - is "rest," "lean on" (Ellicott). St. Paul thus incidentally affirms that his own faith rested upon Jesus Christ in the full assurance of attaining to eternal life (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-12.htm">1 Timothy 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-1.htm">2 Timothy 1:1, 2</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-17 The apostle knew that he would justly have perished, if the Lord had been extreme to mark what was amiss; and also if his grace and mercy had not been abundant to him when dead in sin, working faith and love to Christ in his heart. This is a faithful saying; these are true and faithful words, which may be depended on, That the Son of God came into the world, willingly and purposely to save sinners. No man, with Paul's example before him, can question the love and power of Christ to save him, if he really desires to trust in him as the Son of God, who once died on the cross, and now reigns upon the throne of glory, to save all that come to God through him. Let us then admire and praise the grace of God our Saviour; and ascribe to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, three Persons in the unity of the Godhead, the glory of all done in, by, and for us.</body></html>
