It seems to be, therefore, quite certain that St. Paul is here using a familiar Jewish phrase for "eternal" which has nothing whatever to do with Gnostic eons. Perhaps in the use of the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, we may trace a contrast passing through the writer's mind between the short-lived power of that hateful <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, Nero, by whom his life would soon be taken away, and the kingdom of the eternal King (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-15.htm">1 Timothy 6:15, 16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Incorruptible</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>); applied to God also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-23.htm">Romans 1:23</a>, where, as here, it means "immortal" (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>), not subject to the <span class="accented">corruption</span> of death, just as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is coupled with "life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-10.htm">2 Timothy 1:10</a>) and opposed to "death" So on the other hand, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span> means "death." <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "perishable." Elsewhere it is applied to a <span class="accented">crown</span>, to the <span class="accented">raised dead</span>, to the <span class="accented">inherit-ante</span> of the saints, to the <span class="accented">seed</span> of the new birth, to the <span class="accented">apparel</span> of a holy heart, which no rust or moth corrupts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-25.htm">1 Corinthians 9:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-52.htm">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-4.htm">1 Peter 3:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Invisible</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>); as <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-27.htm">Hebrews 11:27</a>.

The word is used by Philo of God, and of the Word. Here it is especially predicated of God the Father, according to what our Lord says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-46.htm">John 6:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>); though some of the Fathers, Nicene and post-Nicene, predicate it also of the Word or Second Person (Hilary, Chrysostom, etc.). But in Scripture the Son is spoken of as the Manifestation, the Image (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>) of the Father, through whom t he Father is seen and known; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, therefore, applies to the Father (see Bishop Lightfoot's note on Colossians 1:15). <span class="cmt_word">The only God.</span> The best manuscripts omit <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1ff7;</span>, which seems to have crept in here from <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-26.htm">Romans 16:26</a>. The exact construction is, "To the eternal King, the Immortal, the Invisible, the only God [or, 'who alone is God'], be honor," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Be honor and glory.</span> A little varied from St. Paul's usual doxologies (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>; 6:27; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-5.htm">Galatians 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-21.htm">Ephesians 3:21</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> stands alone, and has the article - Ellicott on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-5.htm">Galatians 1:5</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-10.htm">Romans 2:10</a> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span> are coupled together, but applied to man. This interposition of doxology is quite in St. Paul's manner. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-17 The apostle knew that he would justly have perished, if the Lord had been extreme to mark what was amiss; and also if his grace and mercy had not been abundant to him when dead in sin, working faith and love to Christ in his heart. This is a faithful saying; these are true and faithful words, which may be depended on, That the Son of God came into the world, willingly and purposely to save sinners. No man, with Paul's example before him, can question the love and power of Christ to save him, if he really desires to trust in him as the Son of God, who once died on the cross, and now reigns upon the throne of glory, to save all that come to God through him. Let us then admire and praise the grace of God our Saviour; and ascribe to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, three Persons in the unity of the Godhead, the glory of all done in, by, and for us.</body></html>
