In the mind of St. Paul, "want of faith" was no mere refusal to accept a definite religions dogma, but was ever closely connected with impurity and the love of sin. If a man dares <span class= "ital">to</span> do wilful violence to his better nature he must not presume to dream of <span class= "ital">faith</span> saving him. The thought expressed by another inspired teacher seems to run constantly in the mind of St. Paul: "The devils also <span class= "ital">believe</span> and tremble."<p><span class= "bld">Which some.</span>--"Some." A quiet reference here is made to those false teachers who seem to have been doing such evil work at Ephesus among the Christian believers, and against whom Timothy is so urgently warned to be on his guard in the 6th and following verses of the chapter.<p><span class= "bld">Having put away.</span>--The simile in St. Paul's mind is a nautical one. The "good conscience" represents the ballast, or cargo, of the ship. When this is put away--tossed overboard--the vessel becomes unmanageable and is tossed about, the plaything of the waves, and in the end is wrecked.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="accented">Thrust from them</span> for <span class="accented">put away</span>, A.V.; made <span class="accented">shipwreck concerning the faith</span> for <span class="accented">concerning faith have made shipwreck</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Thrust from them.</span> The addition "from them" is meant to give the force of the middle voice as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-39.htm">Acts 7:39</a>, A.V. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> occurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-27.htm">Acts 7:27, 39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-1.htm">Romans 11:1, 2</a>. It is a strong expression, implying here the willful resistance to the voice of conscience. The form <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, -<span class="greek">&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is found, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46</a>, and frequently in the LXX. <span class="cmt_word">Which</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3bd;</span>) applies to the good conscience only. Hence the important lesson that deviations from the true faith are preceded by violations of the conscience. The surest way to maintain a pure faith is to maintain a good and tender conscience (camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-9.htm">1 Timothy 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The faith.</span> It is by no means certain that <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> here means "the faith" rather than "faith" (subjectire). Both the grammar and the sense equally admit the rendering "faith," referring to the preceding, tiaras. (For the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "with respect to," camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-4.htm">1 Timothy 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-18.htm">2 Timothy 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-7.htm">Titus 2:7</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:18-20 The ministry is a warfare against sin and Satan; carried on under the Lord Jesus, who is the Captain of our salvation. The good hopes others have had of us, should stir us up to duty. And let us be upright in our conduct in all things. The design of the highest censures in the primitive church, was, to prevent further sin, and to reclaim the sinner. May all who are tempted to put away a good conscience, and to abuse the gospel, remember that this is the way to make shipwreck of faith also.</body></html>
