Among the sins which especially excite the hot wrath of the first inspired teachers of Christianity, "want of truth" appears singularly prominent. One after the other of the Apostles, in different language, express their deep abhorrence of this too common sin, which, in St. John's fervid words, will suffice to exclude from the city of the blessed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-15.htm" title="For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and fornicators, and murderers, and idolaters, and whoever loves and makes a lie.">Revelation 22:15</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine.</span>--In this broad and general summary, with which St. Paul concludes his dreadful catalogue, the prohibition of the Tenth Commandment against "covetousness" is doubtless included. In the words "sound doctrine"--an expression peculiar to this group of Epistles--a sharp contrast is suggested to the "sickly and unhealthy" teaching of the false teachers, with their foolish legends and allegories--a teaching which suggested controversy and useless disputes, and had no practical influence at all upon <span class= "ital">life.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="accented">Fornicators</span> for <span class="accented">whoremongers</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">abusers of themselves with men</span> for <span class="accented">them that defile themselves with mankind</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">false swearers for perjured persons</span>.

The design of the gospel is answered, when sinners, through repentance towards God and faith in Jesus Christ, are brought to exercise Christian love. And as believers were righteous persons in God's appointed way, the law was not against them. But unless we are made righteous by faith in Christ, really repenting and forsaking sin, we are yet under the curse of the law, even according to the gospel of the blessed God, and are unfit to share the holy happiness of heaven.</body></html>
