They coveted the respect and influence which was ever paid to the acknowledged teachers of the Law of Moses; but these men utterly failed to understand the real spiritual meaning of that Law which they pretended to teach. Similar pretenders in a neighbouring Church, some years later, received from another Apostle--St. John--a stern rebuke for such pretensions. "I know," wrote St. John to the Christians of Smyrna, "the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-9.htm" title="I know your works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but you are rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.">Revelation 2:9</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</span>--A wise teacher must understand what he teaches, and must, at the same time, be clear in his own mind that what he teaches is true.<p>The false teachers are here charged (1) with not understanding the wild fables and traditions upon which their teaching was based, and (2) with not comprehending the things whereof they make their assertions: that is, they had no real belief in those great truths which really underlie that Law with which they were meddling.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="accented">Though they understand</span> for <span class="accented">understanding</span>.

Elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-8.htm">Titus 3:8</a>, "I will that thou affirm confidently." So in classical Greek, "to maintain strongly," "to be positive." This was right in the minister of Christ declaring Divine truth, but very wrong in these vain janglers. The nature of their confident assertions is apparent from what follows - they spoke of the Law, but not lawfully. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:5-11 Whatever tends to weaken love to God, or love to the brethren, tends to defeat the end of the commandment. The design of the gospel is answered, when sinners, through repentance towards God and faith in Jesus Christ, are brought to exercise Christian love. And as believers were righteous persons in God's appointed way, the law was not against them. But unless we are made righteous by faith in Christ, really repenting and forsaking sin, we are yet under the curse of the law, even according to the gospel of the blessed God, and are unfit to share the holy happiness of heaven.</body></html>
