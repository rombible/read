"The glory of the blessed God," whether as shown in the sufferings of Christ or in the riches of His great mercy, is that which is contained in and revealed by the gospel; in other words, the "contents" of the gospel is the glory and majesty of God. God is called here "blessed," not only on account of His eternal and changeless perfection, but also on account of His blessed gift of forgiveness, offered to all sinners who accept His gospel of love.<p><span class= "bld">Which was committed to my trust.</span>--This precious deposit, this "trust," the gospel of the glory of God, was perhaps, in St. Paul's eyes, his truest title to honour. When we inquire more closely what was exactly meant by "the gospel committed to his trust," something more definite seems to be required than the general answer that he was a minister of the Church, intrusted with the proclamation of his Master's blessed message. If this were all, St. Paul's loved title to honour would have been by no means peculiar to him, but would have been shared by many another in that great company of prophets, teachers, and evangelists of the Church of the first days. St. Paul rather seems to have gloried in some peculiar and most precious trust. Was it not possibly in that Gospel of "Luke," which some of the most venerated of the fathers tell us St. Paul was accustomed to mention as the Gospel written by him? (Irenaeus, Origen, Jerome.) It was, perhaps, this blessed privilege of having been judged worthy to compile, under the direction of the Holy Ghost--or, at all events, largely to furnish materials for--one of the precious records of his adorable Master's earthly lite and work and suffering which St. Paul loved to tell of as his proudest title to honour.<p>To his own disciples--as well as to those who disputed his apostolic authority--he would now and again refer to this, the highest of all honours bestowed on him by his Master; but there the boasting of the holy and humble man of God ended. Though the blessed evangelist St. Paul knew his work was for all the ages, the true humility of the noble servant of Jesus appears in the substitution of "Luke" for "St. Paul"--the scribe's name in place of that of the real author.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="accented">The gospel of the glory</span> for <span class="accented">the glorious gospel</span>, A,V. <span class="cmt_word">The gospel of the glory of the blessed God.</span> The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, cannot mean, as in the A.V., "the glorious gospel of the blessed God," except by a very forced construction.

Or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> it might mean the gospel which tells of the glory of God, which reveals and proclaims his glory, the glory of his grace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-6.htm">Ephesians 1:6, 12</a>), or perhaps here rather the glory of his holiness, which St. Paul's "sound doctrine" pressed for imitation upon all Christians (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3</a>); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>, "<span class="accented">The</span> gospel of the glory of Christ."

In classical Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span> is the proper epithet of the gods; <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is usually spoken of men or qualities, and especially of the happy dead. It does not appear how or why the apostle here applies <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> to God. <span class="cmt_word">Committed to my trust</span>; literally, <span class="accented">with which I was entrusted</span>.

The design of the gospel is answered, when sinners, through repentance towards God and faith in Jesus Christ, are brought to exercise Christian love. And as believers were righteous persons in God's appointed way, the law was not against them. But unless we are made righteous by faith in Christ, really repenting and forsaking sin, we are yet under the curse of the law, even according to the gospel of the blessed God, and are unfit to share the holy happiness of heaven.</body></html>
