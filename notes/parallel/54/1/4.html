It was said in the Jewish schools that an oral Law had been given on Sinai, and that this Law, a succession of teachers, from the time of Moses, had handed down. This "Law that is upon the lip," as it was termed, was further illustrated and enlarged by the sayings and comments of the more famous Jewish Rabbis, and in the time of our Lord constituted a supplement to the written Law in the Pentateuch. For centuries this supplementary code was preserved by memory or in secret rolls, and doubtless was constantly receiving additions. It contained, along with many wild and improbable legendary histories, some wise teachings. This strange collection of tradition and comment was committed to writing in the second century by Rabbi Jehuda, under the general name of the Mishna, or repetition (of the Law). Round this compilation a complement of discussions (the Gemara) was gradually formed, and was completed at Babylon somewhere about the end of the fifth century of our era. These works--the Mishna and the Gemara, together with a second Gemara, formed somewhat earlier in Palestine--are generally known as the Talmud. The influence of some of these traditions is alluded to by our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-3.htm" title="But he answered and said to them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?">Matthew 15:3</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Endless genealogies.</span>--Genealogies in their proper sense, as found in the Book of the Pentateuch, and to which wild allegorical interpretations had been assigned. Such purely fanciful meanings had been already developed by Philo, whose religious writings were becoming at this time known and popular in many of the Jewish schools. Such teaching, if allowed in the Christian churches, St. Paul saw would effectually put a stop to the growth of Gentile Christendom. It would inculcate an undue and exaggerated, and, for the ordinary Gentile convert, an impossible reverence for Jewish forms and ceremonies; it would separate the Jewish and Gentile converts into two classes--placing the favoured Jew in an altogether different position from the outcast Gentile.<p>In the Gentile churches founded by the Apostles, for some years a life and death struggle went on between the pupils of St. Paul and his fellow Apostles and the disciples of the Rabbinical schools. In these earnest warnings of his Pastoral Epistles the great Apostle of Gentile Christianity shows us, how clearly he foresaw that if these Jewish fables and the comments of the older Jewish teachers were allowed to enter into the training of the new-formed congregations, the Church of Christ would shrink, in no long space of time, into the narrow and exclusive limits of a Jewish sect. "Judaism," writes the anonymous author of <span class= "ital">Paul of Tarsus, </span>"was the cradle of Christianity, and Judaism very nearly became its grave."<p><span class= "bld">Which minister questions.</span>--Disputings, questions of mere controversy, inquiries, which could not possibly have any bearing on practical life.<p><span class= "bld">Rather than godly edifying which is in faith.</span>--The rendering of the reading in the more ancient authorities would be: <span class= "ital">rather than the dispensation</span> <span class= "ital">of God which is in faith;</span> or, in other words, the introduction into Church teaching of these Jewish myths--these traditions of the elders, these fanciful genealogies--would be much more likely to produce bitter and profitless controversy than to minister to God's scheme of salvation, designed by God, and proclaimed by His Apostles.<p><span class= "bld">So do.</span>--The Apostle, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm" title="As I sought you to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine,">1Timothy 1:3</a>, begins this sentence of earnest exhortation, but in his fervour forgets to conclude it. The closing words would naturally come in here: "For remember how I besought thee when I left thee behind at Ephesus, when I went on to Macedonia, to discourage and firmly repress all vain teaching, which only leads to useless controversy, <span class= "ital">so I do now;"</span> or, so I repeat to you now. (This is better and more forcible than the words supplied in the English version: "so do.")<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="accented">To give</span> for <span class="accented">give</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the which</span> for <span class="accented">which</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">questionings</span> for <span class="accented">questions</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a dispensation of God</span> for <span class="accented">godly edifying</span>, A.V. and T.R.

If the spirit which gave birth to the fables of the Talmud was already at work among the Jews, we have a ready explanation of the phrase. And that they were Jewish fables (not later Gnostic delusions) is proved by the parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-14.htm">Titus 1:14</a>, "Not giving heed to Jewish fables." The prevalence of sorcery among the Jews at this time is a further instance of their inclination to fable (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-9.htm">Acts 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-6.htm">Acts 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-13.htm">Acts 19:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Endless genealogies.</span> What was the particular abuse of genealogies which St. Paul here condemns we have not sufficient historical knowledge to enable us to decide. But that they were Jewish forms of "vain talking," and not Gnostic, and related to human pedigrees, not to "emanations of eons," may be concluded from the connection in which they are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-9.htm">Titus 3:9</a>, and from the invariable meaning of the word <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> itself. It is true that Irenaeus ('Contr. Haer.,' lib. 1.) applies this passage to the Valentinians and their succession of eons (Bythus, Nous, Logos, Anthropus, etc. - in all thirty, male and female); and so does Tertullian, who speaks of the seeds of the Gnostic heresies as already budding in St. Paul's days ('Advers Valentin.,' cap 3. and elsewhere), and Grotius supports thin explanation ('Comment.,' <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-4.htm">1 Timothy 1:4</a>). But it was very natural that Irenaeus and Tertullian, living when the heresies of Valentinus, Marcion, and others were at their height, should so accommodate St. Paul's words - which is all that Irenaeus does. On the other band, neither Irenaeus nor Tertullian shows that <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> was a word applied to the emanations of the eons in the Gnostic vocabulary. The genealogies, then, were Jewish pedigrees, either used <span class="accented">literally</span> to exalt individuals as being of priestly or Davidic origin (as the pedigrees of the Desposyni, or later of the princes of the Captivity), or used <span class="accented">cabbalistically</span>, so as to draw fanciful doctrines from the names composing a genealogy, or in some other way which we do not know of (see the writers 'Genealogies of Christ,' <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3.htm">1 Timothy 3</a>. &sect; 2:1; and note C at the end of the volume). <span class="accented">Endless</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); found only here in the New Testament and so one of the words peculiar to the pastoral Epistles, but used in the LXX. for "infinite," "immeasurable." It means either "endless," "<span class="accented">interminable</span>," or, "having no useful end or purpose;" <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (Chrysostom). But the former ("interminable") is the better rendering, and in accordance with its classical use. <span class="cmt_word">Questionings</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, R.T.).

The reading <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is only found here. <span class="cmt_word">A dispensation of God.</span> This version arises from the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, which is the reading of the R.T. and almost all manuscripts. The T.R. <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> thought to be a conjecture of Erasmus, which, from its much easier sense, was taken into the T.R. Taking the reading <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, the phrase, "a dispensation of God which is in faith," must mean the gospel as delivered by revelation and received by faith. These fables and genealogies address themselves, the apostle says, to the disputatious, itching curiosity of men's minds, not to their faith. The substance of them is matter of doubtful disputation, not revealed truth. "<span class="accented">The</span> dispensation" <span class="accented">is</span> better English than "<span class="accented">a</span> dispensation." <span class="cmt_word">So do I now</span>; or, as the A.V., <span class="accented">so do</span>, is the conjectural filling up of the unfinished sentence which began "<span class="accented">as I</span> exhorted thee." But it is much more natural and simple to take ver. 18 as the apodosis, and the intermediate verses as a digression caused by St. Paul's desire to show how exactly the charge was in agreement with the true spirit of the Law of God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-4 Jesus Christ is a Christian's hope; all our hopes of eternal life are built upon him; and Christ is in us the hope of glory. The apostle seems to have been the means of Timothy's conversion; who served with him in his ministry, as a dutiful son with a loving father. That which raises questions, is not for edifying; that which gives occasion for doubtful disputes, pulls down the church rather than builds it up. Godliness of heart and life can only be kept up and increased, by the exercise of faith in the truths and promises of God, through Jesus Christ.</body></html>
