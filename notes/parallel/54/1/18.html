The sum of it was that men should put their whole trust in Him who came into the world to save sinners, and who alone was able to lead them into everlasting life. There is something very solemn in St. Paul's pressing home this charge to Timothy, and invoking the memory of the prophecies which went before on him. The charge was the last precious heritage, the priceless treasure which the old master, feeling that for him the end was not far distant, would leave to his favourite disciple--his own dear son in the faith. Anxious above measure for the loved group of Asian churches, of which Ephesus was the centre, foreseeing that the present perils and dangers from within and without would rapidly close round the congregations, and placing his greatest earthly hope on the steadfastness and knowledge of his own dear disciple whom he had left there as a shepherd to the sheep, he charges his son Timothy, by the memory of those strange prophetic utterances which, years before, had been made over him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/17-1.htm" title="Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:">Acts 17:1-2</a>) in Lystra or Derbe, and which, perhaps, had first induced him to choose the young son of Eunice as his friend and companion, to hold fast the blessed doctrine which taught men to put their whole trust in Jesus Christ.<p><span class= "bld">According to the prophecies which went before on thee.</span>--These prophetic utterances seem to have been not unfrequent in the days of the Apostles, and were among the precious gifts which enriched and encouraged the Church of the first days. We read of them at Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/11-27.htm" title="And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch.">Acts 11:27-28</a>), at Antioch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.">Acts 13:1-2</a>), at Corinth (1 Corinthians 14), at Caesarea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/21-8.htm" title="And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came to Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and stayed with him.">Acts 21:8-10</a>).<p>In the case of Timothy they appear to have been farseeing glances into the life and the work and the teaching of the future Christian leader; here the last named--the doctrine and teaching--is especially referred to. The prophecies in question were uttered, no doubt, over him at his ordination, and, possibly, some of them at his baptism.<p><span class= "bld">That thou by them mightest war a good</span> warfare.--Better rendered, <span class= "ital">that thou in them, </span>&c. St. Paul committed the sacred charge to Timothy concerning the faith in full confidence that, in accordance with those well-remembered glorious predictions which had been made foretelling his future zeal and success in the promulgation of the gospel, that in these--accoutred in these as his spiritual protection and armour--Timothy would wage his warfare against sin and evil.<p>St. Paul's words in this verse may be thus paraphrased: I give this charge to you, son Timothy, in accordance with those well-remembered predictions respecting your future steadfastness in doctrine and in life. I remind you now of them, Do not disappoint these grand hopes--these prophecies of your future--but bear them ever in your mind. Equip yourself in them as your spiritual armour, and so armed, fight your Master's fight against sin and evil--eine gute Ritterschaft, according to Luther.<p>The war imagery here used St. Paul employs again and again: <span class= "ital">the</span> good warfare. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-12.htm" title="Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto you are also called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.">1Timothy 6:12</a>.) To the old, tried Apostle a Christian's life is a warfare in the truest sense of the word: to every believer it is a weary, painful campaign. In the case of the professed teachers a sleepless vigilance was especially demanded.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="accented">My child</span> for <span class="accented">son</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">by them thou mayest</span> for <span class="accented">thou by them mightest</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the good</span> for <span class="accented">a good</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">This charge.</span> The apostle now picks up the thread which he had dropped at ver. 4, and solemnly commits to Timothy the episcopal care of the Ephesian Church, for which he had bid him stop at Ephesus. Omitting the long digression in vers. 5-17, the sense runs clearly thus: "As I besought thee to tarry at Ephesus in order that thou mightest charge some not to teach a different doctrine, so now do I place this charge in thy hands, according to the prophecies which pointed to thee, that thou mayest war the good warfare according to the tenor of them." He thus adds that he entrusted this charge to Timothy, not <span class="accented">mero</span> <span class="accented">motu</span>, but according to direct indications of the Holy Ghost, through the prophets of the Church, which pointed out Timothy as the person who was to war that good warfare. The words, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, might possibly depend upon <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, meaning that those prophecies had this end in pointing to Timothy, viz. that he might war the good warfare, that he might be placed in the difficult post of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, and the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> follows rather more naturally in this case. But it is, perhaps, better to take them as dependent upon <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>By them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). Here <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> may be either the <span class="accented">causae efficiens</span>, indicating that by the influence of these prophecies Timothy would war the good warfare, or be equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span>, "according to" (see Schleusner's 'Lexicon'). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:18-20 The ministry is a warfare against sin and Satan; carried on under the Lord Jesus, who is the Captain of our salvation. The good hopes others have had of us, should stir us up to duty. And let us be upright in our conduct in all things. The design of the highest censures in the primitive church, was, to prevent further sin, and to reclaim the sinner. May all who are tempted to put away a good conscience, and to abuse the gospel, remember that this is the way to make shipwreck of faith also.</body></html>
