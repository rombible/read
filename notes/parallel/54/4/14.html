It was in many respects a similar office, that which Timothy held about St. Paul, to that which in old days Elisha had held with Elijah; and, as in the case of the Hebrew prophet of the old dispensation, so here, the choice of St. Paul had been divinely guided. The very titles of the old covenant dispensation seem to have been revived in this instance of the divine selection of Timothy; for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-11.htm" title="But you, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.">1Timothy 6:11</a> the older Apostle addresses his representative at Ephesus with the old prophetic title when he writes: "<span class= "ital">Thou, O man of God, </span>flee these things." <span class= "ital">Now</span> he solemnly calls attention to that strange, miraculous "grace" which some inspired prophet at his ordination declared was to be conferred on Timothy. The "gift" was said to be conferred, as to its certainty in the divine counsels, by such prophecy--the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of one or more of His prophets, declaring His will and intention to confer this special grace on the young companion of St. Paul.<p><span class= "bld">With the laying on of the hands.</span>--This was a symbolic action--the outward sign of an inward communication of the Holy Spirit for some spiritual office or undertaking--and was derived from the old solemn Hebrew custom. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-10.htm" title="And you shall bring the Levites before the LORD: and the children of Israel shall put their hands on the Levites:">Numbers 8:10</a> in the case of the consecration of the Levites, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-18.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Take you Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay your hand on him;">Numbers 27:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-9.htm" title="And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands on him: and the children of Israel listened to him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.">Deuteronomy 34:9</a> in the ceremony of the dedication of Joshua.)<p><span class= "bld">Of the presbytery.</span>--The brotherhood of presbyters connected with the place where the ordination of Timothy took place is here alluded to. There appears to have been such a body of elders in each particular city or district. The presbytery in this instance would seem in all probability to have belonged to the district of Lystra, Timothy's native city; but an old ecclesiastical tradition speaks of Ephesus as the place of this ordination.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The gift</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means "<span class="accented">to</span> give anything freely," gratuitously, of mere good will, without any payment or return (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-42.htm">Luke 7:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-24.htm">Acts 27:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-12.htm">1 Corinthians 2:12</a>, etc.). Hence <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> came to be especially applied to the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which are preeminently "free gifts" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-20.htm">Acts 8:20</a>). It is so applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-7.htm">1 Corinthians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4, 9, 28, 30, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10</a>. Here, then, as in the similar passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6</a>, the "<span class="accented">gift"</span> spoken of is the special grace given by the Holy Ghost to those who are separated for "<span class="accented">the</span> office and work of a priest in the Church of God by the imposition of hands" (Ordering of Priests). This gift St. Paul bids him <span class="cmt_word">not neglect</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). The word contains the idea of contemptuous neglect - neglect as of an unimportant thing. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-5.htm">Matthew 22:5</a> the persons invited to the feast made light of it, and went away to other things which they cared mere about. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-3.htm">Hebrews 2:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, and Hebrews 8:9, imply a contemptuous disregard. So here Timothy is reminded that in his ordination he received a great <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, and that he must value it duly, and use it diligently. It must not be let lie slumbering and smoldering, but must be stirred up into a flame. The lesson here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6</a> seems to be that we must look back to our ordination, and to the spiritual grace given in it, as things not exhausted. The grace is there, but it must not be lightly thought cf. <span class="cmt_word">Which was given thee by prophecy.</span> This seems to be explained by <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1-3</a>, where Barnabas and Saul were separated for their work by the laying on of the hands apparently of the prophets and teachers, at the express command of the Holy Ghost, speaking doubtless by the mouth of one of the prophets. Timothy, it appears, was designated for his work by a like command of the Holy Ghost, speaking by one of the Church prophets, and received his commission by a like "<span class="accented">laying</span> on of hands" by the elders of the Church. If St. Paul refers, as he appears to do, to the same occasion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6</a>, then it appears that he laid his hands on Timothy, together with the presbyters, as is done by the bishop in the ordination of priests. <span class="cmt_word">The presbytery</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). The word is borrowed from the Jewish nomenclature (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-6.htm">Luke 22:6</a>; <span class="accented">Acts</span> 22:5). In a slightly different sense for "the office of a presbyter," Sus., 5:50 (Cod. Alex.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:11-16 Men's youth will not be despised, if they keep from vanities and follies. Those who teach by their doctrine, must teach by their life. Their discourse must be edifying; their conversation must be holy; they must be examples of love to God and all good men, examples of spiritual-mindedness. Ministers must mind these things as their principal work and business. By this means their profiting will appear in all things, as well as to all persons; this is the way to profit in knowledge and grace, and also to profit others. The doctrine of a minister of Christ must be scriptural, clear, evangelical, and practical; well stated, explained, defended, and applied. But these duties leave no leisure for wordly pleasures, trifling visits, or idle conversation, and but little for what is mere amusement, and only ornamental. May every believer be enabled to let his profiting appear unto all men; seeking to experience the power of the gospel in his own soul, and to bring forth its fruits in his life.</body></html>
