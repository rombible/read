The "words of the Spirit" here allude to a mysterious power, to a divine gift, traces of which occur again and again in the New Testament pages. Among the supernatural signs which were vouchsafed to the first generation of believers, and with very rare exceptions only to the first generation--to men and women, many, if not most, of whom had seen Jesus, and had had personal contact with Him--must be reckoned those mysterious intimations of the will of the Holy Spirit which guided and encouraged the Church of the first days. That intimation came in varied forms: to the Twelve in the form of fiery tongues (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/2-1.htm" title="And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.">Acts 2:1-12</a>); to a more numerous company (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-31.htm" title="And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.">Acts 4:31</a>); to Peter on the occasion of the conversion of Cornelius (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/10-10.htm" title="And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,">Acts 10:10-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/10-19.htm" title="While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek you.">Acts 10:19-20</a>); to St. Paul on three occasions in the course of his second missionary journey (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/16-6.htm" title="Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,">Acts 16:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/16-9.htm" title="And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.">Acts 16:9-10</a>); through the medium of the prophet Agabus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-11.htm" title="And when he was come to us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus said the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that ownes this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.">Acts 21:11</a>). St. Paul alludes to many such voices of the Spirit, and heavenly intimations, when speaking to the elders of Miletus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-23.htm" title="Save that the Holy Ghost witnesses in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.">Acts 20:23</a>). One of these special revelations, made to himself, he here quotes.<p><span class= "bld">In the latter times.</span>--All those ages are here referred to which succeed the coming of the Lord. In these Paul lived, and we are still watching the slow and solemn march past of these latter ages. The errors foreseen then, have more or less affected the internal government of the Church during the eighteen hundred years which have passed since St. Paul's words were written. In no age, perhaps, have they been more ostentatiously thrust forward than in our own.<p><span class= "bld">Some shall depart from the faith.</span>--"By denying what is true, by adding what is false," says Bengel.<p><span class= "bld">Giving heed to seducing spirits.</span>--This expression must not be watered down by explanations which understand this expression as referring to false teachers. The "seducing spirits" are none other than created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. (4) For every creature of God <span class= "ital">is</span> good, and nothing to be refused, if it be evil powers and spirits subject to Satan, and which are permitted to influence and to work in human hearts. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm" title="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a>--passages in which these spiritual communities of wickedness and their powers over men are again alluded to by St. Paul.)<p><span class= "bld">Doctrines of</span> <span class= "bld">devils.</span>--Doctrines and thoughts taught by, suggested by, evil spirits. The personality of these unhappy beings is clearly taught by St. Paul. Of their influence in the heathen world and their antagonism to Christ and His followers, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/10-20.htm" title="But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that you should have fellowship with devils.">1Corinthians 10:20-21</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="accented">But</span> for <span class="accented">now</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">saith</span> for <span class="accented">speaketh</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">later</span> for <span class="accented">the latter</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">fall away</span> for <span class="accented">depart</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit saith expressly</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>); only here in the New Testament, and very rare in classical Greek. But the adjective <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, in the sense of something "laid down," "definite.... expressly mentioned," is common. It was, doubtless, on account of these prophetic warnings of a falling away from the faith, that the apostle gave the preceding heads of Christian doctrine in such a terse and tangible form, and laid such a solemn charge upon Timothy. (For examples of these prophetic utterances, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-28.htm">Acts 11:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-23.htm">Acts 20:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-11.htm">Acts 21:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-8.htm">1 Corinthians 12:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14.htm">1 Corinthians 14</a>.

So St. Paul says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>) that the day of Christ will not be, "except the falling away (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) come first" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The faith</span>; objective (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-9.htm">1 Timothy 3:9</a> and 16, note). This "falling away" is to take place <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>; not, as in the R.V., in "later times," but as in the A.V., "the latter times." The adjective <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is only found here in the New Testament. But in the LXX. (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-29.htm">1 Chronicles 29:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-19.htm">Jeremiah 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-17.htm">Jeremiah 27:17</a>, LXX.), <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> means "the last," as opposed to "the first." And so the adverb <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> always in the New Testament (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-37.htm">Matthew 21:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-60.htm">Matthew 26:60</a>; or more fully <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, 22:27).

Such were the "lying spirits" who deceived (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented">Ahab</span> to his destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22</a>:22). <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, seducing, is not elsewhere found in the New Testament as an adjective (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-63.htm">Matthew 27:63</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-8.htm">2 Corinthians 6:8</a> 2John 7, in all which places, however, it is almost an adjective). The idea is "causing to wander," or "go astray." St. John warns his people against such deceiving spirits (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1-6</a>). He calls them generically <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "the spirit of error." <span class="cmt_word">Doctrines of devils</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> teachings suggested by devils. So the unbelieving Jews suggested that John the Baptist had a devil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-33.htm">Luke 7:33</a>), and that our Lord himself had a devil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-20.htm">John 7:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-48.htm">John 8:48, 52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-19.htm">John 10:19</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-5 The Holy Spirit, both in the Old and the New Testament, spoke of a general turning from the faith of Christ, and the pure worship of God. This should come during the Christian dispensation, for those are called the latter days. False teachers forbid as evil what God has allowed, and command as a duty what he has left indifferent. We find exercise for watchfulness and self-denial, in attending to the requirements of God's law, without being tasked to imaginary duties, which reject what he has allowed. But nothing justifies an intemperate or improper use of things; and nothing will be good to us, unless we seek by prayer for the Lord's blessing upon it.</body></html>
