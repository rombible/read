The stern repression of all human passions and desires, the abstinence from all compliance with the natural impulses of the flesh--such an unnatural warfare, such an exercise, such a training of the body, no doubt in many cases would lead, in many cases certainly has led, the individual to a higher spiritual state. Such a total surrender for the one who so exercises himself is, no doubt, in a certain sense, "profitable." But then it must be remembered that this kind of victory over the flesh, in very many instances, leads to an unnatural state of mind; for the rigid ascetic has removed himself from the platform on which ordinary men and women move. His thoughts have ceased to be their thoughts, his ways are no longer their ways. For practical everyday life such an influence, always limited, is at times positively harmful, as its tendency is to depreciate that home-life and family-life, to raise and elevate which is the true object of Christian teaching. Still, the Apostle, while remembering, and in his teaching ever carrying out, the spirit of the Lord's solemn prayer to the Father, "I pray, <span class= "ital">not</span> that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil," refrains from an <span class= "ital">entire</span> condemnation of a life which received, on more than one occasion, from the lips of the Sinless One a guarded commendation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-21.htm" title="However, this kind goes not out but by prayer and fasting.">Matthew 17:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-12.htm" title="For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.">Matthew 19:12</a>).<p>St. Paul, in his divinely-taught wisdom, recognises that such an austere and severe example and life, though by no means the ideal life of a Christian teacher, yet in the great world workshop of the Master might receive a blessing as "profitable for little."<p><span class= "bld">But godliness is profitable unto all things.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">for all things.</span> But while this "bodily exorcise," this austere subduing of the flesh, can only weigh with a narrow and circumscribed group, St. Paul points out that the influence of "godliness is world-wide;" a godliness, not merely an inward holiness, but an operative, active piety, which, springing from an intense love for Christ, manifests itself in love for His creatures. This godliness transfigures, and illumines with its divine radiance all busy, active life--every condition, every rank, all ages. That surely is what the good minister of Jesus Christ must aim at!<p><span class= "bld">Having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</span>--For this godliness, which may and ought to enter into all states, all ages of life, promises the greatest happiness to those who struggle after it. It promises "life"--that is, the highest blessedness which the creature can enjoy in this world--as well as the rich prospect of the endless life with God in the world to come; whereas a false asceticism crushes out all the joy and gladness of this present life, and is an unreal preparation for that which is future.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="accented">Is profitable for a little</span> for <span class="accented">profiteth little</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">for</span>, for <span class="accented">unto</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">which</span> for <span class="accented">that</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Bodily exercise.</span> Exercise which only affects the body, such as those rules which the Jewish ascetics enforced. <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> only occurs here in the New Testament, and not at all in the LXX., but is not uncommon in classical Greek. Another form is <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is the place where such <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> takes place. <span class="cmt_word">For a little</span>; margin, <span class="accented">for little</span>, which is the best rendering, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, as Ellicott well remarks, may mean either "for a little while" or "for a little" (better, "for little"), but cannot mean both. The contrast with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> determines its meaning here to be "for little," which is exactly the same meaning as the A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Promise of the life.</span> The genitive here is the genitive of the thing promised, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-33.htm">Acts 2:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-14.htm">Galatians 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-1.htm">2 Timothy 1:1</a>. And the thing promised is "the life that now is," meaning, of course, its enjoyment in peace and happiness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-12.htm">Psalm 34:12</a> [33, LXX]., where <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> is parallel to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>); and "that which is to come," viz. eternal life). There is no occasion to strain after greater grammatical precision. There is no contradiction between tiffs statement of the happiness of a godly life and St. Paul's statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-19.htm">1 Corinthians 15:19</a>. Another possible way of construing the words is that of Bishop Ellicott and the 'Speaker's Commentary:' "Having the promise of life, both the present and the future." But in this case we should have had <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:6-10 Outward acts of self-denial profit little. What will it avail us to mortify the body, if we do not mortify sin? No diligence in mere outward things could be of much use. The gain of godliness lies much in the promise; and the promises to godly people relate partly to the life that now is, but especially to the life which is to come: though we lose for Christ, we shall not lose by him. If Christ be thus the Saviour of all men, then much more will he be the Rewarder of those who seek and serve him; he will provide well for those whom he has made new creatures.</body></html>
