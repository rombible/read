Their hypocrisy consisted in their assumption of a mask of holiness, which holiness they considered was derived from their false asceticism and their abstinence from things which the Apostle proceeded to show were lawful.<p><span class= "bld">Having their conscience seared with a hot iron.</span>--Better rendered, <span class= "ital">Branded in their own con-science as with a hot iron.</span> The image is drawn from the practice of branding slaves and certain criminals on their forehead with a mark. "<span class= "ital">Qua nota turpitudinis</span> <span class= "ital">non inusta tua vita est?" </span>(Cic. <span class= "ital">Cat.</span> i. 6.) These men tried to teach the efficacy of a substitution of certain counsels of perfection in place of a faithful loving life. They based their teaching on wild Oriental speculations about the evil nature of all matter. They were often themselves evil-livers, who, conscious of their own stained, scarred lives, strove with a show of outward sanctity and hypocritical self-denial to beguile and to lead astray others, and in the end to make them as vile as themselves.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="accented">Through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies</span> for <span class="accented">speaking lies in hypocrisy</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">branded in their own conscience as with</span> for <span class="accented">having their conscience seared with</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Through the hypocrisy of men</span>, etc. The construction is rather obscure, as the most obvious way of construing is that of the A.V., where <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> must agree with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>. But then the clause, "having their conscience seared with a hot iron," does not suit "devils." It is therefore, perhaps, best to translate the clause as the R.V. does, and to explain, with Bishop Ellicott, that the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, which precedes <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, defines the <span class="accented">instrument</span> by which they were led to give heed to seducing spirits, viz. the hypocritical preterites of the men who spake lies, and whose consciences were seared. If <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> agrees with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, we must conceive that St. Paul passes insensibly from "<span class="accented">the</span> devils" to the false teachers who spake as they taught them. In the Gospels, the speech of the devils, and of those possessed by devils, is often interchanged, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-33.htm">Luke 4:33, 34, 41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-23.htm">Mark 1:23, 24</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Men that speak lies</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span>); only found here in the New Testament, but occasionally in classical Greek. Branded (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>); here only in the New Testament, but used in Greek medical and other writers for "<span class="accented">to</span> brand," or "<span class="accented">cauterize</span>;" <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, a branding-iron. The application of the image is somewhat uncertain. If the idea is that of "a brand," a mark burnt in upon the forehead of a slave or criminal, then the meaning is that these men have their own infamy stamped upon their own consciences. It is not patent only to others, but to themselves also. But if the metaphor is from the cauterizing a wound, as the A.V. takes it, then the idea is that these men's consciences are become as insensible to the touch as the skin that has been cauterized is. The metaphor, in this case, is somewhat similar to that of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-5.htm">Mark 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-52.htm">Mark 6:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-40.htm">John 12:40</a>, etc.). The latter interpretation seems to suit the general context best, and the medical use of the term, which St. Paul might have learnt from Luke. The emphasis of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "their own conscience," implies that they were not merely deceivers of others, but were self-deceived. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-5 The Holy Spirit, both in the Old and the New Testament, spoke of a general turning from the faith of Christ, and the pure worship of God. This should come during the Christian dispensation, for those are called the latter days. False teachers forbid as evil what God has allowed, and command as a duty what he has left indifferent. We find exercise for watchfulness and self-denial, in attending to the requirements of God's law, without being tasked to imaginary duties, which reject what he has allowed. But nothing justifies an intemperate or improper use of things; and nothing will be good to us, unless we seek by prayer for the Lord's blessing upon it.</body></html>
