To Paul the aged, his son in the faith seemed still youthful--at this time Timothy could not have been more than forty years of age. The old master would have his young disciple supply the want of years by a gravity of life; he would have him, while fearless, at the same time modest and free from all that pretentious assumption, unhappily so often seen when the comparatively young are placed in positions of dignity and authority. Paul proceeds further to explain his solemn warning by instancing the especial points in which Timothy was to be a pattern to the other believers. These gentle words of warning, such notices as we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-23.htm" title="Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your often infirmities.">1Timothy 5:23</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/16-10.htm" title="Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do.">1Corinthians 16:10-11</a>, seem to point to the fact of there being nothing <span class= "ital">winning</span> in the personal appearance of Timothy, but rather the contrary. It is deserving of comment that among the more famous of the early Christian leaders, beauty of face and form appears to have been the exception rather than the rule. This was, of course, utterly different from the old Grecian idea of gods and heroes. It was no doubt part of the counsel of God that this world-religion should owe nothing to the ordinary conditions of human success. The teaching was novel and opposed to the maxims which guided and influenced the old world. The noblest ideals proposed for Christian imitation were strange and hitherto unheard of. The very foremost preachers of the faith of Christ, as in the case of Timothy, seem to have owed nothing to those personal gifts so highly prized among Pagan nations. So the appearance of St. Paul, the greatest of the early Christian leaders, seems to have been mean and insignificant, "<span class= "ital">ein armes diirres Mannlein</span>" as Luther has it. The blessed Founder of the religion is described by Tertullian, who lived in the same century with those who must have conversed with Christ's disciples, as "having no human beauty, much less any celestial splendour." Clement of Alexandria, Justin Martyr, and other very early writers, join in the same testimony. It is, however, only fair to say that on this point the view of Origen appears to have been different. The Messianic prophecies evidently looked forward to this as the will of the Most High. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/22-6.htm" title="But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.">Psalm 22:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-15.htm" title="My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue sticks to my jaws; and you have brought me into the dust of death.">Psalm 22:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-17.htm" title="I may tell all my bones: they look and stare on me.">Psalm 22:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-14.htm" title="As many were astonished at you; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:">Isaiah 52:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/53-2.htm" title="For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he has no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.">Isaiah 53:2-4</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">In word.</span>--This refers to the public utterances in teaching and exhortation, but more particularly to the <span class= "ital">words</span> used by Timothy in social intercourse. These, in such a life as that of the young presiding elder of the Ephesian Church, must have been of the deepest importance. The tone of his conversation was no doubt imitated by many, it would influence for good or evil the whole Christian society of that great centre. The words of men placed in such a position should ever be true and generous, helpful and encouraging, and, above all, free from slander, from all low and pitiful conceptions of others.<p><span class= "bld">In conversation.</span>--This rendering might mislead--the Greek word signifies rather "manner of life," or "conduct."<p><span class= "bld">In charity.</span>--Better rendered, <span class= "ital">in love.</span> This and the following "in faith," comprehend the great graces in that inner Christian life of which the "words of the mouth," and "conduct," are the outward manifestations. He was to be the example to the flock in "love" to his neighbours, and in "faith" towards God.<p>The words "in spirit," which in the English version occur between "in charity," and "in faith," are found in none of the older authorities.<p><span class= "bld">In purity.</span>--Chastity of mind as well as body is here signified. The ruler of a church--among whose members evidently a school of teaching existed in which a life of stern asceticism was urged on the Christian believer as the only acceptable or even possible way of life for the servant of Christ--must be above all things watchful lest he should seem to set a careless example in the matter of morality.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - An <span class="accented">ensample to them that believe</span> for <span class="accented">an example of the believers</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">manner of fife</span> for <span class="accented">conversation</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">love</span> for <span class="accented">charity</span>, A.V.; R.T. omits <span class="accented">in spirit</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Let no man despise thy youth</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-11.htm">1 Corinthians 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-15.htm">Titus 2:15</a>). The construction of the sentence is manifestly that adopted in the A.V. and followed in the R.V. Timothy would certainly be under forty years at this time, and might be not above thirty-five. Either age would be decidedly early for so responsible an office - one in which he would have many elders (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) under him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-1.htm">1 Timothy 5:1, 17, 19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">An ensample</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); properly the original "pattern" or "model" after which anything is made or fashioned; hence a "pattern" or "example."

Those who teach by their doctrine, must teach by their life. Their discourse must be edifying; their conversation must be holy; they must be examples of love to God and all good men, examples of spiritual-mindedness. Ministers must mind these things as their principal work and business. By this means their profiting will appear in all things, as well as to all persons; this is the way to profit in knowledge and grace, and also to profit others. The doctrine of a minister of Christ must be scriptural, clear, evangelical, and practical; well stated, explained, defended, and applied. But these duties leave no leisure for wordly pleasures, trifling visits, or idle conversation, and but little for what is mere amusement, and only ornamental. May every believer be enabled to let his profiting appear unto all men; seeking to experience the power of the gospel in his own soul, and to bring forth its fruits in his life.</body></html>
