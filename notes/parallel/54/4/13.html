(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-16.htm" title="And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.">Luke 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-15.htm" title="And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, You men and brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.">Acts 13:15</a>.) In these early Christian assemblies, about the year 66-67, the question arises, Were any Scriptures read in public besides the books of the Old Testament? No certain reply can be given: it is, however, probable, even at this very early date, that one at least of the older Gospels (probably St. Mark) was already known and used in the Christian churches, and read along with the Scriptures of the old covenant. That the reading of the "Gospels" very soon became a part of the regular service in the congregations of Christians is evident from the words of Justin Martyr, <span class= "ital">Apologia, </span>i. 67, written in the first half of the first century.<p><span class= "bld">To exhortation, to doctrine.</span>--These both most probably refer to the public ministry in the congregation. The first, "exhortation," particularly applies to the <span class= "ital">feelings.</span> The reading of the Scriptures must be followed by an earnest practical application of their teaching to the affairs of that life in the midst of which the Christian listener was living. The word "doctrine" suggests a public teaching directed rather to the <span class= "ital">understanding</span> of the hearers. The idea of exposition, or even of dogmatic teaching, seems here included.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="accented">Heed</span> for <span class="accented">attendance</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">teaching</span> for <span class="accented">doctrine</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Till I come</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-14.htm">1 Timothy 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Reading</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). The public reading of the Scriptures (the Lessons, as we should say). This we know was the practice in the synagogue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-27.htm">Acts 13:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-21.htm">Acts 15:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-15.htm">2 Corinthians 3:15</a>). We see the beginning of reading the New Testament in the Christian assemblies in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-4.htm">Ephesians 3:4</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-16.htm">Colossians 4:16</a>; and generally in the fact of Epistles being addressed by the apostles to Churches. The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, the reader, lector, was a regular order in the third and fourth centuries (Bingham, vol. 1. p. 288). The Grace is being revived in our day. <span class="cmt_word">Exhortation</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>, where Barnabas's name is interpreted as meaning "<span class="accented">Son</span> of exhortation" (R.V.), and Acts 13:15; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-7.htm">Romans 12:7</a> (where, as here, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> are coupled together); <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:3</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Teaching</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>); almost always rendered "doctrine" in the A.V. But here, where <span class="accented">the act of teaching</span> (like the <span class="accented">act of reading</span>, the <span class="accented">act of exhorting</span>, in the two preceding clauses) is intended, "teaching" is perhaps the best word according to our modern usage. As regards the difference between <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, the former would express "<span class="accented">doctrinal</span> teaching," whether of dogma or of precept, the latter entreaties to believe the one and practice the other (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-23.htm">Acts 11:23</a> and Acts 14:22 for good examples of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:11-16 Men's youth will not be despised, if they keep from vanities and follies. Those who teach by their doctrine, must teach by their life. Their discourse must be edifying; their conversation must be holy; they must be examples of love to God and all good men, examples of spiritual-mindedness. Ministers must mind these things as their principal work and business. By this means their profiting will appear in all things, as well as to all persons; this is the way to profit in knowledge and grace, and also to profit others. The doctrine of a minister of Christ must be scriptural, clear, evangelical, and practical; well stated, explained, defended, and applied. But these duties leave no leisure for wordly pleasures, trifling visits, or idle conversation, and but little for what is mere amusement, and only ornamental. May every believer be enabled to let his profiting appear unto all men; seeking to experience the power of the gospel in his own soul, and to bring forth its fruits in his life.</body></html>
