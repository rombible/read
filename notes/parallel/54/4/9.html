Now we find one of these taken apparently from a Christian hymn, now from one of the public prayers or thanksgivings. The "faithful saying," in this instance, was that "godliness," that is, "active, living piety," is profitable for all things, seeing it has the promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="accented">Faithful is the saying</span> for <span class="accented">this is a faithful saying</span>, A.V.

What will it avail us to mortify the body, if we do not mortify sin? No diligence in mere outward things could be of much use. The gain of godliness lies much in the promise; and the promises to godly people relate partly to the life that now is, but especially to the life which is to come: though we lose for Christ, we shall not lose by him. If Christ be thus the Saviour of all men, then much more will he be the Rewarder of those who seek and serve him; he will provide well for those whom he has made new creatures.</body></html>
