We know that the promise made will be fulfilled, because the God on whom--as on a sure foundation--our hopes rest, is a <span class= "ital">living</span> God. "Living," in strong contrast to those dumb and lifeless idols shrined in the well-known Ephesian temples.<p><span class= "bld">Who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.</span>--These words, like the assertion of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-4.htm" title="Who will have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.">1Timothy 2:4</a>, have been often pressed into the service of that school of kindly, but mistaken, interpreters, who ignore, or explain away, the plain doctrine of Holy Scripture which tells us there are those whose destruction from the presence of the Lord shall be everlasting, whose portion shall be the "second death" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-9.htm" title="Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;">2Thessalonians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm" title="But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.">Revelation 21:8</a>). These interpreters prefer to substitute in place of this terrible, but <span class= "ital">repeated</span> declaration, their own perilous theories of universalism. Here the gracious words seem to affix a seal to the statement immediately preceding, which speaks of "the hope in the living God" as the source of all the labour and brave patience of the Lord's true servants. The <span class= "ital">living</span> God is also a <span class= "ital">loving</span> God, the Saviour of <span class= "ital">all, </span>if they would receive Him, and, undoubtedly, the Redeemer of those who accept His love and are faithful to His holy cause.<p>It must be borne in mind that there were many Hebrews still in every Christian congregation, many in every church, who still clung with passionate zeal to the old loved Hebrew thought, that Messiah's work of salvation was limited to the chosen race. This and similar sayings were specially meant to set aside for ever these narrow and selfish conceptions of the Redeemer's will; were intended to show these exclusive children of Israel that Christ's work would stretch over a greater and a grander platform than ever Israel could fill; were designed to tell out to all the churches how indeed "it was a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel." Still, with all these guarded considerations, which serve to warn us from entertaining any hopes of a universal redemption, such a saying as this seems to point to the blessed Atonement mystery as performing a work whose consequences reach far beyond the limits of human thought, or even of sober speculation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - To <span class="accented">this end</span> for <span class="accented">therefore</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">labor and strive</span> for <span class="accented">both labor and suffer reproach</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">have our hope set on</span> for <span class="accented">trust in</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">them</span> for <span class="accented">those</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">For to this end</span>; or, <span class="accented">with this in view</span>. He thus justifies his assertion that the saying he had quoted is a faithful one, by showing that the promise and all that it contained was the ground of all his labors and those of his fellow-laborers in the gospel. <span class="cmt_word">Strive</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>); so many good manuscripts, instead of T.R. <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>; but the reading is doubtful. The sense of the T.R., "suffer reproach," seems preferable, and the expression more forcible, as conveying something more than mere labor - the bitter reproaches and persecutions which he endured (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-11.htm">2 Timothy 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-9.htm">1 Corinthians 4:9-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-27</a>); and all because of his firm trust in the promises of the living God. <span class="cmt_word">Our hope set on.</span> Rather a clumsy phrase, though it expresses accurately the <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>; but it was hardly worth altering the A.V., "we trust in the living God." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-5.htm">1 Timothy 5:5</a> we have <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, with no appreciable difference of sense. <span class="cmt_word">Specially of them that believe</span>; and therefore we who believe have special cause to hope in him, and to trust his promises. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:6-10 Outward acts of self-denial profit little. What will it avail us to mortify the body, if we do not mortify sin? No diligence in mere outward things could be of much use. The gain of godliness lies much in the promise; and the promises to godly people relate partly to the life that now is, but especially to the life which is to come: though we lose for Christ, we shall not lose by him. If Christ be thus the Saviour of all men, then much more will he be the Rewarder of those who seek and serve him; he will provide well for those whom he has made new creatures.</body></html>
