Not a few, probably, in that Ephesian flock had been won over by the persuasive words of the false teachers to attribute a peculiar virtue to such practices--practices which, if persevered in, St. Paul well knew would tend to set up for imitation in the Church an unreal, unhealthy standard of life.<p><span class= "bld">Thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ.</span>--A high title to honour, this, "a good minister of Jesus Christ," and one Timothy would well earn if he would set himself in all earnestness to oppose and discredit the sickly teaching of the Ascetic school.<p>He would by such opposition, indeed, earn the "title to honour," for St. Paul well knew how great was the danger of a comparatively young and ardent disciple like Timothy being attracted by such mistaken teachings of perfection. But "the good minister of Jesus Christ" must teach "a life" which may be led by all, not by a select few merely, of the believers on his Master. Asceticism is too often a winning and attractive school of teaching to ministers, as, at a comparatively easy price, they win a great, but at the same time thoroughly unhealthy, power over the souls of men and women who practise these austerities, which tend necessarily to remove them out of the stream of active life.<p><span class= "bld">Nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine.</span>--The Greek present participle rendered here "nourished up in," marks a continuous and permanent process of self-education. It might be translated "ever training thyself"--a wise and never-to-be-forgotten precept of St. Paul's, this reminder to his own dear son in the faith, Timothy--and through Timothy to all Christian ministers of every age--never to relax their efforts for self-improvement. The education of the good minister of Jesus Christ is never to be considered finished. He--the teacher of others--must ever be striving himself after a higher and a yet higher knowledge in things spiritual.<p><span class= "bld">Whereunto thou hast attained.</span>--More accurately translated, <span class= "ital">which thou hast closely followed.</span> In the teaching respecting faith and practice which Timothy, as a disciple, has diligently followed out step by step--in that teaching he is to study to advance yet farther, so as to gain deeper and ever deeper knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="accented">Mind</span> for <span class="accented">remembrance</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Christ Jesus</span> for <span class="accented">Jesus Christ</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">nourished</span> for <span class="accented">nourished up</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the faith</span> for <span class="accented">faith</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the good</span> for <span class="accented">good</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">which thou hast followed until now</span> for <span class="accented">whereunto thou hast attained</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">If thou put the brethren in mind of these things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>); if thou <span class="accented">suggest</span> these things to the brethren, <span class="accented">lay them down as principles</span> upon which their conduct is to be based; or, <span class="accented">enjoin</span> them (Liddell and Scott). It only occurs in this metaphorical sense here in the New Testament, but is very common in classical Greek, and not infrequent in the LXX. It has often the meaning of "to advise" or" counsel." Of course, "hypothesis," the assumed basis from which you start, is the same root. <span class="accented">The brethren</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>).

A good minister (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). The application of this term to Timothy, <span class="accented">like</span> that of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> to presbyters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>), is an indication of the early date of the Epistle, before the distinctive names of the Church officers had quite hardened down into a technical meaning. <span class="cmt_word">Nourished</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); here only in the New Testament, and not used in the LXX.; but in classical Greek not uncommon in the sense of "brought up in," "trained in from childhood." In Latin, <span class="accented">innutritus</span>. The phrase, "nourished in the words of the faith," etc., explains the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and shows what a man must be to deserve the appellation - one, viz., who is nourished in the words of the faith, etc. <span class="cmt_word">The faith</span>; here again objective, as in ver. 6 (see note). <span class="cmt_word">The good doctrine</span>, etc. In opposition to the "doctrines of devils" in ver. 1.

Or, to put it differently, in one case so as to teach it identically, and in the other so as to know it perfectly. In this last aspect it is also used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3</a>. The classical use is "to follow closely any one's steps," or "the course of events," when used literally; or, metaphorically, "to follow with one's thoughts," "to understand." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:6-10 Outward acts of self-denial profit little. What will it avail us to mortify the body, if we do not mortify sin? No diligence in mere outward things could be of much use. The gain of godliness lies much in the promise; and the promises to godly people relate partly to the life that now is, but especially to the life which is to come: though we lose for Christ, we shall not lose by him. If Christ be thus the Saviour of all men, then much more will he be the Rewarder of those who seek and serve him; he will provide well for those whom he has made new creatures.</body></html>
