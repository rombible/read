Thus all food is sanctified, not only, or even chiefly, by the common formula of a Christian grace before meat. This too often degenerates into a mere form of words--into lip-service of the most heartless form--and is too often looked upon as a kind of religious charm. The sanctification referred to by St. Paul belongs to no one prayer or grace, but to the constant habit of referring everything to God as the giver of all--to the perpetual "office" of a devout heart which, taking everything as a gift from God, the lover and the friend of man, thanks God from the heart continually.<p>One, if not the oldest, form of a Christian grace before meat is the one found in the Apostolic Constitutions. It is very simple and beautiful, and perhaps not too long for daily use. It runs as follows: "Blessed be Thou, O Lord, who nourisheth men from very youth up, who givest meat to all flesh; fill our hearts with joy and gladness, so that we, always enjoying a sufficiency, may abound unto every good work in Christ Jesus our Lord, through whom be ascribed to Thee glory, honour, and power unto the ages.

Some refer to Gem 1:4, 10, 12, etc.; others to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-29.htm">Genesis 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>, as containing the original grant of meats for the use of man; others to the scriptural phrases embodied in the words of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, the prayer of thanksgiving. Another possible reference would be to the Word of God recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-13.htm">Acts 10:13, 15, 28</a>, by which that which had previously been unclean was now made clean or holy; or, lastly, it might mean "the blessing of God" given in answer to the "prayer" on each occasion, which suits well the present tense, <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Prayer</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-1.htm">1 Timothy 2:1</a>, note). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-5 The Holy Spirit, both in the Old and the New Testament, spoke of a general turning from the faith of Christ, and the pure worship of God. This should come during the Christian dispensation, for those are called the latter days. False teachers forbid as evil what God has allowed, and command as a duty what he has left indifferent. We find exercise for watchfulness and self-denial, in attending to the requirements of God's law, without being tasked to imaginary duties, which reject what he has allowed. But nothing justifies an intemperate or improper use of things; and nothing will be good to us, unless we seek by prayer for the Lord's blessing upon it.</body></html>
