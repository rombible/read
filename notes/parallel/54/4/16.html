The Apostle in these words sums up the two chief pastoral requisites, and then points out the mighty consequences which will result from faithfully carrying them out. The minister of Christ must keep his attention fixed on his own demeanour and conduct, and at the same time give equally careful heed to the quality and character of his teaching. This teaching must be true and manly, and, above all, it must be faithful in doctrine; and he himself must exemplify it in word and deed. <span class= "ital">Without</span> true and efficient teaching, the pure and upright life of the Christian pastor will fail to win souls for his Master; and, on the other hand, the most efficient instruction will be of no avail unless the life corresponds to the words publicly uttered.<p><span class= "bld">For in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.</span>--"Thou shalt save"--that is, in the great day of judgment; for only one meaning, and that the highest, must be given to "thou shalt save." Eternal happiness for pastor and flock is the double reward offered to the faithful servant of the Lord. In striving to save others, the minister is really caring for his own salvation.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="accented">To</span> for <span class="accented">unto</span>, A.V. (twice); <span class="accented">thy leaching</span> for <span class="accented">the doctrine</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">these things</span> for <span class="accented">them</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">save both</span> for <span class="accented">both sate</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Take heed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span>); as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-5.htm">Acts 3:5</a> (see too <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-7.htm">Luke 14:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thy teaching.</span> The A.V., <span class="accented">the doctrine</span>, is the better rendering, though the difference of meaning is very slight. The use of <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-1.htm">1 Timothy 6:1</a> and 3, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-10.htm">Titus 2:10</a> strongly supports the sense of "doctrine," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the thing taught (see note on ver. 13). <span class="cmt_word">Continue in these things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-43.htm">Acts 13:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-1.htm">Romans 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-22.htm">Romans 11:22, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>. It is impossible to give a satisfactory solution to the question - What does <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> refer to? It seems to me necessarily to refer to what <span class="accented">immediately</span> precedes, viz. <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>, and so to refer rather to the sense of the words than to the exact grammar. The things which he was to "take heed to" were his own conduct and example (included in <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>) an d the doctrine which he preached; and in a steady continuance in these things - faithful living and faithful teaching - he would save both himself and his hearers. The application of the words to the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> of ver. 15, or to all the things enumerated from ver. 12 onwards, or, taken as a masculine, to <span class="accented">the Ephesians</span>, or the <span class="accented">hearers</span>, as variously proposed by eminent commentators, seems alike impossible. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:11-16 Men's youth will not be despised, if they keep from vanities and follies. Those who teach by their doctrine, must teach by their life. Their discourse must be edifying; their conversation must be holy; they must be examples of love to God and all good men, examples of spiritual-mindedness. Ministers must mind these things as their principal work and business. By this means their profiting will appear in all things, as well as to all persons; this is the way to profit in knowledge and grace, and also to profit others. The doctrine of a minister of Christ must be scriptural, clear, evangelical, and practical; well stated, explained, defended, and applied. But these duties leave no leisure for wordly pleasures, trifling visits, or idle conversation, and but little for what is mere amusement, and only ornamental. May every believer be enabled to let his profiting appear unto all men; seeking to experience the power of the gospel in his own soul, and to bring forth its fruits in his life.</body></html>
