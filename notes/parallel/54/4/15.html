He must dwell on these things and must be diligent in their practice: he must show himself active and industrious as a public teacher, and must also order his life so as to be an example to his fellow-believers.<p><span class= "bld">Give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.</span>--More accurately rendered, <span class= "ital">thy advance</span> (or <span class= "ital">thy progress</span>)<span class= "ital"> may be manifest to all.</span> To these points--his public teaching and his public example--he must give ceaseless attention, that the Christian brotherhood of <span class= "ital">the</span> Church over which he presided should be enabled constantly to see what progress their chief pastor was making in Christian experience and life. The word we have translated "advance" or "progress" reminds Christian ministers and teachers of St. Paul's grave words to Timothy--and, through Timothy, to all occupying any position of authority in the congregations--that there must be no standing still, no resting content with knowledge already acquired, no being satisfied with the present spiritual life; there must be a restless striving after the acquirement of new stores of knowledge, ever deeper and more accurate; there must be a ceaseless endeavour to attain to a higher eminence in the spiritual life; and, if the minister or teacher would be successful, the <span class= "ital">result</span> of these efforts must be manifest to the brethren with whom his lot was cast.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="accented">Be diligent in</span> for <span class="accented">meditate upon</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">progress</span> for <span class="accented">profiting</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">be manifest unto</span> for <span class="accented">appear to</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Be diligent</span>, etc. (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>). Give all your attention and care and study to these things. It is just the contrary to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> in ver. 14. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span>, besides this passage, occurs in its classical sense of "premeditating" or "getting up a speech," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-11.htm">Mark 13:11</a> (where, however, the reading is doubtful), and again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-25.htm">Acts 4:25</a>, in the sense of "premeditating" certain actions. A kindred use in classical Greek is "to practice" or "exercise" an art, as rhetoric, dancing, shooting with a bow, and the like. It is very common in the LXX., in the sense of "meditating," practicing in the thoughts. <span class="cmt_word">Give thyself wholly to them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">be in these things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> be wholly and always occupied with them. The similar phrases in Greek and Latin classics are <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span> (Plutarch); "Omnis in hoc sum" (Her., 'Ep.,' 1:1. 1); "Nescio quid meditans nugarum, et totus in illis" (Her., 'Sat.,' 1. 9. 2); and in the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x1ff3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-17.htm">Proverbs 23:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thy progress</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;</span>). Progress, advance, or growth, is the idea of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;</span>. It is used twice in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12, 25</a>. A good example of its use in classical Greek is that in Polyb., 3:4, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f54;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. The use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> for "to advance," "make progress," is still more common (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a>; Galatians L 14; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-16.htm">2 Timothy 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-9.htm">2 Timothy 3:9, 14</a>).

Those who teach by their doctrine, must teach by their life. Their discourse must be edifying; their conversation must be holy; they must be examples of love to God and all good men, examples of spiritual-mindedness. Ministers must mind these things as their principal work and business. By this means their profiting will appear in all things, as well as to all persons; this is the way to profit in knowledge and grace, and also to profit others. The doctrine of a minister of Christ must be scriptural, clear, evangelical, and practical; well stated, explained, defended, and applied. But these duties leave no leisure for wordly pleasures, trifling visits, or idle conversation, and but little for what is mere amusement, and only ornamental. May every believer be enabled to let his profiting appear unto all men; seeking to experience the power of the gospel in his own soul, and to bring forth its fruits in his life.</body></html>
