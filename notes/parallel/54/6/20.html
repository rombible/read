The Epistle, no doubt dictated by the old man, was in the handwriting of some friend of St. Paul and the Church, who acted as his scribe; but, as seems to have been sometimes his habit (see especially the closing words of the Galatian Letter), the last pleading reminder was added by the hand of the Apostle himself. "O Timothy"--he writes now no longer addressing church or pastor, but his own favourite friend and pupil, the loved heir of his God-inspired traditions and maxims, which so faithfully represented the doctrine and teaching of Jesus of Nazareth--"O Timothy, keep the sacred trust committed to thy charge."<p>This "sacred trust," so solemnly committed as the parting charge to Timothy, was "the doctrine delivered by St. Paul to him to preach," the central point of which, we know from the Apostle's other writings, was the teaching respecting the atonement and the precious blood of Christ. There is a beautiful, though somewhat lengthened, paraphrase of the "Trust" in the <span class= "ital">Commonitorium</span> of Vincentius Lirinensis, composed about A.D. 430. "What is meant," he asks, "by '<span class= "ital">keep</span> the trust?' The disciple of St. Paul must keep the sound doctrine of his master safe from robbers and foes. . . . What is meant by 'the <span class= "ital">trust?</span>' Something intrusted to you to keep--not a possession you have discovered for yourself; something you have received from another--not what you have thought out for yourself . . . of this 'trust,' remember, you are nothing but the guardian. . . . What, then, is the meaning of '<span class= "ital">keep the trust?</span>' It is surely nothing else than 'guard the treasure of the Catholic faith.' . . . Gold have you received<span class= "ital">;</span> see that you hand gold on to others."<p>"Is there, then," asks this same wise writer "to be no progress, no development in religious teaching? Yes," he answers; "there should be a real progress, a marked development, but it must partake of the nature of a progress, not of a change. . . . Let religion in the soul follow the example of the growth of the various members which compose the body, and which, as years roll on, become ever stronger and more perfect, but which, notwithstanding their growth and developed beauty, always remain the same."<p><span class= "bld">Avoiding profane and vain babblings.</span>--The Apostle has before in this Epistle warned Timothy against these useless, profitless discussions. Anything like theological controversy and discussion seems to. have been distasteful to St. Paul, as tending to augment dissension and hatred, and to exalt into an undue prominence mere words and phrases.<p><span class= "bld">Oppositions of science falsely so called.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">of knowledge falsely so called.</span> These "oppositions" have been supposed by some to be a special allusion to some of the Gnostic theories of the opposition between the Law and the Gospel, of which peculiar school, later, Marcion was the great teacher. It is hardly likely that any <span class= "ital">definite</span> Gnostic teaching had as yet been heard in Ephesus, but there is little doubt that the seeds of much of the Gnosticism of the next century were--when St. Paul wrote to Timothy--being then sown in some of the Jewish schools of Ephesus and the neighbouring cities. (Comp. the allusions to these Jewish and cabalistic schools in St. Paul's letter to the Colossian Church.) The "oppositions" here may be understood as referring generally to the theories of the false teachers, who were undermining the doctrine of St. Paul as taught by Timothy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="accented">Guard</span> for <span class="accented">keep</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">unto thee</span> for <span class="accented">to thy trust</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">turning away from</span> for <span class="accented">avoiding</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the profane</span> for <span class="accented">profane and vain</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the knowledge which is falsely</span> for <span class="accented">science</span>, <span class="accented">falsely</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Guard that which is committed unto thee</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, T.R.). <span class="accented">Guard</span> for <span class="accented">keep</span> is hardly an improvement. The meaning of "keep," like that of <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, is <span class="accented">to guard</span>, <span class="accented">keep watch over</span>, and, by so doing, <span class="accented">to preserve</span> safe and uninjured. This meaning is well brought out in the familiar words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121.htm">Psalm 121</a>, "He that keepeth thee will not slumber.... He that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord himself is thy Keeper" (so too <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a>, etc.). <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-12.htm">2 Timothy 1:12, 14</a>, where the apostle uses it (in ver. 12) of his own soul, which he has committed to the safe and faithful keeping of the Lord Jesus Christ; but in ver. 14 in the same sense as here. "That good thing which was committed unto thee guard ['keep,' A.V.]." There does not seem to be any difference between <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, which both mean "a deposit," and are used indifferently in classical Greek, though the latter is the more common. The precept to Timothy here is to keep diligent and watchful guard over the faith committed to his trust; to preserve it unaltered and uncorrupt, so as to hand it down to his successors exactly the same as he had received it. Oh that the successors of the apostles had always kept this precept (see Ordination of Priests)! <span class="cmt_word">Turning away from</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); only here in the middle voice, "turning from," "avoiding," with a transitive sense. In the passive voice it means "to turn out of the path," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-6.htm">1 Timothy 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-15.htm">1 Timothy 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-4.htm">2 Timothy 4:4</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The profane babblings</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-7.htm">1 Timothy 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-16.htm">2 Timothy 2:16</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>; only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-16.htm">2 Timothy 2:16</a>, "the utterance of empty words," "words of the lips" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-20.htm">2 Kings 18:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Oppositions</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>); here only in the New Testament. It is a term used in logic and in rhetoric by Plato, Aristotle, etc., for "oppositions" and "antitheses," laying one doctrine by the side of another for comparison, or contrast, or refutation. It seems to allude to the particular method used by the heretics to establish their tenets, in opposition to the statements of the Church on particular points - such as the Law, the Resurrection, etc. <span class="cmt_word">The knowledge which is falsely so called.</span> There is a very similar intimation of the growth of an empty philosophy, whose teaching was antagonistic to the teaching of Christ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>, and with which St. Paul contrasts the true <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 3. This was clearly the germ (called by Bishop Lightfoot "Gnostic Judaism") of what was later more fully developed as the <span class="accented">Gnostic</span> heresy, which, of course, derived its name from <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, knowledge or science, to which they laid claim (see Bishop Lightfoot's able 'Introduction to the Epistle to Colossians,' specially p. 100; and his notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-8.htm">1 Timothy 2:8</a>, <span class="accented">sqq</span>.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:17-21 Being rich in this world is wholly different from being rich towards God. Nothing is more uncertain than worldly wealth. Those who are rich, must see that God gives them their riches; and he only can give to enjoy them richly; for many have riches, but enjoy them poorly, not having a heart to use them. What is the best estate worth, more than as it gives opportunity of doing the more good? Showing faith in Christ by fruits of love, let us lay hold on eternal life, when the self-indulgent, covetous, and ungodly around, lift up their eyes in torment. That learning which opposes the truth of the gospel, is not true science, or real knowledge, or it would approve the gospel, and consent to it. Those who advance reason above faith, are in danger of leaving faith. Grace includes all that is good, and grace is an earnest, a beginning of glory; wherever God gives grace, he will give glory.</body></html>
