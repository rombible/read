The true Christian teaching is healthy, practical, capable of being carried out by all orders in the state, by every age or sex, by bond and free. The spurious Christian maxims of these men deal with subtle, useless, unpractical questions, which have no influence on ordinary life, and only tend to stir up strife and useless inquiry, and to make men discontented and rebellious. These unhappy men he first characterises as "proud:" literally, <span class= "ital">blinded with pride.</span><p><span class= "bld">Knowing nothing.</span>--Better rendered, <span class= "ital">yet without knowing anything;</span> having no real conception of the office and work of Christ in the world.<p><span class= "bld">But doting about questions.</span>--While so ignorant of the higher and more practical points of Christian theology, the false teacher is "mad upon" curious and debatable questions, such as the nature of the ever blessed Trinity; God's purposes respecting those men who know not, have not even heard of the Redeemer; and the like--problems never to be solved by us while on earth--questions, the profitless debating of which has rent asunder whole churches, and individually has broken up old friendships, and sown the seeds of bitter irreconcilable hatred.<p><span class= "bld">And strifes of words.</span>--Verbal disputes, barren and idle controversies about words rather than things; such wild war as also has raged, not only in the days of Timothy and of St. Paul, but all through the Christian ages, on such words as Predestination, Election, Faith, Inspiration, Person, Regeneration, &c.<p>St. Paul was writing, then, in the spirit of the living God, and was warning no solitary pastor and friend at Ephesus of the weeds then springing up in that fair, newly-planted vineyard of his, but was addressing the Master's servants in many vineyards and of many ages; was telling them what would meet them, what would mar and spoil their work, and in not a few cases would break their hearts with sorrow.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="accented">Puffed up</span> for <span class="accented">proud</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">questionings</span> for <span class="accented">questions</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">disputes</span> for <span class="accented">strifes</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">He is puffed up</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-6.htm">1 Timothy 3:6</a>, note.

Applied in classical Greek to the mind and body, "to be in an unsound state." Here it means "having a morbid love of" or "going mad about." In this morbid love of questionings and disputes of words, they lose sight of all wholesome words and all godly doctrine. <span class="cmt_word">Questionings</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-6.htm">1 Timothy 1:6</a>, note.

In classical Greek it means "suspicion," or any under-thought. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> occurs three times in the Acts - "to deem, think, or suppose." Here the "surmisings" are those uncharitable insinuations in which angry controversialists indulge towards one another. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-5 Christians were not to suppose that religious knowledge, or Christian privileges, gave them any right to despise heathen masters, or to disobey lawful commands, or to expose their faults to others. And such as enjoyed the privilege of living with believing masters, were not to withhold due respect and reverence, because they were equal in respect to religious privileges, but were to serve with double diligence and cheerfulness, because of their faith in Christ, and as partakers of his free salvation. We are not to consent to any words as wholesome, except the words of our Lord Jesus Christ; to these we must give unfeigned consent. Commonly those are most proud who know least; for they do not know themselves. Hence come envy, strife, railings, evil-surmisings, disputes that are all subtlety, and of no solidity, between men of corrupt and carnal minds, ignorant of the truth and its sanctifying power, and seeking their worldly advantage.</body></html>
