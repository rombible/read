(Comp. our Lord's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-9.htm" title="And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when you fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.">Luke 16:9</a>, where the same truth is taught, and a similar promise made.)<p>Here a simple command, in complete accordance with the teaching: of Christ, is given, and a definite consequence is attached to the obeying the command. If the "rich"--the word "rich," we must remember, is a broad term, and in St. Paul's mind would comprehend many a one who would hesitate to apply the term in its strict sense to himself--if the "rich," or the comparatively rich, are really generous and kind with their wealth--and of this God alone can be judge--then with these perishable, fleeting riches they are laying the foundation of an everlasting habitation on the other side the veil. Bengel quaintly expresses the truth, slightly changing the metaphor--"<span class= "ital">Mercator, naufragio</span> <span class= "ital">salvus, thesauros domum praemissos invenit.</span>"<p><span class= "bld">That they may lay hold on eternal life.</span>--The older authorities here, instead of "eternal," read <span class= "ital">truly.</span> The sentence will then read thus, <span class= "ital">that they may lay hold on that which is truly life</span>--that is, may lay hold on that which <span class= "ital">in truth</span> deserves the name "life," because the fear of death will no longer cast its gloomy shadow over it. This "laying hold on eternal life" is <span class= "ital">the end</span> the wise rich Christian proposes to himself, when he orders his earthly life and administers his earthly goods, and St. Paul has just showed Timothy how this "end" is to be reached by such a man.<p>Such plain statements in the Book of Life as the foregoing by no means weaken the divine truth so often repeated, that men are saved only by the blood of Christ, with which they must sprinkle their sin scarred souls. Poor men and rich men alike may try; they will find, with all their brave struggles, that of <span class= "ital">themselves</span> they will never win salvation, they <span class= "ital">cannot</span> redeem their souls.<p>But such plain statements as we have here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-9.htm" title="And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when you fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.">Luke 16:9</a>, tell us, if we really are "of Christ's," sprinkled with His precious blood, then we must try with heart and soul, with hand and brain, to follow out such charges as we have just been discussing.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="accented">The life which is life indeed</span> for <span class="accented">eternal life</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Laying up in store</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); only here in the New Testament, but once in Wisd. 3:3, and occasionally in classical Greek. <span class="cmt_word">A good foundation</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>). The idea of a <span class="accented">foundation</span> is always maintained in the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, whether it is used literally or figuratively (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-48.htm">Luke 11:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-14.htm">Revelation 21:14</a>, etc.). There is, at first sight, a manifest confusion of metaphors in the phrase, "laying up in store a foundation." Bishop Ellicott, following Wiesinger, understands "a wealth of good works as a foundation." Alford sees no difficulty in considering the "foundation" us a treasure. Others have conjectured <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "a stored treasure," for <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Others understand <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, a deposit. Others take <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in the sense of "acquiring," without reference to its etymology. But this is unlikely, the context being about the use of money, though in part favored by the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-7.htm">2 Peter 3:7</a>. The reader must choose for himself either to adopt one of the above explanations, or to credit St. Paul with an unimportant confusion of metaphors. Anyhow, the doctrine is clear that wealth spent for God and his Church is repaid with interest, and becomes an abiding treasure. <span class="cmt_word">Life indeed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>); so <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-3.htm">1 Timothy 5:3, 5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, "widows indeed;" and (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>) <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "free indeed," in opposition to the freedom which the Jews claimed as the seed of Abraham. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:17-21 Being rich in this world is wholly different from being rich towards God. Nothing is more uncertain than worldly wealth. Those who are rich, must see that God gives them their riches; and he only can give to enjoy them richly; for many have riches, but enjoy them poorly, not having a heart to use them. What is the best estate worth, more than as it gives opportunity of doing the more good? Showing faith in Christ by fruits of love, let us lay hold on eternal life, when the self-indulgent, covetous, and ungodly around, lift up their eyes in torment. That learning which opposes the truth of the gospel, is not true science, or real knowledge, or it would approve the gospel, and consent to it. Those who advance reason above faith, are in danger of leaving faith. Grace includes all that is good, and grace is an earnest, a beginning of glory; wherever God gives grace, he will give glory.</body></html>
