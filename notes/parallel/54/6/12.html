So run, that you may obtain.">1Corinthians 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/3-13.htm" title="Brothers, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth to those things which are before,">Philippians 3:13-14</a>)--the metaphor St. Paul loved so well, and which Timothy must have heard so often from his old master's lips as he preached and taught--he bids the "man of God," rising above the pitiful struggles for things perishable and useless, fight the noble fight of faith; bids him strive to lay hold of the <span class= "ital">real</span> prize--life eternal. The emphasis rests here mainly on the words "the good fight" and "eternal life." These things are placed in strong contrast with "the struggle of the covetous" and its "miserable, perishable crown." "The good fight," more closely considered, is the contest and struggle which the Christian has to maintain against the world, the flesh, and the devil. It is styled the "good fight of faith," partly because the contest is waged on behalf of, for the sake of, the faith, but still more because from faith it derives its strength and draws its courage. "Eternal life" is the prize the "man of God" must ever have before his eyes. It is the crown of life which the Judge of quick and dead will give to the "faithful unto death." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-12.htm" title="Blessed is the man that endures temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him.">James 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-10.htm" title="Fear none of those things which you shall suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried; and you shall have tribulation ten days: be you faithful to death, and I will give you a crown of life.">Revelation 2:10</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Whereunto thou art also called.</span>--The "calling" here refers both to the inner and outward call to the Master's work. The inner call is the persuasion in the heart that the one vocation to which the life must be dedicated was the ministry of the word; and the outward call is the summons by St. Paul, ratified by the church in the persons of the presbyters of Lystra.<p><span class= "bld">And hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.</span>--More accurately translated, <span class= "ital">and</span> <span class= "ital">thou confessedst the good confession</span> . . . These words simply add to the foregoing clause another ground of exhortation: "Thou wast called to eternal life, and thou madest the good confession." When--has been asked--was this good confession made? Several epochs in the life of Timothy have been suggested. Were it not for the difficulty of fixing a date for so terrible an experience in Timothy's, comparatively speaking, short life, it would appear most probable that the confession was made on the occasion of some persecution or bitter trial to which he had been exposed. On the whole, however, it appears safer to refer "the good confession" to the time of his ordination. In this case the many witnesses would refer to the presbyters and others who were present at the solemn rite.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="accented">The faith</span> for <span class="accented">faith</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the life eternal</span> for <span class="accented">eternal life</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">wast</span> for <span class="accented">art also</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">didst confess the good confession</span> for <span class="accented">hast professed a good profession</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">in the sight of</span> for <span class="accented">before</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Fight the good fight</span>. This is not quite a happy rendering. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> is the "contest" at the Olympic assembly for any of the prizes, in wrestling, chariot-racing, foot-racing, music, or what not. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> is to "carry on such a contest" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>). The comparison is different from that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-18.htm">1 Timothy 1:18</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f3d;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x1fc3;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>," That thou mayest war the good warfare." <span class="cmt_word">The faith.</span> There is nothing to determine absolutely whether <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> here means faith <span class="accented">subjectively</span> or "the faith" objectively, nor does it much matter. The result is the same; but the subjective sense seems the most appropriate. <span class="cmt_word">Lay hold,</span> etc.; as the <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> or prize of the contest (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24, 25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whereunto thou wast called.</span> So St. Paul continually (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1, 6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-29.htm">1 Corinthians 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>; and numerous other passages). He seems here to drop the metaphor, as in the following clause. <span class="cmt_word">Didst confess the good confession.</span> The connection of this phrase with the call to eternal life, and the allusion to one special occasion on which Timothy "had confessed the good confession" of his faith in Jesus Christ, seems to point clearly to his baptism (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-42.htm">John 12:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a>). The phrase, "the good confession," seems to have been technically applied to the baptismal confession of Christ (compare the other Church sayings, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-15.htm">1 Timothy 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-1.htm">1 Timothy 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-9.htm">1 Timothy 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-11.htm">2 Timothy 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-8.htm">Titus 3:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the sight of many witnesses.</span> The whole congregation of the Church, who were witnesses of his baptism (see the rubric prefixed to the Order of "Ministration of Public Baptism" in the Book of Common Prayer). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:11-16 It ill becomes any men, but especially men of God, to set their hearts upon the things of this world; men of God should be taken up with the things of God. There must be a conflict with corruption, and temptations, and the powers of darkness. Eternal life is the crown proposed for our encouragement. We are called to lay hold thereon. To the rich must especially be pointed out their dangers and duties, as to the proper use of wealth. But who can give such a charge, that is not himself above the love of things that wealth can buy? The appearing of Christ is certain, but it is not for us to know the time. Mortal eyes cannot bear the brightness of the Divine glory. None can approach him except as he is made known unto sinners in and by Christ. The Godhead is here adored without distinction of Persons, as all these things are properly spoken, whether of the Father, the Son, or the Holy Ghost. God is revealed to us, only in and through the human nature of Christ, as the only begotten Son of the Father.</body></html>
