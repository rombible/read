It depended on the unknown and mysterious counsels of the Most High. The impression left upon our minds by the words of this and the preceding verse is that St. Paul had given up all hope of living himself to see the dawn of that awful day, but he deemed it more than probable that his son in the faith would live to witness it. Hence his words to him: "Keep the commandment without spot <span class= "ital">until</span> the Epiphany of our Lord Jesus Christ."<p><span class= "bld">Who is the blessed and only Potentate.</span>--The stately and rhythmical doxology with which the solemn charge to Timothy is closed was not improbably taken from a hymn loved by the Ephesian Christians, and often sung in their churches; the words, then, were, likely enough, familiar to Timothy and his people, though now receiving a new and deeper meaning than before. Well might Timothy, as example to the flock of Ephesus, keep "the commandment without spot, unrebukeable"--fearlessly, even though danger and death were presented before him as the sure reward of his faithfulness--for He who in His own times should reveal (show) the Lord Jesus returning to earth in glory, was inconceivably greater and grander than any earthly potentate, king, or lord, before whose little throne Timothy might have to stand and be judged for his faithfulness to the "only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords."<p>Of the first of these sublime titles, God is termed "the blessed," or <span class= "ital">the happy, </span>because He is the source of all blessedness and happiness; and the "only Potentate," in solemn assertion that the Christian's God was One, and that to none save to Him could this appellation "only Potentate" be applied. Possibly already in Ephesus the teachers of Gnosticism had begun their unhappy work--with their fables of the mighty aeons, and their strange Eastern conception of one God the source of good, and another the source of evil.<p><span class= "bld">The King of kings, and Lord of lords.</span>--God is king over those men style kings, and lord over all men call lords here.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="accented">Its own</span> for <span class="accented">his</span>, A.V. This correction seems to be manifestly right. The same phrase is rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-3.htm">Titus 1:3</a> "in due time," in the A.V.; but in the R.V. 2:6 is "its own times," and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-3.htm">Titus 1:3</a> "his own seasons. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span> is also rendered "in due season," in both the A.V. and the R.V. Such a phrase as <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> must be taken everywhere in the same sense. It clearly means at the <span class="accented">fitting</span> or <span class="accented">proper</span> time, and corresponds to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "the fullness of time," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>. The two ideas are combined in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-20.htm">Luke 1:20</a> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) and Luke 21:24 (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall show</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "to show an appearing," is a somewhat unusual phrase, and is more classical than scriptural. The verb and the object are not of cognate sense (as "to display a display," or "to manifest a manifestation"), but the invisible God, God the Father, will, it is said, display the Epiphany of our Lord Jesus Christ. The wonder displayed and manifested to the world is the appearing of Christ in his glory. The Author of that manifestation is God. <span class="cmt_word">The blessed</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (not <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-61.htm">Mark 14:61</a>), is only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-11.htm">1 Timothy 1:11</a> (where see note) applied to God in Scripture. <span class="cmt_word">The blessed and only Potentate.</span> The phrase is a remarkable one. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> (Potentate), which is only found elsewhere in the New Testament in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-27.htm">Acts 8:27</a>, is applied to God here only. It is, however, so applied in 2 Macc. 3:24 2Macc. 12:15 2Macc. 15:23, where we have <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x393;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f67;&#x1fc0;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>; in all which places, as here, the phrase is used to signify, by way of contrast, the superiority of the power of God over all earthly power. In the first of the above-cited passages the language is singularly like that here used by St. Paul. For it is said that <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "the Prince (or Potentate) of all power made a great apparition," or "appearing" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>), for the overthrow of the blasphemer and persecutor Heliodorus. St. Paul must have had this in his mind, and compared the effect of "the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ," in overthrowing the Neros of the earth with the overthrow of Heliodorus (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:7-10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">King of kings, and Lord of lords</span>, etc. (compare the slightly different phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a> and Revelation 19:16, applied to the Son). So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-2.htm">Psalm 136:2, 3</a>, God is spoken of as "God of gods, and Lord of lords." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:11-16 It ill becomes any men, but especially men of God, to set their hearts upon the things of this world; men of God should be taken up with the things of God. There must be a conflict with corruption, and temptations, and the powers of darkness. Eternal life is the crown proposed for our encouragement. We are called to lay hold thereon. To the rich must especially be pointed out their dangers and duties, as to the proper use of wealth. But who can give such a charge, that is not himself above the love of things that wealth can buy? The appearing of Christ is certain, but it is not for us to know the time. Mortal eyes cannot bear the brightness of the Divine glory. None can approach him except as he is made known unto sinners in and by Christ. The Godhead is here adored without distinction of Persons, as all these things are properly spoken, whether of the Father, the Son, or the Holy Ghost. God is revealed to us, only in and through the human nature of Christ, as the only begotten Son of the Father.</body></html>
