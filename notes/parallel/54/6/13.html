So he charges him as in the tremendous presence of God.<p><span class= "bld">Who quickeneth all things.</span>--The older authorities adopt here a reading which implies, <span class= "ital">who keepest</span> <span class= "ital">alive, </span>or <span class= "ital">preservest, all things.</span> The Preserver rather than the Creator is here brought into prominence. Timothy is exhorted to fight his good fight, ever mindful that he is in the presence of that great Being who could and would--even if Timothy's faithfulness should lead him to danger and to death--still preserve him, on earth or in Paradise.<p><span class= "bld">And before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession.</span>--Better rendered, <span class= "ital">who before Pontius Pilate bore witness to</span> <span class= "ital">the good confession.</span> The good confession which (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-12.htm" title="Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto you are also called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.">1Timothy 6:12</a>) Timothy confessed before many witnesses, Jesus Christ, in the presence of Pilate, had already borne witness to. In other words, Jesus Christ, before Pontius Pilate, bore witness by His own solemn words, that He was the Messiah--the long-looked-for King of Israel. If the preposition which we have, with the majority of expositors, construed "before" (Pontius Pilate) have here its local meaning, the "<span class= "ital">witness</span>" must be limited to the scene in the Judgment Hall--to the interview between the prisoner Jesus and the Roman governor.<p>Although this meaning here seems the most accurate, it is possible to understand this preposition in a <span class= "ital">temporal, </span>not in a local, signification--<span class= "ital">under</span> (that is, <span class= "ital">in the days of</span>) Pontius Pilate--then the "witness" was borne by the Redeemer to the fact of His being "Messiah:" first, by His own solemn words; secondly, by His voluntary death. The confession was that "He, Jesus, was a King, though not of this world." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-11.htm" title="And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Are you the King of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, You say.">Matthew 27:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/18-36.htm" title="Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.">John 18:36-37</a>, where the noble confession is detailed.) He bore His witness with a terrible death awaiting Him. It was, in some respects, a model confession for all martyrs, in so far as it was a bold confession of the truth with the sentence of death before His eyes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="accented">I charge thee</span> for <span class="accented">I give thee charge</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">of</span> for <span class="accented">before</span> (in italics), A.V.; <span class="accented">the</span> for a, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">I charge thee</span>. It has been well observed that the apostle's language increases in solemnity as he approaches the end of the Epistle. This word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> is of frequent use in St. Paul's Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-10.htm">1 Corinthians 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:11</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:4, 6, 10, 12</a>; and above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3.htm">1 Timothy 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-11.htm">1 Timothy 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-7.htm">1 Timothy 5:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the sight of God</span>, etc. (compare the adjuration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-21.htm">1 Timothy 5:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who quickeneth</span>, etc. The T.R. has <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>.

Both words are used in the LXX. as the rendering of the Pihel and Hiphil of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. As an epithet of "<span class="accented">God</span>," it sets before us the highest creative act of the Almighty as "the Lord, and the Giver of life;" and is equivalent to "the living God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a>), "the God of the spirits of all flesh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-22.htm">Numbers 16:22</a>). The existence of "life" is the one thing which baffles the ingenuity of science in its attempts to dispense with a Creator. <span class="cmt_word">The good confession</span> refers to our Lord's confession of himself as "<span class="accented">the</span> Christ, the Son of <span class="accented">God</span>," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-11.htm">Matthew 27:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-3.htm">Luke 23:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36, 37</a>, which is analogous to the baptismal confession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-37.htm">Acts 8:37</a> (T.R.); 16:31; 19:4, 5). The natural word to have followed <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> was <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, as above <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> follows <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>; but St. Paul substitutes the word of cognate meaning, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, in order to keep the formula, <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:11-16 It ill becomes any men, but especially men of God, to set their hearts upon the things of this world; men of God should be taken up with the things of God. There must be a conflict with corruption, and temptations, and the powers of darkness. Eternal life is the crown proposed for our encouragement. We are called to lay hold thereon. To the rich must especially be pointed out their dangers and duties, as to the proper use of wealth. But who can give such a charge, that is not himself above the love of things that wealth can buy? The appearing of Christ is certain, but it is not for us to know the time. Mortal eyes cannot bear the brightness of the Divine glory. None can approach him except as he is made known unto sinners in and by Christ. The Godhead is here adored without distinction of Persons, as all these things are properly spoken, whether of the Father, the Son, or the Holy Ghost. God is revealed to us, only in and through the human nature of Christ, as the only begotten Son of the Father.</body></html>
