(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-11.htm" title="Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.">Titus 1:11</a>.) St. Paul, here adding his command to Timothy to have no dealings with these men, dismisses the subject with these few scathing words of scorn and contempt. One can imagine with what feelings of holy anger one like the noble chivalrous St. Paul would regard the conduct of men who looked upon the profession of the religion of the Crucified as a source of gain. This was by far the gravest of his public charges against these teachers of a strange and novel Christianity. We read elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/3-12.htm" title="Now if any man build on this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;">1Corinthians 3:12-15</a>) men might go wrong in doctrine, might even teach an unpractical, useless religion, if only they were trying their poor best to build on the one foundation--Christ. Their faulty work would perish, but they would assuredly find mercy if only they were in earnest, if only they were zeal. But <span class= "ital">these, </span>St. Paul tells Timothy and his church, were not in <span class= "ital">earnest;</span> these were <span class= "ital">unreal.</span> Their religion--they traded upon it. Their teaching--they taught only to win gold. There was another school of teaching--he had just been dwelling on it--<span class= "ital">the</span> teaching which told men, even slaves, simply, lovingly to do their duty as though ever in the presence of the Lord, without any restless longing for change. This teaching would win souls to Christ, but it would never win gold, or popular applause, or gain, as the world counts gain.<p><span class= "bld">From such withdraw thyself.</span>--Most, though not all, the ancient authorities omit these words.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="accented">Wranglings</span> for <span class="accented">perverse disputings</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">corrupted in mind</span> for <span class="accented">of corrupt minds</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">bereft</span> for <span class="accented">destitute</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">godliness is a way of gain</span> for <span class="accented">gain is godliness</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Wranglings</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, <span class="accented">R</span>.<span class="accented">T</span>.; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, T.R.).

Hence <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;</span> (which is only found here) means "continued wranglings." The substantive <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;</span> (English <span class="accented">diatribe</span>) means, among other things, a "discussion" or "argument." The addition of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> gives the sense of a "perverse discussion," or "<span class="accented">disputing</span>." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Bereft</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). The difference between the A.V. "destitute" and the R.V. "<span class="accented">bereft"</span> is that the latter implies that they once had possession of the truth, but had lost it by their own fault. They had fallen away from the truth, and were twice dead. <span class="cmt_word">Godliness is a way of gain.</span> The A.V., <span class="accented">that gain is godliness</span>, is clearly wrong, utterly confusing the subject with the predicate, and so destroying the connection between the clause and ver. 6. <span class="cmt_word">A way of gain</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); only here and in ver. 6 in the New Testament. but found in Wisd. 13:19 Wisd. 14:2; Polybius, etc. It signifies "a source of gain," "<span class="accented">a</span> means of malting money," or, in one word, "a trade." The same charge is brought against the heretical teachers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-11.htm">Titus 1:11</a>). The cause in the A.V. and T.R., <span class="accented">from such withdraw thyself</span>, is not in the R.T. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-5 Christians were not to suppose that religious knowledge, or Christian privileges, gave them any right to despise heathen masters, or to disobey lawful commands, or to expose their faults to others. And such as enjoyed the privilege of living with believing masters, were not to withhold due respect and reverence, because they were equal in respect to religious privileges, but were to serve with double diligence and cheerfulness, because of their faith in Christ, and as partakers of his free salvation. We are not to consent to any words as wholesome, except the words of our Lord Jesus Christ; to these we must give unfeigned consent. Commonly those are most proud who know least; for they do not know themselves. Hence come envy, strife, railings, evil-surmisings, disputes that are all subtlety, and of no solidity, between men of corrupt and carnal minds, ignorant of the truth and its sanctifying power, and seeking their worldly advantage.</body></html>
