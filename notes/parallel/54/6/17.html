From this fatal snare he warned the "man of God" to flee, bidding him take courage in the high service to which he was dedicated, and to be fearless of all consequences, for he served the King of kings. But in the congregations of Ephesus there were many, owing to birth or to other circumstances, already rich and powerful, already in the possession of gold and rank, in varied degrees. Before closing the letter to the chief pastor, Timothy, he must add a word of encouragement and also of special warning to these. Above all things he would have no mistake as to his meaning: the <span class= "ital">wish to be rich</span> was a sure root of error and of evil, but the <span class= "ital">being rich</span> was a very different thing; this class was surrounded, indeed, with special perils, but still, even "<span class= "ital">as rich"</span> they might serve God faithfully. So in his charge to them he commands them not to strip themselves of their wealth, but to use it wisely, generously.<p><span class= "bld">In this world.</span>--The Greek word rendered "world" signifies, in its literal sense, <span class= "ital">age, </span>and includes the period which closes with the second coming of the Lord. Now, as St; Paul had just made a reference to the probable speedy coming of the Lord in judgment in Timothy's lifetime, the words "the rich in this world" have a special signification. Very fleeting indeed will be those riches of which their possessors were so foolishly proud [be not high-minded, St. Paul urges]; these riches were a possession always terminable with life--possibly, let them bear in mind, much sooner.<p><span class= "bld">Nor trust in uncertain riches.</span>--The literal translation of the Greek here is more forcible--"nor trust in the uncertainty of riches." Uncertainty--for (1) the very duration of life, even for a day, is uncertain; and (2) the numberless accidents of life--in war, for instance, and commerce--are perpetually reminding us of the shifting nature of these earthly possessions.<p><span class= "bld">But in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy.</span>--The Greek word rendered "living" does not occur in the more ancient authorities. Its removal from the text in nowise alters the sense of the passage. The rich should set their affections and place their trust, not in these uncertain riches, but in God, the bestower of them, who wills, too, that His creatures should find pleasure in these His gifts--given to us to enjoy.<p>This is another of the many sayings of the old man St. Paul, in which he urges on the people of God, that their kind Master in heaven not only allows men reasonable pleasures and gratifications, but even Himself abundantly provides such for them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="accented">This present</span> for <span class="accented">this</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">have their hope set on the uncertainty of</span> for <span class="accented">trust in uncertain</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">on</span> <span class="accented">God</span> for <span class="accented">in the living God</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Charge</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;</span>); as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-11.htm">1 Timothy 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-7.htm">1 Timothy 5:7</a>; and in ver. 13, and elsewhere frequently. <span class="cmt_word">Rich in this present world.</span> Had St. Paul in his mind the parable of Dives and Lazarus (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19, 25</a>)? <span class="cmt_word">That they be not high-minded</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>); elsewhere only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-20.htm">Romans 11:20</a>. The words compounded with <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> have mostly a bad sense - "haughtiness," "boastfulness," and the like. <span class="cmt_word">The uncertainty</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>); here only in the New Testament, but used in the same sense in Polybius (see <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-8.htm">1 Corinthians 14:8</a>; and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-6.htm">1 Corinthians 9:6</a>). The A.V., though less literal, expresses the sense much better than the R.V., which is hardly good English. <span class="cmt_word">Who giveth us richly all things to enjoy</span>; for enjoyment. The gifts are God's. Trust, therefore, in the Giver, not in the gift. The gift is uncertain; the Giver liveth forever.

Nothing is more uncertain than worldly wealth. Those who are rich, must see that God gives them their riches; and he only can give to enjoy them richly; for many have riches, but enjoy them poorly, not having a heart to use them. What is the best estate worth, more than as it gives opportunity of doing the more good? Showing faith in Christ by fruits of love, let us lay hold on eternal life, when the self-indulgent, covetous, and ungodly around, lift up their eyes in torment. That learning which opposes the truth of the gospel, is not true science, or real knowledge, or it would approve the gospel, and consent to it. Those who advance reason above faith, are in danger of leaving faith. Grace includes all that is good, and grace is an earnest, a beginning of glory; wherever God gives grace, he will give glory.</body></html>
