It entered into all grades and ranks. It was common to all peoples and nations. The very fabric of society seemed knit and bound together by this miserable institution. War and commerce were equally responsible for slavery in the Old World. To attempt to uproot it--to preach against it--to represent it in public teaching as hateful to God, shameful to man--would have been to preach and to teach rebellion and revolution in its darkest and most violent form. It was indeed the curse of the world; but the Master and His chosen servants took their own course and their own time to clear it away. Jesus Christ and His disciples, such as St. Paul and St. John, left society as they found it, uprooting no ancient landmarks, alarming no ancient prejudices, content to live in the world as it was, and to do its work as they found it--trusting, by a new and lovely example, slowly and surely to raise men to a higher level, knowing well that at last, by force of unselfishness, loving self-denial, brave patience, the old curses--such as slavery--would be driven from the world. Surely the result, so far, has not disappointed the hopes of the first teachers of Christianity.<p>This curse at least is disappearing fast from the face of the globe. St. Paul here is addressing, in the first place, Christian slaves of a Pagan master. Let these, if they love the Lord and would do honour to His holy teaching, in their relations to their earthly masters not presume upon their new knowledge, that with the Master in Heaven "there was no respect of persons;" that "in Jesus Christ there was neither bond nor free, for all were one in Christ." Let these not dream for an instant that Christianity was to interfere with the existing social relations, and to put master and slave on an equality on earth. Let these, by their conduct to unbelieving masters, paying them all loving respect and honour, show how the new religion was teaching them to live.<p><span class= "bld">That the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.</span>--There would indeed be a grave danger of this, if the many Christian slaves, instead of showing increased zeal for their masters' service, should, as the result of the teaching of the new society they had joined, become morose, impatient of servitude, rebellious. Very soon in Pagan society would the name of that Redeemer they professed to love, and the beautiful doctrines He had preached, be evil spoken of, if the teaching were for one moment suspected of inculcating discontent or suggesting rebellion. An act, or course of acting, on the part of professed servants of God which gives occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, is ever reckoned in Holy Scripture as a sin of the deepest dye. Compare Nathan's words to King David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-14.htm" title="However,, because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born to you shall surely die.">2Samuel 12:14</a>) and St. Paul's reproach to the Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-24.htm" title="For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.">Romans 2:24</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="accented">Are servants</span> for <span class="accented">servants as are</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the doctrine</span> for <span class="accented">his doctrine</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Servants</span>; literally, <span class="accented">slaves</span>. That slaves formed a considerable portion of the first Christian Churches may be inferred from the frequency with which their duties are pressed upon them (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-21.htm">1 Corinthians 7:21-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>). It must have been an unspeakable comfort to the poor slave, whose worldly condition was hopeless and often miserable, to secure his place as one of Christ's freemen, with the sure hope of attaining "the glorious liberty of the children of God." <span class="cmt_word">Under the yoke</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the yoke of bondage" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>). Perhaps the phrase contains a touch of compassion for their state (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-10.htm">Acts 15:10</a>).

If Christian slaves withheld the honor and respect due to their masters, it would be as sure to bring reproach upon the Christian doctrine as if it taught insubordination and rebellion. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-5 Christians were not to suppose that religious knowledge, or Christian privileges, gave them any right to despise heathen masters, or to disobey lawful commands, or to expose their faults to others. And such as enjoyed the privilege of living with believing masters, were not to withhold due respect and reverence, because they were equal in respect to religious privileges, but were to serve with double diligence and cheerfulness, because of their faith in Christ, and as partakers of his free salvation. We are not to consent to any words as wholesome, except the words of our Lord Jesus Christ; to these we must give unfeigned consent. Commonly those are most proud who know least; for they do not know themselves. Hence come envy, strife, railings, evil-surmisings, disputes that are all subtlety, and of no solidity, between men of corrupt and carnal minds, ignorant of the truth and its sanctifying power, and seeking their worldly advantage.</body></html>
