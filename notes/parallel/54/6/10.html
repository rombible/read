This change, however, grammatically is unnecessary, as the article disappears before the predicate, in accordance with the well-known rule respecting subject and predicate.<p>St. Paul had just written (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-9.htm" title="But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.">1Timothy 6:9</a>) of men being plunged into destruction and perdition--the awful consequence of yielding to those lusts into which the fatal love of riches had guided them; he now sums up the teaching contained in these words by pithily remarking. "Yes, for the love of money is the root of all evil," meaning thereby, not that every evil <span class= "ital">necessarily must</span> come from "love of money," but that there is no conceivable evil which can happen to the sons and daughters of men which <span class= "ital">may</span> not spring from covetousness--a love of gold and wealth.<p><span class= "bld">Which while some coveted after.</span>--There is a slight irregularity in the image here, but the sense of the expression is perfectly clear. It is, of course, <span class= "ital">not</span> the "love of money," strictly speaking, which "some have coveted after," but the money itself. The thought in the writer's mind probably was--The man coveting gold longs for opportunities in which his covetousness (love of money) may find a field for exercise. Such inaccuracies in language are not uncommon in St. Paul's writings, as, for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-24.htm" title="For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for?">Romans 8:24</a>, where he writes of "hope that is seen."<p><span class= "bld">They have erred from the faith.</span>--Better rendered, <span class= "ital">they have wandered away from the faith.</span> This vivid picture of some who had, for sake of a little gold, given up their first love--their faith--was evidently drawn by St. Paul from life. There were <span class= "ital">some</span> in that well-known congregation at Ephesus, once faithful, now wanderers from the flock, over whom St. Paul mourned.<p><span class= "bld">And pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</span>--The language and the thoughts of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-4.htm" title="Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.">Psalm 16:4</a> were in St. Paul's mind when he wrote these words--"Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another (god)." The "many sorrows" here are, no doubt, the "gnawings of conscience," which must ever and anon harass and perplex the man or woman who, for covetousness' sake, has deserted the old paths, and has wandered away from the old loved communion of Christ.<p>The imagery used in this tenth verse seems to be that of a man who wanders from the straight, direct path of life, to gather some poisonous, fair-seeming root growing at a distance from the right road on which he was travelling. He wanders away and plucks it; and now that he has it in his hands he finds himself pierced and wounded with its unsuspected thorns.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - A <span class="accented">root</span> for <span class="accented">the root</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">all kinds of</span> for <span class="accented">all</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">some reaching after</span> for <span class="accented">while some coveted after</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">have been led astray</span> for <span class="accented">they have erred</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">have pierced</span> for <span class="accented">pierced</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Love of money</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>); only here in the New Testament, but found in the LXX. and in classical Greek. The substantive <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-14.htm">Luke 16:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-2.htm">2 Timothy 3:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">A root</span>. <span class="accented">The root</span> is better English.

Alford also quotes a striking passage from Diog. Laert., in which he mentions a saying of the philosopher Diogenes that "the love of money (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is the metropolis, or home, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>." <span class="cmt_word">Reaching after</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). It has been justly remarked that the phrase is slightly inaccurate. What some reach after is not "the love of money," but the money itself. To avoid this, Hofmann (quoted by Luther) makes <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;</span> the antecedent to <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c2;</span>, and the metaphor to be of a person turning out of his path to grasp a plant which turns out to he not desirable, but a root of bitterness. This is ingenious, but hardly to be accepted as the true interpretation. <span class="cmt_word">Pierced themselves through</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); only here in the New Testament, and rare in classical Greek. But the simple verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span>, to "pierce through," "transfix," applied 'especially to "spitting" meat, is very common in Homer, who also applies it metaphorically exactly as St. Paul does here, to grief or pain. <span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "pierced with pain" ('Il.,' 5:399). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:6-10 Those that make a trade of Christianity to serve their turn for this world, will be disappointed; but those who mind it as their calling, will find it has the promise of the life that now is, as well as of that which is to come. He that is godly, is sure to be happy in another world; and if contented with his condition in this world, he has enough; and all truly godly people are content. When brought into the greatest straits, we cannot be poorer than when we came into this world; a shroud, a coffin, and a grave, are all that the richest man in the world can have from all his wealth. If nature should be content with a little, grace should be content with less. The necessaries of life bound a true Christian's desires, and with these he will endeavour to be content. We see here the evil of covetousness. It is not said, they that are rich, but they will be rich; who place their happiness in wealth, and are eager and determined in the pursuit. Those that are such, give to Satan the opportunity of tempting them, leading them to use dishonest means, and other bad practices, to add to their gains. Also, leading into so many employments, and such a hurry of business, as leave no time or inclination for spiritual religion; leading to connexions that draw into sin and folly. What sins will not men be drawn into by the love of money! People may have money, and yet not love it; but if they love it, this will push them on to all evil. Every sort of wickedness and vice, in one way or another, grows from the love of money. We cannot look around without perceiving many proofs of this, especially in a day of outward prosperity, great expenses, and loose profession.</body></html>
