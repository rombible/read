The monstrous thought that these wordly men dare to trade upon his dear Master's religion, dare to make out of his holy doctrine a gain--the hateful word suggests to him another danger, to which many in a congregation drawn from the population of a wealthy commercial city like Ephesus were hourly exposed. This is an admirable instance of the sudden change we often notice in the subject matter in the midst of St. Paul's Epistles, of what has been aptly termed "going off at a word." The reasoning in the writer's mind was, probably--"these false men suppose godliness will be turned into gain." Yes, though <span class= "ital">they</span> were terribly mistaken, still there <span class= "ital">is</span> a sense in which their miserable notion is true. True godliness is ever accompanied with perfect contentment. In this sense, godliness <span class= "ital">does</span> bring along with it great gain to its possessor. "The heart," says Wiesinger, "amid every outward want, is then only truly rich when it not only wants nothing which it has not, but has that which raises it above what it has not."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Godliness</span>, etc. The apostle lakes up the sentiment which he had just condemned, and shows that in another sense it is most true. The godly man is rich indeed. For he wants nothing in this world but what God has given him, and has acquired riches which, unlike the riches of this world, he can take away with him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-33.htm">Luke 12:33</a>). The enumeration of his acquired treasures follows, after a parenthetical depreciation of those of the covetous man, in ver. 11. The thought, as so often in St. Paul, is a little intricate, and its flow checked by parenthetical side-thoughts. But it seems to be as follows: "<span class="accented">But</span> godliness is, in one sense, a source of great gain, and moreover brings contentment with it - contentment, I <span class="accented">say</span>, for since we brought nothing into the world, and can carry nothing out, we have good reason to be content with the necessaries of life, food and raiment. Indeed, those who strive for more, and pant after wealth, bring nothing but trouble upon themselves. For the love of money is the root of all evil, etc. Thou, therefore, O man of God, instead of reaching after worldly riches, procure the true wealth, and become rich in righteousness, godliness, <span class="accented">faith</span>," etc. (ver. 11). The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, should be construed by making the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> couple <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, so as to express that "<span class="accented">godliness"</span> <span class="accented">is</span> both "gain" and "<span class="accented">contentment"</span> - <span class="accented"> not</span> as if <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> qualified <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> - <span class="accented">that</span> would have been expressed by the collocation, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Contentment</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>). The word occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-8.htm">2 Corinthians 9:8</a>, where it is rendered, both in the R.V. and the A.V., "sufficiency." The adjective <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11</a> (and common in classical Greek), is rendered "content." It means "sufficient in or of itself" - needing no external aid - and is applied to persons, countries, cities, moral qualities, etc. The substantive <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is the condition of the person, or thing, which is <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:6-10 Those that make a trade of Christianity to serve their turn for this world, will be disappointed; but those who mind it as their calling, will find it has the promise of the life that now is, as well as of that which is to come. He that is godly, is sure to be happy in another world; and if contented with his condition in this world, he has enough; and all truly godly people are content. When brought into the greatest straits, we cannot be poorer than when we came into this world; a shroud, a coffin, and a grave, are all that the richest man in the world can have from all his wealth. If nature should be content with a little, grace should be content with less. The necessaries of life bound a true Christian's desires, and with these he will endeavour to be content. We see here the evil of covetousness. It is not said, they that are rich, but they will be rich; who place their happiness in wealth, and are eager and determined in the pursuit. Those that are such, give to Satan the opportunity of tempting them, leading them to use dishonest means, and other bad practices, to add to their gains. Also, leading into so many employments, and such a hurry of business, as leave no time or inclination for spiritual religion; leading to connexions that draw into sin and folly. What sins will not men be drawn into by the love of money! People may have money, and yet not love it; but if they love it, this will push them on to all evil. Every sort of wickedness and vice, in one way or another, grows from the love of money. We cannot look around without perceiving many proofs of this, especially in a day of outward prosperity, great expenses, and loose profession.</body></html>
