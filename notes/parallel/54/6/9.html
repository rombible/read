Those who exposed themselves to the winning temptations and deadly sins he was about to speak of were not "the rich," but those who longingly plan to be rich.<p><span class= "bld">Fall into temptation.</span>--Those longing to be rich will fall into the temptation to increase their worldly goods, even at the sacrifice of principle. Some unlawful method of gratifying their passion for gain will present itself; conscientious scruples will be thrown to the winds, and they who wish to be rich will fall into the temptation. We pray so often <span class= "ital">His</span> prayer, "Lead us not into temptation." In the same hour we long--perhaps even with the same breath we pray--that our worldly means may be increased, our position bettered, little thinking that the longing for an increase of riches and position will lead us into the most dangerous of all temptations!<p><span class= "bld">And a snare.</span>--A very tangle, as it has been well called, of conflicting motives--each fresh gratification of the ruling passion, perhaps excused under the plausible names of industry, home claims, praiseworthy and healthy enterprise, entangling the unhappy soul more completely.<p><span class= "bld">And into many foolish and hurtful lusts.</span>--The lusts or desires into which those who long to be rich fall, are well named "foolish," because in so many instances they are passionate desires for things utterly undesirable, the possession of which can afford neither pleasure nor advantage--such, for instance, is the love of hoarding wealth, so common to those men who have longed for and obtained riches; and "hurtful" often to the body as well as to the soul do these rich find their "longings," when gratified.<p><span class= "bld">Which drown men in . . .</span>--Better rendered, <span class= "ital">which plunge men into</span> . . .<p><span class= "bld">Destruction and perdition.</span>--"Destruction" refers rather to wreck and ruin of the body, whilst "perdition" belongs rather to that more awful ruin of the eternal soul. The gratification of desires, whether these desires are centred in the lower animal passions of the table, or in the pursuit of yet baser and more selfish passions still, invariably leads to the destruction of the poor frail human body first. This premature breaking up of the earthly tabernacle is the herald and precursor of the final perdition of the immortal soul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="accented">Desire to</span> for <span class="accented">will</span>, A.V.; a <span class="accented">temptation</span> for <span class="accented">temptation</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">many</span> for <span class="accented">into many</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">such as</span> for <span class="accented">which</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">A temptation</span>.

But if so, the reasoning is not good, because "temptation" implies a state, not merely a single temptation. The prefixing of the article is therefore improper.

He that is godly, is sure to be happy in another world; and if contented with his condition in this world, he has enough; and all truly godly people are content. When brought into the greatest straits, we cannot be poorer than when we came into this world; a shroud, a coffin, and a grave, are all that the richest man in the world can have from all his wealth. If nature should be content with a little, grace should be content with less. The necessaries of life bound a true Christian's desires, and with these he will endeavour to be content. We see here the evil of covetousness. It is not said, they that are rich, but they will be rich; who place their happiness in wealth, and are eager and determined in the pursuit. Those that are such, give to Satan the opportunity of tempting them, leading them to use dishonest means, and other bad practices, to add to their gains. Also, leading into so many employments, and such a hurry of business, as leave no time or inclination for spiritual religion; leading to connexions that draw into sin and folly. What sins will not men be drawn into by the love of money! People may have money, and yet not love it; but if they love it, this will push them on to all evil. Every sort of wickedness and vice, in one way or another, grows from the love of money. We cannot look around without perceiving many proofs of this, especially in a day of outward prosperity, great expenses, and loose profession.</body></html>
