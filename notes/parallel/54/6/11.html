The writers and actors in the New Testament history we have so long surrounded with a halo of reverence, that we are tempted often to forget that they were but men exposed to temptations like us, and not unfrequently succumbing to them. We owe them, indeed, a deep debt of reverence for their faithful, gallant witness--for their splendid service in laying so well the early storeys of the great Christian Temple; but we lose somewhat of the reality of the Apostolic story when in the saint we forget the man. After the very solemn, the intensely earnest warning against covetousness--that fatal love of gain and gold which seems to have been the mainspring of the life of those false teachers who were engaged in marring the noble work St. Paul had done for his Master at Ephesus--after these weighty words, the fact of St. Paul turning to Timothy, and, with the grand old covenant title Timothy knew so well, personally addressing his loved friend with "But thou, O man of God, flee these things," leads us irresistibly to the conclusion that the old Apostle was dreading for his young and comparatively untried disciple the corrupting danger of the wealth of the city in which he held so great a charge; so he warns Timothy, and, through Timothy, God's servants of all grades and powers in different ages, of the soul-destroying dangers of covetousness--"Flee these things." A glance at Timothy's present life will show how possible it was, even for a loved pupil of St. Paul--even for one of whom he once wrote, "I have no man likeminded;" and, again, "Ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-20.htm" title="For I have no man like minded, who will naturally care for your state.">Philippians 2:20-22</a>)--to need so grave a reminder. Since those days, when these words were written to the Philippians, some six years had passed. His was no longer the old harassed life of danger and hazard to which, as the companion of the missionary St. Paul, he was constantly exposed. He now filled the position of an honoured teacher and leader in a rich and organised church; many and grievous were the temptations to which, in such a station, he would be exposed.<p>Gold and popularity, gain and ease, were to be won with the sacrifice of <span class= "ital">apparently</span> so little, but with this sacrifice Timothy would cease to be the "man of God." To maintain that St. Paul was aware of any weakness <span class= "ital">already</span> shown by his disciple and friend would, of course, be a baseless assertion; but that the older man dreaded for the younger these dangerous influences is clear. The term "man of God" was the common Old Testament name for "divine messengers," but under the new covenant the name seems extended to all just men faithful to the Lord Jesus. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-17.htm" title="That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished to all good works.">2Timothy 3:17</a>.) The solemn warning, then, through Timothy comes to each of His servants, "Flee <span class= "ital">thou</span> from covetousness."<p><span class= "bld">And follow after righteousness.</span>--"The evil must be overcome with good" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-21.htm" title="Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.">Romans 12:21</a>). The "man of God," tossing away from him all covetous longings, must press after "righteousness;" here used in a general sense, signifying "the inner life shaped after the Law of God."<p><span class= "bld">Faith, love.</span>--The two characteristic virtues of Christianity. The one may be termed the hand that lays hold of God's mercy; and the other the mainspring of the Christian's life.<p><span class= "bld">Patience.</span>--That brave patience which, for Christ's dear sake, with a smile can bear up against all sufferings.<p><span class= "bld">Meekness.</span>--The German "sanftmuth"--the meekness of heart and feeling with which a Christian acts towards his enemies. His conduct who "when he was reviled, reviled not again" best exemplifies this virtue.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O man of God.</span> The force of this address is very great. It indicates that the money-lovers just spoken of were not and could not be "men of God," whatever they might profess; and it leads with singular strength to the opposite direction in which Timothy's aspirations should point. The treasures which he must covet as "a man of God" were "righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience meekness." For the phrase, "man of God," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-17.htm">2 Timothy 3:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>. In the Old Testament it always applies to a prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-1.htm">Deuteronomy 33:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-6.htm">Judges 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-27.htm">1 Samuel 2:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-22.htm">1 Kings 12:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-9.htm">2 Kings 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-4.htm">Jeremiah 35:4</a>; and a great many other passages). St. Paul uses the expression with especial reference to Timothy and his holy office, and here, perhaps, in contrast with the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> mentioned in ver. 9. <span class="cmt_word">Flee these things.</span> Note the sharp contrast between "the men" of the world, who reach after, and the man of God, who avoids, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. The expression, "these things," is a little loose, but seems to apply to the love of money, and the desire to be rich, with all their attendant "foolish and hurtful lusts." The man of God avoids the perdition and maul fold sorrows of the covetous, by avoiding the covetousness which is their root. <span class="cmt_word">Follow after</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>); pursue, in direct contrast with <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;</span>, flee from, avoid (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-22.htm">2 Timothy 2:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Meekness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x27;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). This rare word, found in Philo, but nowhere in the New Testament, is the reading of the R.T. (instead of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;&#x3bf;&#x37e;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> of the T.R.) and accepted by almost all critics on the authority of all the older manuscripts. It has no perceptible difference of meaning from <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, meekness or gentleness. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:11-16 It ill becomes any men, but especially men of God, to set their hearts upon the things of this world; men of God should be taken up with the things of God. There must be a conflict with corruption, and temptations, and the powers of darkness. Eternal life is the crown proposed for our encouragement. We are called to lay hold thereon. To the rich must especially be pointed out their dangers and duties, as to the proper use of wealth. But who can give such a charge, that is not himself above the love of things that wealth can buy? The appearing of Christ is certain, but it is not for us to know the time. Mortal eyes cannot bear the brightness of the Divine glory. None can approach him except as he is made known unto sinners in and by Christ. The Godhead is here adored without distinction of Persons, as all these things are properly spoken, whether of the Father, the Son, or the Holy Ghost. God is revealed to us, only in and through the human nature of Christ, as the only begotten Son of the Father.</body></html>
