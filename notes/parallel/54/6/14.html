It was that he should keep the commandment without spot, unrebukeable. The commandment was the teaching of Jesus Christ, the gospel message, <span class= "ital">that</span> was to be proclaimed in all its fulness; and that this might be done effectually it was needful that the life of its preacher should be without flaw--blameless; in other words, it was absolutely requisite that the chief pastor in Ephesus should <span class= "ital">live</span> the life he preached. There were those (the false teachers of whom he had been speaking, well known to Timothy) whose lives had dishonoured the glorious commandment they professed to love and teach.<p><span class= "bld">Until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>--The speedy return of the Lord in glory was, no doubt, looked for in the Church of the first days. The expressions of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1Thessalonians 4:15-18</a> evidently were written at a time when the second advent of Messiah was looked on as probably near at hand. By slow degrees--as one great teacher of the first days after the other fell asleep in Jesus, and the first generation of believers was rapidly passing away, and no fresh sign of the coming in glory was manifested--the strong expressions used in the first fervour which succeeded the Pentecost morning began to be qualified, as in this Epistle, written far on in St. Paul's life, by words which seemed to say to Timothy: "Keep the Master's commandment pure and blameless till the hour of that glorious Epiphany which your eyes will possibly behold."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> for <span class="accented">this</span>, A.V. <span class="accented">without reproach</span> for <span class="accented">unrebukable</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The commandment</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>). The phrase is peculiar, and must have some special meaning. Perhaps, as Bishop Wordsworth expounds it, "the commandment" is that law of faith and duty to which Timothy vowed obedience at his baptism, and is parallel to "the good confession." Some think that the command given in vers. 11, 12 is referred to; and this is the meaning of the A.V. "this." <span class="cmt_word">Without spot, without reproach</span>. There is a difference of opinion among commentators, whether these two adjectives (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) belong to the commandment or to the person, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Timothy.

There must be a conflict with corruption, and temptations, and the powers of darkness. Eternal life is the crown proposed for our encouragement. We are called to lay hold thereon. To the rich must especially be pointed out their dangers and duties, as to the proper use of wealth. But who can give such a charge, that is not himself above the love of things that wealth can buy? The appearing of Christ is certain, but it is not for us to know the time. Mortal eyes cannot bear the brightness of the Divine glory. None can approach him except as he is made known unto sinners in and by Christ. The Godhead is here adored without distinction of Persons, as all these things are properly spoken, whether of the Father, the Son, or the Holy Ghost. God is revealed to us, only in and through the human nature of Christ, as the only begotten Son of the Father.</body></html>
