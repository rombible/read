Schismatic and heretical preachers and writers in all ages have sadly hindered the progress of true religion; but in the days of St. Paul, when the foundation-stones of the faith were being so painfully laid, there seems to have been a life-and-death contest between the teachers of the true and the false. In this passage St. Paul lays bare the secret springs of much of this anti-Christian doctrine. There is little doubt but that at Ephesus there existed then a school, professedly Christian, which taught the slave who had accepted the yoke of Christ to rebel against the yoke of any earthly lord. Hence the indignation of St. Paul. "If any man teach otherwise," different to <span class= "ital">my</span> interpretation of the rule of Christ, which bids us bear all with brave patience, with loyal fortitude.<p><span class= "bld">And consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>--The Apostle, no doubt, was referring to well-known sayings of the Redeemer, such as "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's," or "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth," or "If any man will follow me, let him take up his cross daily, and follow me;" "But I say unto you, resist not evil," "Love your enemies, pray for them which despitefully use you." It was upon such sublime sayings as these--no doubt, current watchwords in all the churches--it was upon <span class= "ital">the spirit</span> of the Sermon on the Mount that St. Paul based his teaching and grounded his advice to the slaves in the flock of Christ.

And such as enjoyed the privilege of living with believing masters, were not to withhold due respect and reverence, because they were equal in respect to religious privileges, but were to serve with double diligence and cheerfulness, because of their faith in Christ, and as partakers of his free salvation. We are not to consent to any words as wholesome, except the words of our Lord Jesus Christ; to these we must give unfeigned consent. Commonly those are most proud who know least; for they do not know themselves. Hence come envy, strife, railings, evil-surmisings, disputes that are all subtlety, and of no solidity, between men of corrupt and carnal minds, ignorant of the truth and its sanctifying power, and seeking their worldly advantage.</body></html>
