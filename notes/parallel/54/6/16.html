"But one alone, 'God,' can be said <span class= "ital">to have immortality," </span>because He, unlike other immortal beings who enjoy their immortality through the will of another, derives it from His own essence.<p><span class= "bld">Dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto.</span>--This should be rendered, <span class= "ital">dwelling in light unapproachable.</span> The Eternal is here pictured as dwelling in an atmosphere of light too glorious for any created beings (not only men) to approach. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-2.htm" title="Who cover yourself with light as with a garment: who stretch out the heavens like a curtain:">Psalm 104:2</a>, where the Eternal is addressed as covering himself with <span class= "ital">light</span> as with a garment; see too <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-22.htm" title="He reveals the deep and secret things: he knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him.">Daniel 2:22</a>, where light is spoken of as dwelling with God.) The symbolism of the old covenant teaches the same truth, the unapproachable glories in which God dwells; for instance, the guarding of the bounds of Sinai in the giving of the Law; the covering of the faces of the Seraphim in the year that King Uzziah died, when Isaiah saw the divine vision; the veiled darkness of the Holy of holies in the Tabernacle and the Temple, where ever and anon the visible glory dwelt.<p><span class= "bld">Whom no man hath seen, nor can see.</span>--The Old Testament teaches the same mysterious truth--"For there shall no man see me, and live" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-20.htm" title="And he said, You can not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.">Exodus 33:20</a>, and also <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-12.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only you heard a voice.">Deuteronomy 4:12</a>). <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a> repeats this in very plain words--"No man hath seen God at any time." The Greek word here includes all created beings. The English translation, "no man," utterly fails to reproduce the meaning of the original. (See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-12.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwells in us, and his love is perfected in us.">1John 4:12</a>.)<p>These last words seem to preclude the interpretation which applies the foregoing description to the Son. We have above referred this glorious doxology to the Father, as the one who, in His own times, should reveal the Lord Jesus returning to judgment.<p>It is, however, very noteworthy that the loftiest, the sublimest, epithets the inspired pen of Paul could frame to dignify his description of the First Person of the ever-blessed Trinity, God the Father, are used again of the Son. "The Lamb shall overcome them: for he is <span class= "ital">Lord of lords, and King of kings"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-14.htm" title="These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.">Revelation 17:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-16.htm" title="And he has on his clothing and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.">Revelation 19:16</a>; and see too <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-5.htm" title="And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth.

The appearance of the "God of Israel" to Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-9.htm">Exodus 34:9-11</a>, was that of the Son in anticipation of the Incarnation. The invisibility of the essential Godhead is also predicated in our Lord's saying, "God is a Spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>). This whole passage is a magnificent embodiment of the attributes of the living God, supreme blessedness and almighty power, universal dominion, and unchangeable being, inscrutable majesty, radiant holiness, and glory inaccessible and unapproachable by his creatures, save through the mediation of his only begotten Son. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:11-16 It ill becomes any men, but especially men of God, to set their hearts upon the things of this world; men of God should be taken up with the things of God. There must be a conflict with corruption, and temptations, and the powers of darkness. Eternal life is the crown proposed for our encouragement. We are called to lay hold thereon. To the rich must especially be pointed out their dangers and duties, as to the proper use of wealth. But who can give such a charge, that is not himself above the love of things that wealth can buy? The appearing of Christ is certain, but it is not for us to know the time. Mortal eyes cannot bear the brightness of the Divine glory. None can approach him except as he is made known unto sinners in and by Christ. The Godhead is here adored without distinction of Persons, as all these things are properly spoken, whether of the Father, the Son, or the Holy Ghost. God is revealed to us, only in and through the human nature of Christ, as the only begotten Son of the Father.</body></html>
