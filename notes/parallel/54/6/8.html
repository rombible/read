There the Apostle is warning the Church against a false, unreal asceticism, which was teaching men to look upon the rich gifts of this world, its beauties and its delights, as of themselves sinful, forgetting that these fair things were God's creatures, and were given for man's use and enjoyment. Here the same great teacher is pressing home the truth that the highest good on earth was that godliness which is ever accompanied with perfect contentment, which neither rejects nor deems evil the fair things of this life, but which, at the same time, never covets them, never longs for them. It was one thing to be rich, it was another to wish to be rich; in God's providence a man might be rich without sin, but the coveting, the longing for wealth, at once exposed him to many a grave danger both to body and soul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="accented">But</span> for <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">covering for raiment</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">ice shall be</span> for <span class="accented">let us be</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Food</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>); here only in the New Testament, but common in the LXX., rare in classical Greek. <span class="cmt_word">Covering</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>); also <span class="accented">a</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in the New Testament, not found in the LXX., and rare in classical Greek. The kindred words, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, with their derivatives, are used of the covering or shelter of clothes, or tents, or houses. St. Paul may therefore have used an uncommon word in order to comprise the <span class="accented">two</span> necessaries of raiment and house, though Huther thinks this "more than improbable." The use of the word "covering" in the R.V. seems designed to favor this double application. Ellicott thinks the word "probably only refers to clothing." Alford says, "Some take ' covering' of both clothing and dwelling, perhaps rightly." If one knew where St. Paul got the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> from, one could form a more decided opinion as to his meaning. <span class="cmt_word">We shall be therewith content</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>). The proper meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> followed by a dative is "<span class="accented">to</span> be content with" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-14.htm">Luke 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>). There is probably a covert hortative force in the use of the future here. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:6-10 Those that make a trade of Christianity to serve their turn for this world, will be disappointed; but those who mind it as their calling, will find it has the promise of the life that now is, as well as of that which is to come. He that is godly, is sure to be happy in another world; and if contented with his condition in this world, he has enough; and all truly godly people are content. When brought into the greatest straits, we cannot be poorer than when we came into this world; a shroud, a coffin, and a grave, are all that the richest man in the world can have from all his wealth. If nature should be content with a little, grace should be content with less. The necessaries of life bound a true Christian's desires, and with these he will endeavour to be content. We see here the evil of covetousness. It is not said, they that are rich, but they will be rich; who place their happiness in wealth, and are eager and determined in the pursuit. Those that are such, give to Satan the opportunity of tempting them, leading them to use dishonest means, and other bad practices, to add to their gains. Also, leading into so many employments, and such a hurry of business, as leave no time or inclination for spiritual religion; leading to connexions that draw into sin and folly. What sins will not men be drawn into by the love of money! People may have money, and yet not love it; but if they love it, this will push them on to all evil. Every sort of wickedness and vice, in one way or another, grows from the love of money. We cannot look around without perceiving many proofs of this, especially in a day of outward prosperity, great expenses, and loose profession.</body></html>
