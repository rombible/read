Josephus especially mentions how a refusal on the part of the Jews to pray for Roman magistrates led to the great war with the empire which ended in their destruction as a separate nation.<p>A well-known passage in the <span class= "ital">Apology</span> of Tertullian, written about a century and a quarter after St. Paul sent his first letter to Timothy, shows how well and carefully this charge of the great teacher, written to the Church in Ephesus, was kept in distant Carthage:--"We Christians. . . . do intercede for all the emperors that their lives may be prolonged, their government be secured to them, that their families may be preserved in safety, their senates faithful to them, their armies brave, their people honest, and that the whole empire may be at peace, and for whatever other things are desired by the people or the Caesar."<p>Early in the second century, Polycarp of Smyrna bears similar testimony to this practice in the early Church of praying publicly for their heathen rulers:--"Pray for all the saints; pray, too, for all kings and powers and rulers, and for your persecutors, and those that hate you, and for your cruel enemies."<p><span class= "bld">That we may lead a quiet and peaceable life.</span>--What now is the special object of this prayer for those in high authority and power? First, that through <span class= "ital">their</span> wise rule the Christians might enjoy peace; and, second, that the temper of the people who prayed thus for the ruling powers might be so affected the constant repetition of such prayers: that all thoughts of revolt and resistance would be gradually stamped out.<p>St. Paul knew whom he was addressing. The Christian congregations of his age were largely made up of Jews. An intense longing to throw off the yoke of Rome pervaded the whole nation. The terrible events of the year 70 (only four or five years at most from the time of writing this Epistle) show how deep-seated was their hatred of the stranger. No Christian, however, was implicated in that fatal rebellion; so thoroughly had the teaching of St. Paul and his fellow Apostles done its work among the Jewish followers of the Crucified.<p><span class= "bld">In all godliness and honesty.</span>--The word rendered "honesty" is better translated <span class= "ital">gravity, </span>or decorum. These words are only used by St. Paul in his Pastoral Epistles, where "godliness" occurs nine times, and "gravity" three times. The sphere, so to speak, in which St. Paul's ideal Christian must walk during his quiet, unobtrusive pilgrimage, was reverence and decorum.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="accented">And all</span> for <span class="accented">and for all</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">high place</span> for <span class="accented">authority</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">tranquil and quiet</span> for <span class="accented">quiet and peaceable</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">gravity</span> for <span class="accented">honesty</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">For kings</span>, etc. The early Liturgies closely followed these directions. "Every day, both in the evening and the morning, we offer prayers for the whole world, for kings, and for all in authority" (Chrysost., <span class="accented">in lee</span>.). So in the Liturgy of St. Mark: "Preserve our king in peace, in virtue, and righteousness.... Subdue his enemies under him... incline him to peace towards us and towards thy Holy Name, that in the serenity of his reign we too may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all piety and honesty [or, 'gravity']." In the Liturgy of St. Clement: "Let us pray for kings and those in authority, that they may be peaceably inclined toward us, and that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all piety and honesty [or, 'gravity']." In the Liturgy of St. Chrysostom: "Let us pray for our most religious and God-protected emperors, and all their palace and court." "We offer this our reasonable service on behalf of our most faithful and Christian (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) emperors, and all their palace and court." And in the Liturgy of St. Basil: "Remember, Lord, our most religious and faithful kings... that in their serenity we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity. Remember, O Lord, all rulers and all in authority, and all our brethren in the palace, and the whole court." <span class="cmt_word">In high place</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1fc7;</span>); elsewhere only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-1.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1</a>, where it is rendered "<span class="accented">excellency</span>." But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a> we have <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> "the higher powers;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, "the king as supreme."

That we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity. The prayer for the rulers is recommended (as was explained in the above extracts from the Liturgies) in order to obtain for Christians a tranquil life, undisturbed by persecution and molestation, in spite of their peculiar way of life. Their wish was to be allowed to live in the faith and obedience of the gospel, "in godliness and gravity," without being interfered with by the heathen magistrates. The clause in the Prayer for the Church Militant which corresponds to this is "that under her we may be godly and quietly governed." <span class="accented">Tranquil</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); found only here in the New Testament. The derivatives, <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, etc., are common in the LXX. They all apply to a <span class="accented">still</span>, <span class="accented">undisturbed</span>, life. <span class="accented">Quiet</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); found only here and l Peter 3:4 in the New Testament, and in the LXX. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-2.htm">Isaiah 66:2</a>. But the noun <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> are common. <span class="accented">Godliness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>). One of the words almost peculiar to the pastoral Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-7.htm">1 Timothy 4:7, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3, 5, 6, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-5.htm">2 Timothy 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-1.htm">Titus 1:1</a>); but elsewhere only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-12.htm">Acts 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-3.htm">2 Peter 1:3, 6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-11.htm">2 Peter 3:11</a>. Cornelius was <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, and so was one of the soldiers who waited upon him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-2.htm">Acts 10:2, 7</a>). Ananias was <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-12.htm">Acts 22:12</a>, T.R.). The adverb <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> is also peculiar to the pastoral Epistles (2 Timothy fit. 12; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-12.htm">Titus 2:12</a>). <span class="accented">Gravity</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>): so rendered also in the A.V. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-7.htm">Titus 2:7</a> - the only other places in the New Testament where it is found. So also the adjective <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-8.htm">1 Timothy 3:8, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-2.htm">Titus 2:2</a>). Elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>, where it is rendered" honest" in the A.V., and "honorable" in the R.V. In classical Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is properly spoken of the gods, "august," "venerable," and, when applied to persons, indicates a similar quality. Here <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> is the respectable, venerable, and dignified sobriety of a truly godly man. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 The disciples of Christ must be praying people; all, without distinction of nation, sect, rank, or party. Our duty as Christians, is summed up in two words; godliness, that is, the right worshipping of God; and honesty, that is, good conduct toward all men. These must go together: we are not truly honest, if we are not godly, and do not render to God his due; and we are not truly godly, if not honest. What is acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, we should abound in. There is one Mediator, and that Mediator gave himself a ransom for all. And this appointment has been made for the benefit of the Jews and the Gentiles of every nation; that all who are willing may come in this way, to the mercy-seat of a pardoning God, to seek reconciliation with him. Sin had made a quarrel between us and God; Jesus Christ is the Mediator who makes peace. He is a ransom that was to be known in due time. In the Old Testament times, his sufferings, and the glory that should follow, were spoken of as things to be revealed in the last times. Those who are saved must come to the knowledge of the truth, for that is God's appointed way to save sinners: if we do not know the truth, we cannot be ruled by it.</body></html>
