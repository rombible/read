To announce which witness--the witness being the suffering and the death of Christ--St. Paul was ordained an Apostle--the reference being entirely to what preceded.<p><span class= "bld">I speak the truth . . .</span> <span class= "bld">and lie not.</span>--The warmth with which St. Paul here asserted his divinely conferred commission as preacher and Apostle, was not called out by any desire on his part to seize an occasion of asserting in the presence of his enemies, the false heretical teachers of Ephesus, his especial rank and prerogatives as an Apostle chosen and commissioned by the Most High. These fiery and earnest words had no private reference to <span class= "ital">him, </span>St. Paul, or to <span class= "ital">his</span> especial claims to be heard, but were uttered solely in view of the surpassing magnitude of the message with which he was charged--solely to bear a weighty and imposing testimony to the truth of his assertion, which so many were ready and eager to dispute--the assertion that the gospel of Jesus Christ was a message of glad tidings, was an offer of salvation, not to a <span class= "ital">people, </span>but to a <span class= "ital">world.</span><p><span class= "bld">A teacher of the Gentiles.</span>--This specifies more clearly the especial duties of his apostleship, not perhaps without some reference to the peculiar fitness which marked him out as the declarer of the divine will in respect to this gracious offer of redemption to the isles of the scattered countless Gentiles.<p><span class= "bld">In faith and verity.</span>--Better rendered, <span class= "ital">in faith and truth.</span> These words specify the sphere in which the Apostle performed his great mission. The first, "in faith," refers to St. Paul's own personal faith in Jesus--the grand motive power of his life and work; the second, "in truth," refers to the truth of Christianity--to the well-known facts of the gospel story. Or, in other words, St. Paul carried on his ceaseless labours, <span class= "ital">within</span> gathering fresh and ever fresh strength from the exhaustless spring of his own loving, mighty faith in Jesus, and <span class= "ital">without</span> appealing to the generally well-known incidents of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, the truth of which all might test. In those days there were even many <span class= "ital">eye-witnesses</span> of the Passion still living.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="accented">Was appointed</span> for <span class="accented">am ordained</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">truth</span> for <span class="accented">truth in Christ</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">I lie</span> for <span class="accented">and lie</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">truth</span> for <span class="accented">verity</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">I was appointed,</span> etc. It is quite in St. Paul's manner thus to refer to his own apostolic mission (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-1.htm">1 Corinthians 1:1, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-2.htm">Ephesians 3:2, 8</a>; and many other places). <span class="cmt_word">A preacher</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;</span>; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-11.htm">2 Timothy 1:11</a>).

It combines the idea of authority in the preacher who is the authorized herald (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-15.htm">Romans 10:15</a>), and publicity for his message (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-27.htm">Matthew 10:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-3.htm">Luke 12:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I speak the truth</span>, etc. The reason for this strong asseveration of his office as the apostle of the Gentiles is not at first sight apparent. But it was probably made in view of the antagonism of the Judaizing teachers referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3, 19, 20</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15, 16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 The disciples of Christ must be praying people; all, without distinction of nation, sect, rank, or party. Our duty as Christians, is summed up in two words; godliness, that is, the right worshipping of God; and honesty, that is, good conduct toward all men. These must go together: we are not truly honest, if we are not godly, and do not render to God his due; and we are not truly godly, if not honest. What is acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, we should abound in. There is one Mediator, and that Mediator gave himself a ransom for all. And this appointment has been made for the benefit of the Jews and the Gentiles of every nation; that all who are willing may come in this way, to the mercy-seat of a pardoning God, to seek reconciliation with him. Sin had made a quarrel between us and God; Jesus Christ is the Mediator who makes peace. He is a ransom that was to be known in due time. In the Old Testament times, his sufferings, and the glory that should follow, were spoken of as things to be revealed in the last times. Those who are saved must come to the knowledge of the truth, for that is God's appointed way to save sinners: if we do not know the truth, we cannot be ruled by it.</body></html>
