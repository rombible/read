"Adam was not deceived;" the Apostle now refers to the general basis of his direction respecting the exclusion of women from all public praying and teaching contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/2-9.htm" title="In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with modesty and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;">1Timothy 2:9-12</a>. The argument here is a singular one--Adam and Eve both sinned, but Adam was not deceived. He sinned, quite aware all the while of the magnitude of the sin he was voluntarily committing. Eve, on the other hand, was completely, thoroughly deceived (the preposition with which the Greek verb is compounded here conveying the idea of thoroughness)--she succumbed to the serpent's deceit. Both were involved in the sin, but only one (Eve) allowed herself to be deluded. So Bengel, "<span class= "ital">Deceptio indicat minus robur in intellectu, atque hic nervus est cur mulieri non liceat docere."</span> Prof. Reynolds thus comments on the argument of the Apostle:--"This may sound to our ears a far-fetched argument, when used to discountenance female usurpation of intellectual supremacy. It was, however, a method current at the time to look for and find in the Scriptures the concrete expressions of almost all philosophical judgments. At the present day we could hardly find a more vivid illustration of the essential difference between the masculine and feminine nature. If there be this distinction between the sexes, that distinction still furnishes the basis of an argument and a reason for the advice here rendered. The catastrophe of Eden is the beacon for all generations when the sexes repeat the folly of Eve and Adam, and exchange their distinctive position and functions."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="accented">Beguiled</span> (twice) for <span class="accented">deceived</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">hath fallen into</span> for <span class="accented">was in the</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Beguiled</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>).

Bishop Ellicott gives the passages in which <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> followed, as here, by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-44.htm">Luke 22:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-17.htm">Acts 22:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:5</a>), "denoting entrance into, and continuance in, any given state." <span class="accented">As</span> regards the apostle's statement, <span class="cmt_word">Adam was not beguiled</span>, we must understand it as based merely upon the text in Genesis to which he refers, in which Eve (not Adam) says, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>, "The serpent beguiled me." Just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a> he reasons from <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> being in the singular number, and as the writer to the <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-3.htm">Hebrews 7:3</a> reasons from the <span class="accented">silence</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a>. regarding the parentage of Melchizedek. Huther (<span class="accented">in lee</span>.) says that this mode of reasoning is peculiar to allegorical interpretation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-15 Under the gospel, prayer is not to be confined to any one particular house of prayer, but men must pray every where. We must pray in our closets, pray in our families, pray at our meals, pray when we are on journeys, and pray in the solemn assemblies, whether more public or private. We must pray in charity; without wrath, or malice, or anger at any person. We must pray in faith, without doubting, and without disputing. Women who profess the Christian religion, must be modest in apparel, not affecting gaudiness, gaiety, or costliness. Good works are the best ornament; these are, in the sight of God, of great price. Modesty and neatness are more to be consulted in garments than elegance and fashion. And it would be well if the professors of serious godliness were wholly free from vanity in dress. They should spend more time and money in relieving the sick and distressed, than in decorating themselves and their children. To do this in a manner unsuitable to their rank in life, and their profession of godliness, is sinful. These are not trifles, but Divine commands. The best ornaments for professors of godliness, are good works. According to St. Paul, women are not allowed to be public teachers in the church; for teaching is an office of authority. But good women may and ought to teach their children at home the principles of true religion. Also, women must not think themselves excused from learning what is necessary to salvation, though they must not usurp authority. As woman was last in the creation, which is one reason for her subjection, so she was first in the transgression. But there is a word of comfort; that those who continue in sobriety, shall be saved in child-bearing, or with child-bearing, by the Messiah, who was born of a woman. And the especial sorrow to which the female sex is subject, should cause men to exercise their authority with much gentleness, tenderness, and affection.</body></html>
