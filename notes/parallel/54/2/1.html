The detailed injunctions <span class= "ital">how</span> the charge was to be carried out are introduced by the Greek particle <span class= "ital">oun, </span>translated in our version by "therefore;" it may be paraphrased thus: "In pursuance of my great charge, I proceed by special details; in the first place, let prayers <span class= "ital">for all</span> be offered by the congregation."<p><span class= "bld">Supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks.</span>--Many attempts, some of them not very happy ones, have been made by grammarians and commentators to distinguish between these terms, each of which denotes prayer. On the whole, it may be assumed that the Greek word translated "supplications" signifies a request for particular benefits, and is a special form of the more general word rendered "prayers." The third expression in the English version translated "intercessions" suggests a closer and more intimate communion with God on the part of the one praying. It speaks of drawing near God, of entering into free, familiar speech with Him. The Greek word suggests prayer in its most individual, urgent form. The fourth term, "giving of thanks," expresses that which ought never to be absent from any of our devotions, gratitude for past mercies. Archbishop Trench remarks how this peculiar form of prayer will subsist in heaven when, in the very nature of things, all other forms of prayer will have ceased in the entire fruition of the things prayed for, for then only will the redeemed know how much they owe to their Lord. The word <span class= "ital">eucharist</span> is derived from the Greek word used in this place--<span class= "ital">eucharistia</span>--for in the Holy Communion the Church embodies its highest act of thanksgiving for the highest benefits received.<p><span class= "bld">For all men.</span>--Professor Reynolds well comments on the hardness of the task set us here--"It is difficult for us always to love all men, to think of all men as equally dear to God, or to regard all men as equally capable of being blessed. Timothy, after reading this letter, probably walked along the marble colonnade of the great temple of Artemis, or heard the hum of some twenty thousand Asiatic Greeks crowded in the vast theatre to witness the gladiatorial fight, or encountered a procession of Bacchantes, or turned into the synagogue on the side of the Coresias and saw the averted looks, and felt the bitter hatred of some old friends. We, with some knowledge of the modern world, have to look into the 'hells' upon earth; to survey the gold-fields and battle-fields; the African slave-hunts; the throngs and saloons of Pekin, Calcutta, and Paris; the monasteries of Tibet; and make prayers, petitions, intercessions, and thanksgivings, too, on behalf of all men. In the beginning of the Gospel, Timothy received this quiet injunction from the Apostle Paul. Now the once whispered word peals like the voice of many waters and mighty thunderings over the whole Church of God."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="accented">First of all</span>, <span class="accented">that</span> for <span class="accented">that</span>, <span class="accented">first of all</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">thanksgivings</span> for <span class="accented">and giving of thanks</span>. A.V. <span class="cmt_word">I exhort therefore.</span> The insertion of the connecting particle "therefore" marks that this arrangement of Church prayers is a part - as the following words, first of all, mark that it is the first part - of that charge or administration which was now committed to Timothy. <span class="cmt_word">Supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings</span> (see the Prayer for the Church Militant). The question naturally arises whether the first words here used - <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> - have any distinctive meaning, or are merely accumulated, like synonyms m legal documents, or various phrases in rhetorical addresses, to ensure completeness and to add force. It is against the notion of any distinctive meaning attaching to them that no such distinction can be supported by actual use. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a> two of the words (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) are used in conjunction as here with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, with no apparent difference, both being the way of making known their requests to God (so also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-18.htm">Ephesians 6:18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-5.htm">1 Timothy 5:5</a>). Again, in the ancient Liturgies, the words <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> are constantly used of the same praying. It may, however, perhaps be said that every <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>, though every <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> is not a <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is a "petition" - a distinct asking something of God, which a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> need not necessarily be. It may be merely an act of adoration, of confession, of recital of God's mercies, and so on. So as regards <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, here rendered "intercessions." There is nothing in the etymology/ or in the use of this word, which only occurs elsewhere in the New Testament in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-5.htm">1 Timothy 4:5</a>, to limit the meaning of it to "intercession." Nor has it this meaning in the passage where it occurs in the Liturgy of St. Clement, near the close, where God is addressed as <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "Who understandest the petitions even of those who are silent." In 2 Macc. 4:8 and Diod. Sic., 16:55 it seems to mean "a request preferred in a personal interview," which is an extension of its common meaning in classical Greek of "access," "an interview," "social intercourse," or the like. But when we turn to the use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> in the New Testament, we seem to get the idea of "intercession." <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is to go to someone to ask him to take action <span class="accented">against</span> or <span class="accented">in favor of</span> some third party (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-24.htm">Acts 25:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-27.htm">Romans 8:27, 28, 34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>); and so Chrysostom (quoted in Steph., 'Thesaur.') explains <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to be the action of one who applies to God to avenge him of those who have done him wrong. So that perhaps "intercessions" is, on the whole, the best rendering here, though an imperfect one; and would comprise the prayers for the emperor, for the Church, for the sick, travelers, slaves, captives, etc., for the bishops, clergy, and laity, etc., and such prayers as "Turn away from us every plot (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>) of wicked men" (Liturgy of St. Mark). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 The disciples of Christ must be praying people; all, without distinction of nation, sect, rank, or party. Our duty as Christians, is summed up in two words; godliness, that is, the right worshipping of God; and honesty, that is, good conduct toward all men. These must go together: we are not truly honest, if we are not godly, and do not render to God his due; and we are not truly godly, if not honest. What is acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, we should abound in. There is one Mediator, and that Mediator gave himself a ransom for all. And this appointment has been made for the benefit of the Jews and the Gentiles of every nation; that all who are willing may come in this way, to the mercy-seat of a pardoning God, to seek reconciliation with him. Sin had made a quarrel between us and God; Jesus Christ is the Mediator who makes peace. He is a ransom that was to be known in due time. In the Old Testament times, his sufferings, and the glory that should follow, were spoken of as things to be revealed in the last times. Those who are saved must come to the knowledge of the truth, for that is God's appointed way to save sinners: if we do not know the truth, we cannot be ruled by it.</body></html>
