Though their life duties must be different from those of men--yet for them, too, as for men, there was one glorious goal; but for them--the women of Christ--the only road to the goal was the faithful, true carrying out of the quiet home duties he had just sketched out for them. In other words, women will win the great salvation; but if they would win it, they must fulfil their destiny; they must acquiesce in all the conditions of a woman's life--in the forefront of which St. Paul places the all-important functions and duties of a mother.<p>This is apparently the obvious meaning of the Apostle's words--all <span class= "ital">this</span> lies on the surface--but beneath all this the reverent reader can hardly fail to see another and deeper reference (the presence of the article, "through <span class= "ital">the</span> childbearing," gives us the clue)--"she shall be saved by THE childbearing" (the Incarnation) by the relation in which woman stood to the Messiah, in consequence of the primal prophecy that her seed (not man's) should bruise the serpent's head (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm" title="And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.">Genesis 3:15</a>), the peculiar function of her sex, from its relation to her Saviour, "shall be the medium of her salvation." (See Bishop Ellicott, <span class= "ital">in loco.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">If they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.</span>--But let no one think that the true saintly woman, painted with such matchless skill by St. Paul, satisfies the conditions of her life by merely fulfilling the duties of a mother.<p>She must besides, if she would win her crown, hold fast to the Master's well-known teaching, which enjoins on all His own disciples, men as well as women, faith and love, holiness and modesty. The last word, "modesty," or <span class= "ital">discretion, </span>or <span class= "ital">sobriety</span> (all poor renderings of the Greek <span class= "ital">sophrosune, </span>which includes, besides, the idea of a fight with and a victory over self), brings back the thoughts to the beautiful Pauline conception of a true woman, who wins her sweet and weighty power in the world by self-effacement.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - But for <span class="accented">notwithstanding</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">through the child-bearing</span> for <span class="accented">in child-bearing</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">love</span> for <span class="accented">charity</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">sanctification</span> for <span class="accented">holiness</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">She shall be saved</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. the woman</span> generically. The transition from the personal <span class="accented">Eve</span> to the generic <span class="accented">woman</span> is further marked by the transition from the singular to the plural, "if they continue," etc. The natural and simple explanation of the passage is that the special temporal punishment pronounced against the woman, immediately after her sin, "In sorrow shalt thou bring forth children" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>) - (to which St. Paul here evidently alludes) - and endured by all women ever since, was a set-off, so to speak, to the special guilt of Eve in yielding to the guile of the serpent; so that now the woman might attain salvation as well as the man (although she was not suffered to teach)if she continued in faith and charity. <span class="cmt_word">The child-bearing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); here only; but the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, which occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-14.htm">1 Timothy 5:14</a>, is found (though very rarely) in classical Greek.

The reference to the birth of Christ - the Seed of the woman - which some commentators Hammond, Peile, Wordsworth, Ellicott, etc.; not Bengel, Alford. or the German school generally) see here, is rather strained, and anyhow cannot be proved without an inspired interpreter. The stress which is laid by some of the above on the use of the definite article here has no justification (see <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-5.htm">2 Peter 1:5-7</a>, where even the R.V. does not think of translating "the virtue," "the knowledge," "<span class="accented">the</span> temperance," etc.). Nor is the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span>, which Alford and others press, "<span class="accented">through</span>," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "in spite of," like <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-15.htm">1 Corinthians 3:15</a>, at all probable from the context.

We must pray in our closets, pray in our families, pray at our meals, pray when we are on journeys, and pray in the solemn assemblies, whether more public or private. We must pray in charity; without wrath, or malice, or anger at any person. We must pray in faith, without doubting, and without disputing. Women who profess the Christian religion, must be modest in apparel, not affecting gaudiness, gaiety, or costliness. Good works are the best ornament; these are, in the sight of God, of great price. Modesty and neatness are more to be consulted in garments than elegance and fashion. And it would be well if the professors of serious godliness were wholly free from vanity in dress. They should spend more time and money in relieving the sick and distressed, than in decorating themselves and their children. To do this in a manner unsuitable to their rank in life, and their profession of godliness, is sinful. These are not trifles, but Divine commands. The best ornaments for professors of godliness, are good works. According to St. Paul, women are not allowed to be public teachers in the church; for teaching is an office of authority. But good women may and ought to teach their children at home the principles of true religion. Also, women must not think themselves excused from learning what is necessary to salvation, though they must not usurp authority. As woman was last in the creation, which is one reason for her subjection, so she was first in the transgression. But there is a word of comfort; that those who continue in sobriety, shall be saved in child-bearing, or with child-bearing, by the Messiah, who was born of a woman. And the especial sorrow to which the female sex is subject, should cause men to exercise their authority with much gentleness, tenderness, and affection.</body></html>
