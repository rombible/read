"I will therefore" expresses on St. Paul's part no mere wish or desire, but it is the expression of his solemn apostolical authority. It might be rendered, <span class= "ital">I desire therefore.</span><p><span class= "bld">That men pray every where . . .</span>--Better rendered, <span class= "ital">in every place.</span> The greater liberty which women, under the teaching of Christ, had enjoyed; the new position they occupied in the Christian commonwealth; the distinguished services many of them had been permitted to accomplish in the Master's service--in such instances as the Marys, Dorcas, Priscilla, Lydia, and others--had no doubt contributed to a certain self-assertion on the part of female converts in the Ephesian congregations, which threatened grave disorders in the conduct of divine worship. St. Paul, in his directions respecting divine service in the Christian assemblies, follows the custom here of the Jewish synagogue, where women were forbidden to speak. Men, said St. Paul, in every place where a congregation in the name of Christ was gathered together, were to be the offerers of prayer. The word "everywhere" seems a memory of the Lord's words to the woman of Samaria, "Believe me, the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father."<p><span class= "bld">Lifting up holy hands.</span>--It was the Jewish practice, not only in taking a solemn oath--or in blessing--but also in prayer, to lift up the hands--Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-2.htm" title="Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry to you, when I lift up my hands toward your holy oracle.">Psalm 28:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-4.htm" title="Thus will I bless you while I live: I will lift up my hands in your name.">Psalm 63:4</a>. This seems to have been generally adopted by the early Christians as the attitude in prayer. See Clem. Rom., <span class= "ital">To the Corinthians, </span>chap. 29 "<span class= "ital">Holy hands</span>;" see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-4.htm" title="He that has clean hands, and a pure heart; who has not lifted up his soul to vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.">Psalm 24:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-6.htm" title="I will wash my hands in innocence: so will I compass your altar, O LORD:">Psalm 26:6</a>; "holy"--that is, unstained with wanton sins.<p><span class= "bld">Without wrath and doubting.</span>--Here allusion is doubtless made to religious disputes and contentions among the believers themselves--"doubting" is better translated by <span class= "ital">disputing.</span> These angry feelings can have no place in the heart of one who really prays, whether in public or in private.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="accented">Desire</span> for <span class="accented">will</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the men</span> for <span class="accented">men</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">in every place</span> for <span class="accented">everywhere</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">disputing</span> for <span class="accented">doubting</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">I desire</span>, etc. He takes up the subject again which he had opened in ver. 1, but had somewhat digressed from in vers. 4-7, and gives further directions as to the persons who are to make the prayers spoken of in ver. 1, viz. men (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>), not women, as it follows more at large in vers. 9-15. The stress is clearly upon "men" (or, "the men" - it makes no difference); and there is no force in Alford's remark that in that case it would have been <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The prayers had been already ordered in ver. 1; the additional detail, that they were to be offered by men, is now added. <span class="cmt_word">In every place;</span> not, as Chrysostom thinks, in contrast to the Jewish worship, which was confined to the temple at Jerusalem, but merely meaning wherever a Christian congregation is assembled. <span class="cmt_word">Lifting up holy hands.</span> Alford quotes Clem. Ram. 'To the Corinthians,' Ep. 1. 1 Timothy 29: <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-6.htm">Psalm 26:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a>; 43:20; 63:4; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-12.htm">2 Chronicles 6:12, 13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Without wrath.</span> It appears from several passages in Chrysostom that the habit of praying angry prayers was not unknown in his day. "<span class="accented">Do</span> you pray against your brother? But your prayer is not against him, but against yourself. You provoke God by uttering those impious words, 'Show him the same;' 'So do to him;' 'Smite him;' 'Recompense him;' and much more to the same effect" ('Hom.' 6.). In 'Hom.' 8. his comment on this passage is: "Without bearing malice.... Let no one approach each God in enmity, or in an unsalable temper." <span class="cmt_word">And disputing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). The exact meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is perhaps best seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-21.htm">Luke 5:21, 22</a>, where both the verb and the substantive are used. The <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> are <span class="accented">carillings</span>, <span class="accented">questionings</span> proceeding from a captious, unbelieving spirit. They are <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-19.htm">Matthew 15:19</a>). The word is always used in a bad sense in the New Testament. Forms of prayer were not yet established in the Church, but these cautious show the need of them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-15 Under the gospel, prayer is not to be confined to any one particular house of prayer, but men must pray every where. We must pray in our closets, pray in our families, pray at our meals, pray when we are on journeys, and pray in the solemn assemblies, whether more public or private. We must pray in charity; without wrath, or malice, or anger at any person. We must pray in faith, without doubting, and without disputing. Women who profess the Christian religion, must be modest in apparel, not affecting gaudiness, gaiety, or costliness. Good works are the best ornament; these are, in the sight of God, of great price. Modesty and neatness are more to be consulted in garments than elegance and fashion. And it would be well if the professors of serious godliness were wholly free from vanity in dress. They should spend more time and money in relieving the sick and distressed, than in decorating themselves and their children. To do this in a manner unsuitable to their rank in life, and their profession of godliness, is sinful. These are not trifles, but Divine commands. The best ornaments for professors of godliness, are good works. According to St. Paul, women are not allowed to be public teachers in the church; for teaching is an office of authority. But good women may and ought to teach their children at home the principles of true religion. Also, women must not think themselves excused from learning what is necessary to salvation, though they must not usurp authority. As woman was last in the creation, which is one reason for her subjection, so she was first in the transgression. But there is a word of comfort; that those who continue in sobriety, shall be saved in child-bearing, or with child-bearing, by the Messiah, who was born of a woman. And the especial sorrow to which the female sex is subject, should cause men to exercise their authority with much gentleness, tenderness, and affection.</body></html>
