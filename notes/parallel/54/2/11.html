The very questioning on difficult points is forbidden them at the public assembly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-35.htm" title="And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.">1Corinthians 14:35</a>). So averse was St. Paul to anything which might mar the quiet solemnity of these meetings for prayer and praise and authoritative instruction.<p>This prohibition to speak publicly in assemblies for prayer and praise in the case of Christian women, was renewed in the North African Church, at the Council of Carthage, held A.D. 398. The same Council, however, specially permitted women to teach those of their own sex in private; indeed, the power to teach "ignorant and rustic women" was required as one qualification in deaconesses. The employment of deaconesses as private instructors seems to have been the custom generally in the Eastern Churches.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="accented">A</span> for <span class="accented">the</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">quietness</span> for <span class="accented">silence</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Quietness</span> is not so good a rendering as "silence," because the <span class="accented">quietness</span> here meant is <span class="accented">silence</span>, as appears clearly by the parallel direction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-34.htm">1 Corinthians 14:34</a>.

It is used of the subjection of the wife to her husband (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-34.htm">1 Corinthians 14:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-18.htm">Colossians 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-5.htm">Titus 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-15 Under the gospel, prayer is not to be confined to any one particular house of prayer, but men must pray every where. We must pray in our closets, pray in our families, pray at our meals, pray when we are on journeys, and pray in the solemn assemblies, whether more public or private. We must pray in charity; without wrath, or malice, or anger at any person. We must pray in faith, without doubting, and without disputing. Women who profess the Christian religion, must be modest in apparel, not affecting gaudiness, gaiety, or costliness. Good works are the best ornament; these are, in the sight of God, of great price. Modesty and neatness are more to be consulted in garments than elegance and fashion. And it would be well if the professors of serious godliness were wholly free from vanity in dress. They should spend more time and money in relieving the sick and distressed, than in decorating themselves and their children. To do this in a manner unsuitable to their rank in life, and their profession of godliness, is sinful. These are not trifles, but Divine commands. The best ornaments for professors of godliness, are good works. According to St. Paul, women are not allowed to be public teachers in the church; for teaching is an office of authority. But good women may and ought to teach their children at home the principles of true religion. Also, women must not think themselves excused from learning what is necessary to salvation, though they must not usurp authority. As woman was last in the creation, which is one reason for her subjection, so she was first in the transgression. But there is a word of comfort; that those who continue in sobriety, shall be saved in child-bearing, or with child-bearing, by the Messiah, who was born of a woman. And the especial sorrow to which the female sex is subject, should cause men to exercise their authority with much gentleness, tenderness, and affection.</body></html>
