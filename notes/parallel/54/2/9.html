"Likewise," he goes on to say, "I desire that women, when they pray"--women also in the congregation had their duties as well as the men--while the latter were directed to conduct and lead the public prayer, the women who worshipped with them were enjoined, as their part of the solemn service, to be present, adorned with neatness of apparel and modesty of demeanour, and the holy reputation of kind deeds.<p><span class= "bld">Adorn themselves in modest apparel.</span>--This direction to Christian women was not intended to apply to their ordinary dress in the world, but simply explained to the sisters of the Ephesian flock that their place in public worship was one of quiet attention--that their reverence and adoration must be shown not by thrusting themselves forward with a view to public teaching or public praying, but by being present and taking part silently--avoiding especially in these services anything like a conspicuous dress or showy ornaments--anything, in fact, which would be likely to arouse attention, or distract the thoughts of others.<p><span class= "bld">With shamefacedness and sobriety.</span>--These expressions denote the inward feelings with which the Apostle desires the devout Christian women to come to divine service; the first signifies "the innate shrinking from anything unbecoming." The second, sobriety, includes the idea of self-restraint--the conquest over all wanton thought and desire.<p><span class= "bld">Not with broided hair.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-3.htm" title="Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;">1Peter 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-24.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.">Isaiah 3:24</a>. "Broided:" the modern form is "braided." Some modern editions give "broidered," apparently by mistake.<p><span class= "bld">Or gold.</span>--Probably, the "gold" is supposed to be twined among the plaits of the hair. These elaborate adornments, so likely to catch the eye at divine worship, were quite inconsistent with Christian simplicity, besides being calculated to distract the attention of their fellow worshippers, male as well as female. On this question of seemly, quiet apparel, in an assembly gathered for divine worship, see the difficult verse, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-10.htm" title="For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.">1Corinthians 11:10</a>, where <span class= "ital">another</span> and a still graver reason for modest demeanour and apparel of women is alleged--"because of the angels."<p><span class= "bld">Pearls, or costly array.</span>--Ear-rings, necklaces, bracelets, are included here; these costly ornaments were worn by the ladies of the luxurious age in which St. Paul lived, in great profusion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="accented">In like manner</span> for <span class="accented">in like manner also</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">braided</span> for <span class="accented">broided</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and gold</span> for or <span class="accented">gold</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">raiment</span> for <span class="accented">array</span>, A.V. The apostle here passes on to the duties of women as members of the congregation, and he places first modesty of demeanor and dress, the contrary to these being likely to prove a hurt and a hindrance to their fellow-worshippers. <span class="cmt_word">Adorn themselves in modest apparel.</span> This is obviously the true construction, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> depending upon <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>.

Alford argues strongly in favor of the meaning "apparel." But it may also mean "steadiness" or "quietness" of demeanor; and then the phrase will be exactly parallel to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-5.htm">1 Peter 3:5</a>, "The incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit." And the meaning will be, "Let Christian women adorn themselves with a decent and well-ordered quietness of demeanor, in strict accordance with [or, 'together with'] shame-fastness and sobriety [<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>, 'in strict accord with,' or 'together with'] not with braided hair," etc. A woman's true ornament is not the finery which sire gets from the milliner, but the chaste discretion which she has from the Spirit of God. <span class="cmt_word">Modest</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); only found in the New Testament here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>, where it is rendered" of good behavior" in the A.V., and "modest" in the margin, "orderly" in the R.V.

So the edition of 1611; "shamefacedness" in the later editions is a corruption.

We must pray in our closets, pray in our families, pray at our meals, pray when we are on journeys, and pray in the solemn assemblies, whether more public or private. We must pray in charity; without wrath, or malice, or anger at any person. We must pray in faith, without doubting, and without disputing. Women who profess the Christian religion, must be modest in apparel, not affecting gaudiness, gaiety, or costliness. Good works are the best ornament; these are, in the sight of God, of great price. Modesty and neatness are more to be consulted in garments than elegance and fashion. And it would be well if the professors of serious godliness were wholly free from vanity in dress. They should spend more time and money in relieving the sick and distressed, than in decorating themselves and their children. To do this in a manner unsuitable to their rank in life, and their profession of godliness, is sinful. These are not trifles, but Divine commands. The best ornaments for professors of godliness, are good works. According to St. Paul, women are not allowed to be public teachers in the church; for teaching is an office of authority. But good women may and ought to teach their children at home the principles of true religion. Also, women must not think themselves excused from learning what is necessary to salvation, though they must not usurp authority. As woman was last in the creation, which is one reason for her subjection, so she was first in the transgression. But there is a word of comfort; that those who continue in sobriety, shall be saved in child-bearing, or with child-bearing, by the Messiah, who was born of a woman. And the especial sorrow to which the female sex is subject, should cause men to exercise their authority with much gentleness, tenderness, and affection.</body></html>
