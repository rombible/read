Our prayers after all--for those far off, as well as for those near--will be in strict harmony with the will of God. "Imitate God," writes St. Chrysostom;" if He wills that all men should be saved, it is surely natural that prayer should be offered for all; if <span class= "ital">He</span> willed that all should be saved, do <span class= "ital">thou</span> will it now; and if in earnest thou wiliest it, then pray."<p>One or two points must ever be held in mind when this great statement of St. Paul's is used as a proof of "Universal Redemption." We must remember the position it occupies in the argument, it being only introduced as a reason for the exhortation to pray for all. Then the words must be looked at very carefully. God's-will is not to save (<span class= "ital">s?sai</span>) all--if <span class= "ital">that</span> had been His sovereign will He <span class= "ital">would</span> have saved all; but His will is that all should be saved--all should come to the knowledge of the truth; not to the knowledge of the mere theoretical, but of the practical and saving truth as revealed in the gospel. "In other words, through the sacrifice and the death of Christ <span class= "ital">all</span> are rendered capable of salvation (<span class= "ital">salvabiles</span>); that some are indisputably not saved, is not due to any outward circumscription or inefficacy of the divine will, but to man's rejection of the special means of salvation which God has been pleased to appoint, and to which it is His divine will that man's salvation should be limited. Redemption is universal, yet conditional--all <span class= "ital">may</span> be saved, yet all <span class= "ital">will</span> not be saved, because all will not conform to God's appointed condition."--<span class= "ital">Bishop</span> <span class= "ital">Ellicott.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="accented">Willeth that all men should be saved for will have all men to be saved</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">come to</span> for <span class="accented">to come unto</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>All men</span>, etc.; to show that it is in accordance with God's will to pray for "all men" (ver. 1).

Our duty as Christians, is summed up in two words; godliness, that is, the right worshipping of God; and honesty, that is, good conduct toward all men. These must go together: we are not truly honest, if we are not godly, and do not render to God his due; and we are not truly godly, if not honest. What is acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, we should abound in. There is one Mediator, and that Mediator gave himself a ransom for all. And this appointment has been made for the benefit of the Jews and the Gentiles of every nation; that all who are willing may come in this way, to the mercy-seat of a pardoning God, to seek reconciliation with him. Sin had made a quarrel between us and God; Jesus Christ is the Mediator who makes peace. He is a ransom that was to be known in due time. In the Old Testament times, his sufferings, and the glory that should follow, were spoken of as things to be revealed in the last times. Those who are saved must come to the knowledge of the truth, for that is God's appointed way to save sinners: if we do not know the truth, we cannot be ruled by it.</body></html>
