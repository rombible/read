It no doubt also includes the "laying on of hands" customary, apparently, even in the Apostolic age, on the absolution of penitents and their re-admission to church fellowship.<p><span class= "bld">Neither be partaker of other men's sins.</span>--By thus negligently admitting into the ministry unfit persons--by carelessly and without due caution readmitting persons to a church fellowship, which by their evil life they had forfeited--Timothy would incur a grave responsibility, would in fact "be a partaker" in the sins and errors committed by those men, some of whom he had carelessly placed in important positions in the church, others of whom he had restored to communion before they had given sufficient evidence of their repentance. To limit, however, the reference of the command of St. Paul here to the laying on of hands in the ordination of presbyters and deacons, would imply a greater corruption in the church at that early date than is credible. Surely the number of "unfit" persons seeking the high and holy, but difficult and dangerous, posts of officers in a proscribed and hated community, would hardly by themselves have warranted such grave warning words as "Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins."<p><span class= "bld">Keep thyself pure.</span>--The word "pure" here has a broad and inclusive signification. It, of course, denotes the urgent necessity of one holding Timothy's high and responsible office being pure and chaste in word and deed and thought; but here it also presses on the chief presbyter of Ephesus the imperative necessity of keeping himself, by ceaseless watchfulness, pure from all reproach in the matter of selecting candidates for the ministry, or in the restoring of the lapsed sinners to church fellowship.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="accented">Hastily</span> for <span class="accented">suddenly</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Lay hands</span>, etc. Surely if we are guided by St. Paul's own use of the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, in the only two places in his writings where it occurs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-14.htm">1 Timothy 4:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6</a>), we must abide by the ancient interpretation of these words, that they mean the laying on of hands in ordination. So also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-6.htm">Acts 6:6</a> and Acts 13:3, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> is "to ordain." And the context here requires the same sense. The solemn injunction in the <span class="accented">pre</span>ceding verse, to deal impartially in judging even the most influential eider, naturally suggests the caution not to be hasty in ordaining any one to be an elder. Great care and previous inquiry were necessary before admitting any man, whatever might be his pretensions or position, to a holy office. A bishop who, on the spur of the moment, with improper haste, should ordain cue who afterwards required reproof as <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, sinning (ver. 20), would have a partnership in the man's sin, and in the evil consequences that flowed from it. And then it follows, <span class="cmt_word">Keep thyself pure</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> clear and guiltless (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-11.htm">2 Corinthians 7:11</a>), which he would not be if he was involved in the sin of the guilty elder. Observe that the stress is upon "thyself." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:17-25 Care must be taken that ministers are maintained. And those who are laborious in this work are worthy of double honour and esteem. It is their just due, as much as the reward of the labourer. The apostle charges Timothy solemnly to guard against partiality. We have great need to watch at all times, that we do not partake of other men's sins. Keep thyself pure, not only from doing the like thyself, but from countenancing it, or any way helping to it in others. The apostle also charges Timothy to take care of his health. As we are not to make our bodies masters, so neither slaves; but to use them so that they may be most helpful to us in the service of God. There are secret, and there are open sins: some men's sins are open before-hand, and going before unto judgment; some they follow after. God will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make known the counsels of all hearts. Looking forward to the judgment-day, let us all attend to our proper offices, whether in higher or lower stations, studying that the name and doctrine of God may never be blasphemed on our account.</body></html>
