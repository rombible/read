St. Paul has been directing his son in the faith, and successor in the government of the chief Asian Church, carefully to watch for, and to reward by dignity and honour, the services of the more zealous and distinguished presbyters. He now tells him that the other matters, besides zeal and successful service among the Church's professed officers, will come before him when he stands at the helm of the Church. Charges--owing, possibly, to jealousy, party feeling, suspected doctrinal error--will not unfrequently be brought against a presbyter. Such an accusation is only to be received by Timothy when the evidence is perfectly clear. Every possible precaution against simply vexatious charges brought against one occupying the hard and difficult position of a presbyter, must be taken by the presiding minister. The reference is to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-6.htm" title="At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.">Deuteronomy 17:6</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="accented">Except at the mouth of</span> for <span class="accented">but before</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">An elder</span>; here clearly a presbyter, as the context proves. <span class="cmt_word">Receive</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>); <span class="accented">give ear to</span>, <span class="accented">entertain</span>; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-18.htm">Acts 22:18</a>, "They will not <span class="accented">receive</span> thy testimony." <span class="cmt_word">At the mouth of</span>, etc. There is a reference to the law in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-30.htm">Numbers 35:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>, and elsewhere (to which our Lord also refers, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-17.htm">John 8:17</a>), and St. Paul applies the principle of the law to Timothy's dealings with presbyters who might be accused of not "ruling well." He was not to encourage <span class="accented">delatores</span>, secret accusers and defamers, but if any one had a charge to make against a ruler, it was to be done <span class="accented">in the presence</span> of witnesses (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> with a genitive). A doubt arises whether" the witnesses" here spoken of were to be witnesses able to support the accusation, or merely witnesses in whose presence the accusation must be made. The juxtaposition of the legal terms <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> favors the strict meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, witnesses able to support the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. And, therefore, the direction to Timothy is, "Suffer no man to accuse a presbyter unless he is accompanied by two or three witnesses who are ready to back up the accusation." The italic <span class="accented">the mouth of</span>, in the R.V., is not necessary or indeed justified. There is no ellipsis of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x1fc3;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x1fde;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "<span class="accented">before</span> two or three witnesses," is good classical Greek. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:17-25 Care must be taken that ministers are maintained. And those who are laborious in this work are worthy of double honour and esteem. It is their just due, as much as the reward of the labourer. The apostle charges Timothy solemnly to guard against partiality. We have great need to watch at all times, that we do not partake of other men's sins. Keep thyself pure, not only from doing the like thyself, but from countenancing it, or any way helping to it in others. The apostle also charges Timothy to take care of his health. As we are not to make our bodies masters, so neither slaves; but to use them so that they may be most helpful to us in the service of God. There are secret, and there are open sins: some men's sins are open before-hand, and going before unto judgment; some they follow after. God will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make known the counsels of all hearts. Looking forward to the judgment-day, let us all attend to our proper offices, whether in higher or lower stations, studying that the name and doctrine of God may never be blasphemed on our account.</body></html>
