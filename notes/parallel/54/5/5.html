We find also that, in the first years which succeeded the Ascension, many <span class= "ital">widows</span> in Jerusalem seemed to have been dependent on the Church for sustenance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.">Acts 6:1</a>). Now we should expect to find in the Church of Christ the same loving care which was taken in the old days, when Israel was a great nation, of these solitary and unhappy women. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-17.htm" title="You shall not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge:">Deuteronomy 24:17</a>, where we find special laws respecting the garments of widows never to be taken in pledge. See, too, such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-22.htm" title="You shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.">Exodus 22:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-19.htm" title="Cursed be he that perverts the judgment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen.">Deuteronomy 27:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-17.htm" title="Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.">Isaiah 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-6.htm" title="If you oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt:">Jeremiah 7:6</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-2.htm" title="To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless!">Isaiah 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-5.htm" title="And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:5</a>.) Still, this hardly accounts for the statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.">Acts 6:1</a> and these lengthened directions to Timothy. It is more than probable that there were, especially in these Eastern cities, a very large class of these desolate and unprotected women. The practice of polygamy is accountable for this, in the first instance; and the rigid morality of the Christian teaching would place a bar to the female convert from heathenism relapsing into a life where moral restraints were utterly disregarded. The charities of the early Church, especially in Oriental cities, were, without doubt, heavily burdened with this grave and increasing charge--provision for these poor desolate women; and it was to relieve the congregations in some degree that St. Paul wrote these elaborate instructions to Timothy, warning him, as the chief minister of the Ephesian Church, against an indiscriminate charity, and at the same time providing him with a system of severe restraints to be imposed upon the assisted women.<p>Still, the chief pastor in Ephesus must remember that among the women of his flock there were <span class= "ital">some</span> widows indeed, with neither children nor grandchildren to assist them, without friends even to cheer their desolate, widowed life. To find out and to succour these poor, sad-hearted, friendless beings, St. Paul reminds Timothy, was one of the duties of a Christian minister.<p><span class= "bld">Trusteth in</span> <span class= "bld">God.</span>--These, without love of child or friend, cast themselves on the support of the everlasting arms. The language here used by St. Paul pictures, evidently, some loving and trustful character then living, of whom he was thinking while writing the Letter to Timothy. "<span class= "ital">She hath</span> trusted and still trusts in God; she continues in prayer night and day."<p><span class= "bld">And continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.</span>--Like Anna, the daughter of Phanuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/2-36.htm" title="And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;">Luke 2:36-37</a>), whom some suppose St. Paul took as the model and example for these Christian widows. The meaning of these words, descriptive of a holy life, is not that the earnest and pious bereaved woman should pass her days and nights in the unrelieved monotony of constantly repeated prayers. Such a life, unpractical and useless, would never commend itself to one like St. Paul; the words simply describe the desolate one casting all her care on the Lord, and telling Him, as her only friend, of all her thoughts and actions, her words and her works.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="accented">Hath her hope set on</span> for <span class="accented">trusteth</span> in, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">A widow indeed</span> (see ver. 3). <span class="cmt_word">Desolate</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>; only here in the New Testament, rare in Greek versions of Old Testament, frequent in classical Greek); literally, <span class="accented">left alone</span>, or <span class="accented">made solitary</span>, which is also the exact meaning of "desolate," from <span class="accented">solus</span>, alone. A widow with children or grandchildren able to support her is not altogether desolate. As regards the connecting <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>, rendered "now" both in the A.V. and the R.V., Bishop Ellicott rightly renders it "but." The apostle is contrasting the condition of the <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, who has only God to look to for help, and who passes her time in prayer, with that of the widow with children and grandchildren. The second "but" in ver. 6 is no real objection; the widow who "giveth herself to pleasure ' is contrasted in her turn with the devout prayerful widow whose conduct has just been described. The inference intended to be drawn, as Ellicott justly remarks, is that the one is eminently fit, and the other eminently unfit, to be supported at the common charge of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">Hath her hope set on God</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-10.htm">1 Timothy 4:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Supplications and prayers</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-1.htm">1 Timothy 2:1</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">Night and day.</span> Perhaps <span class="accented">by night and by day</span> would express the genitive better (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-14.htm">Matthew 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-7.htm">Luke 18:7</a>), as indicating time <span class="accented">when</span>, rather than time <span class="accented">how long</span>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-37.htm">Luke 2:37</a>, Anna the prophetess is said to worship "with lastings and supplications night and day (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>)," where the accusative conveys rather more the notion of vigils prolonged through the night. As regards the order of the words, "day and night," or "night and day," there seems to be no rule. St. Mark always has "night and day" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-7.htm">Mark 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-5.htm">Mark 5:5</a>); St. Luke uses both (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-37.htm">Luke 2:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-7.htm">Luke 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-24.htm">Acts 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-7.htm">Acts 26:7</a>). St. Paul always "night and day," as in this passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-3.htm">2 Timothy 1:3</a>). St. John always "day and night" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-15.htm">Revelation 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-11.htm">Revelation 14:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:3-8 Honour widows that are widows indeed, relieve them, and maintain them. It is the duty of children, if their parents are in need, and they are able to relieve them, to do it to the utmost of their power. Widowhood is a desolate state; but let widows trust in the Lord, and continue in prayer. All who live in pleasure, are dead while they live, spiritually dead, dead in trespasses and sins. Alas, what numbers there are of this description among nominal Christians, even to the latest period of life! If any men or women do not maintain their poor relations, they in effect deny the faith. If they spend upon their lusts and pleasures, what should maintain their families, they have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels. If professors of the gospel give way to any corrupt principle or conduct, they are worse than those who do not profess to believe the doctrines of grace.</body></html>
