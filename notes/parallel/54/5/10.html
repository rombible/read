It must not, of course, be supposed that St. Paul deemed it necessary to exclude from the order of presbyteral widows the childless mothers. Only the candidate for admission must be well known as one who loves children, and would be ready and willing gladly to discharge any public duties to the little orphan ones of the flock who might be intrusted to her care.<p><span class= "bld">If she have lodged strangers.</span>--If, even in a comparatively humble state, she have been always mindful of the sacred rites of hospitality, a virtue perhaps even more valued in the East than in the more reserved Western countries. In the early days of the new faith, the readiness to entertain and welcome Christian strangers seems to have been an especial characteristic of believers in Jesus of Nazareth.<p><span class= "bld">If she have washed the saints' feet.</span>--Not perhaps to be understood literally, though the act of the Lord on the night before the Cross had invested this act of common hospitality with a peculiar halo of love and devotion. The woman who was to be admitted into the fellowship of this honoured order must be well known as one who had never shrunk from any act of devoted love, however painful or seemingly degrading.<p><span class= "bld">If she have relieved the afflicted.</span>--Not merely, or even chiefly, by alms, but by all kindly and sisterly encouragement: ever ready to mourn with those that mourn, deeming none too low or too degraded for her friendship, none out of the reach of her sisterly help and counsel.<p><span class= "bld">If she have diligently followed every good work.</span>--This sums up the beautiful character to be sought for in the candidates for membership in this chosen woman's band. She must be known not merely as a mother and a wife, who had well and faithfully performed the womanly duties of her home life, but men must speak of her as one who had diligently and lovingly sought out the rough places of the world, and who, with a brave and patient self-denial, with a sweet and touching self-forgetfulness, had set herself to perform those kind, good actions the Master loves so well.<p>In the <span class= "ital">Shepherd of Hermas, </span>written about A.D. 150, some eighty years after St. Paul wrote this letter to Timothy, we have probably an example of one of these honoured widows in the person of Grapte, whose task it was to teach the widows and orphans of the Roman Church the meaning of certain prophecies. The authorship of the <span class= "ital">Shepherd</span> has also been ascribed to the Hermas mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-14.htm" title="Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brothers which are with them.">Romans 16:14</a>. It belongs, however, more probably to the middle of the second century, as stated above.<p>The criticism which dwells on this celebrated passage, containing St. Paul's rules for admission into the order of presbyteral widows, and which finds in it subject matter belonging to a date later than the age of St. Paul and Timothy, forgets that, dating from the days when Jesus of Nazareth walked on earth, women had been enrolling themselves among His foremost followers, and had been sharing in the toils and enterprises of His most zealous disciples. We find the Marys and other holy women associated with "His own" in the days of the earthly ministry; they were foremost in the work done to the person of the sacred dead. We hear of them after the Resurrection repeatedly in the Jerusalem Church of the first days. It was the neglect of some of the Hebrew widows which led to the foundation of the deacon's order. Dorcas, before ten years of the Church's life had passed, appears to have presided over a charitable company of women at Lydda. Dorcas, no doubt, was but one out of many doing, in different centres, a similar work. Priscilla, the wife of Aquila, the wandering tent-maker of Pontus, early in St. Paul's career evidently took a leading part in organising congregations of Christians. Lydia, the purple seller of Thyatira, was prominent in developing the Philippian Church. Phebe, under the title of the Deaconess of Cenchrea, was the official bearer of St. Paul's famous letter to the Roman Church. This passage, dwelling on the growing organisation for women's work at Ephesus, tells us more, certainly, than the scattered incidental allusions of the Acts and earlier Epistles. But the words of St. Paul speak only of the natural results and development of a great movement, which, dating from the earthly days of the ministry of Christ, was destined to give women a new position among the workers of the world.<p>The Ephesian organisation here regulated by the Apostle is nothing more than we should expect to find after thirty or thirty-two years of female effort in the Master's cause.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="accented">Hath</span> for <span class="accented">have</span>, A.V.

This use is frequent in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-8.htm">Hebrews 7:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-2.htm">Hebrews 11:2, 4, 5, 39</a>), also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-6.htm">3 John 1:6, 12</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Good works</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). The phrase occurs frequently in the pastoral Epistles, both in the singular and in the plural (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-10.htm">1 Timothy 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-1.htm">1 Timothy 3:1</a>; in this verse; ver. 25; 6:18; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-21.htm">2 Timothy 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-17.htm">2 Timothy 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-16.htm">Titus 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-7.htm">Titus 2:7, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-1.htm">Titus 3:1, 8, 14</a>). Our Lord had first used the phrase, and taught how "good works" were to be the distinctive marks of his disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>), as they were evidences of his own mission (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-32.htm">John 10:32, 33</a>). It denotes all kinds of good <span class="accented">actions</span> as distinguished from <span class="accented">sentiments</span>. Love, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> is not a <span class="accented">good work</span>. Feeding the hungry and clothing the naked and visiting the sick are <span class="accented">good works</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Brought up children</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); only here in the New Testament or LXX., but found, as well as <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, in Aristotle. The word must mean "brought up children of her own," because <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> does not mean "a child" with reference to its age, but "a child" with reference to its parent who bare it. The only apparent exception in Holy Scripture is <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:7</a>, where the nurse's <span class="accented">alumni</span> are called "her own children," but obviously this is no rent exception. The classical usage is the same. We must, therefore, understand the apostle here to mean "if she hath brought up her children well and carefully, and been a good mother to them." The precept corresponds to that laid down for an <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4</a>.

Those who would find mercy when they are in distress, must show mercy when they are in prosperity; and those who show most readiness for every good work, are most likely to be faithful in whatever is trusted to them. Those who are idle, very seldom are only idle, they make mischief among neighbours, and sow discord among brethren. All believers are required to relieve those belonging to their families who are destitute, that the church may not be prevented from relieving such as are entirely destitute and friendless.</body></html>
