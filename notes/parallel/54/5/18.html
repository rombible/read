The ox was not to be hindered from eating some portion of the grain which he was treading out. The preacher of the gospel was to live of the gospel. <span class="cmt_word">The laborer is worthy of his hire</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f51;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-10.htm">Matthew 10:10</a> the words are the same as here, except that <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> (his meat) is substituted for <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a> the words are identical with those here used, even to the omission (in the R.T.) of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. The conclusion is inevitable that the writer of this Epistle was acquainted with and quoted from St. Luke's Gospel; and further, that he deemed it, or at least the saying of the Lord Jesus recorded, in it, to be of equal authority with "<span class="greek">&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>," the Scripture. If this Epistle was written by St. Paul after his first imprisonment at Rome, we may feel tolerably certain that he was acquainted with the Gospel or St. Luke, so that there is no improbability in his quoting from it. His reference to another saying of the Lord Jesus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a> gives additional probability to it. The passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a> seems also to be a direct reference to the Lord's Prayer, as contained in the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Luke. St. Paul does not directly call the words <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, only treats them as of equal authority, which, if they were the words of Christ, of course they were. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:17-25 Care must be taken that ministers are maintained. And those who are laborious in this work are worthy of double honour and esteem. It is their just due, as much as the reward of the labourer. The apostle charges Timothy solemnly to guard against partiality. We have great need to watch at all times, that we do not partake of other men's sins. Keep thyself pure, not only from doing the like thyself, but from countenancing it, or any way helping to it in others. The apostle also charges Timothy to take care of his health. As we are not to make our bodies masters, so neither slaves; but to use them so that they may be most helpful to us in the service of God. There are secret, and there are open sins: some men's sins are open before-hand, and going before unto judgment; some they follow after. God will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make known the counsels of all hearts. Looking forward to the judgment-day, let us all attend to our proper offices, whether in higher or lower stations, studying that the name and doctrine of God may never be blasphemed on our account.</body></html>
