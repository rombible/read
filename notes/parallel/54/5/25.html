St. Paul bids him take courage in the thought that in many a case self-sacrifice, generosity, stern principle, will be sufficiently manifest to guide him in his choice of fit persons for the holy calling; and in those rarer cases where the higher and sweeter virtues are hidden, he may be sure that in God's good season these too <span class= "ital">will</span> become known to him, in ample time for him to call them also into his Master's service.<p><span class= "bld">EXCURSUS ON NOTES TO I. TIMOTHY.<p>ON A SUGGESTED INTERPRETATION OF CHAPTER 5:25.</span><p>IT has been suggested, with considerable ingenuity, that <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-25.htm" title="Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.">1Timothy 5:25</a> belongs to, and is an introduction of, a new division of the Epistle, where the Apostle gives Timothy instructions respecting certain teachings to be addressed to different ranks in the Christian society of Ephesus. The connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-24.htm" title="Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.">1Timothy 5:24</a> then would be--as it is in the case of sins, so, too, it is in the case of good works. These latter are not always on the surface distinguishable. Some, of course, are manifest, but there is many a noble life the secrets of which will only come to light at the last day--"they cannot be hid" THEN. And this is too often the case with that unhappy class (the slaves), "those under the yoke," of whom the Apostle was about to speak (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/6-1.htm" title="Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.">1Timothy 6:1-2</a>). It is possible that St. Paul meant here to turn Timothy's attention especially to those in slavery, that he might diligently search out the noblest and most devoted, and ordain (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-22.htm" title="Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep yourself pure.">1Timothy 5:22</a>) them to perform sacred duties, so that each class--the slaves as well as the rich and well-born--should possess representatives among the ordained ministers. This is at least possible when we consider the vast number of slaves--not a few of them, too, possessing high culture--in the world known by St. Paul and Timothy.<p>In connection with, but not necessarily linked with, this thought is an interpretation of the general subject matter of the sixth chapter, which views the whole as instructions to the three broad divisions into which Christian society of the first century may be said to have been roughly divided:--<p>(1) SLAVES . . .<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-25.htm" title="Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.">1Timothy 5:25</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-3.htm" title="If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;">1Timothy 6:3</a>. Instructions respecting <span class= "ital">slaves, </span>who possessed nothing of their own.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/6-4.htm" title="He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof comes envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,">1Timothy 6:4-5</a>. The allusion to the false teachers, whose teaching respecting slavery was very different from his.<p>(2) MIDDLE CLASS.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/6-6.htm" title="But godliness with contentment is great gain.">1Timothy 6:6-16</a>. St. Paul introduces the warning against covetousness and the wish to be rich, the special danger of <span class= "ital">the middle class</span>--the free, but who were the reverse of wealthy--to which order Timothy belonged. Then followed<p>(3) THE RICH<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/6-17.htm" title="Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy;">1Timothy 6:17-19</a>. Special instructions to the <span class= "ital">rich and the highly horn.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="accented">In</span> <span class="accented">like maturer</span> for <span class="accented">likewise</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">there are good works that are evident</span> for <span class="accented">the good works of some are manifest beforehand</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">such as</span> for <span class="accented">they that</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">There are good works</span>, etc. It is much best to understand <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, as the A.V. does, and render <span class="accented">the good works of some</span>, answering to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of ver. 24. <span class="cmt_word">Such as are otherwise</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, not manifest beforehand - <span class="cmt_word">cannot be hid.</span> "They will be seen and recognized some time or other" (Ellicott). Alford seems to catch the true spirit of the passage when he says, "<span class="accented">The</span> tendency of this verse is to warn Timothy against hasty condemnation, as the former had done against hasty approval. Sometimes thou wilt find a <span class="accented">man's</span> good character go before him.... but where this is not so.... be not rash to condemn: thou mayest on examination discover it there be any good deeds accompanying him: for they... cannot be hidden." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:17-25 Care must be taken that ministers are maintained. And those who are laborious in this work are worthy of double honour and esteem. It is their just due, as much as the reward of the labourer. The apostle charges Timothy solemnly to guard against partiality. We have great need to watch at all times, that we do not partake of other men's sins. Keep thyself pure, not only from doing the like thyself, but from countenancing it, or any way helping to it in others. The apostle also charges Timothy to take care of his health. As we are not to make our bodies masters, so neither slaves; but to use them so that they may be most helpful to us in the service of God. There are secret, and there are open sins: some men's sins are open before-hand, and going before unto judgment; some they follow after. God will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make known the counsels of all hearts. Looking forward to the judgment-day, let us all attend to our proper offices, whether in higher or lower stations, studying that the name and doctrine of God may never be blasphemed on our account.</body></html>
