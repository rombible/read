And, first, he warns him against a misplaced zeal, which might urge him to unbefitting behaviour towards those older than himself. The enthusiastic and ardent young servant of Christ would see with sorrow and dismay the shortcomings of many an elder member of his flock, and, forgetting to make wise allowance for previous training, thought, and habits, would be likely, unwisely, and possibly unfairly, to find fault. Let him, in the cases of his elders--for the reference is rather to age than to office, as is clear from the reminder of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-2.htm" title="The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.">1Timothy 5:2</a>, addressed to the "elder women"--instead of open rebuke, use respectful and affectionate entreaties, after the manner of a son, not of an official.<p><span class= "bld">The younger men as brethren.</span>--And as regards the younger Christians of Ephesua, let them not be alienated by an assumption of dignity on the part of the chief presbyter of the Church. Let his relations with these younger members of the family of Christ be rather those of a brother and a friend than of a superior in rank and dignity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="accented">Exhort</span> for <span class="accented">intreat</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and</span> omitted. <span class="cmt_word">Rebuke not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>); only here in the New Testament for the more usual <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>, and frequently in the Gospels) or <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;</span>, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-13.htm">Titus 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-15.htm">Titus 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-19.htm">Revelation 3:19</a>, and elsewhere. In classical Greek it expresses a sharp castigation with words. Compare the "patruae verbera linguae" (Hor., 'Od.,' 3. 12:3). It answers to the Latin <span class="accented">objurgo</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>An elder</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x1ff3;</span>). The context shows that the meaning is not a "presbyter," but "an old man." The precept has relation to Timothy's youth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>). See the same order in respect to the persons to be admonished (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-1.htm">Titus 2:1-6</a>, where, however, we have the forms <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>). The direction is an instance of that admirable propriety of conduct, based upon a true charity, which vital Christianity produces. A true Christian never forgets what is due to others, never "behaves himself unseemly." <span class="cmt_word">Exhort</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>); certainly a much better rendering than <span class="accented">intreat</span> in the A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The younger men.</span> This and the other accusatives in this and the following verse are governed by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>; the prohibitive <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3be;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span> Is con- lined to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>As brethren.</span> This phrase shows that Timothy was still a young man himself. Observe, too, how even m reproving the sense of love is to be main- mined. The members of the Church over which he rules are either fathers and mothers, or brothers and sisters, or, it may be added, as his own children, to the faithful pastor. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1,2 Respect must be paid to the dignity of years and place.
