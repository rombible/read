He now passes to the question how to deal with these responsible officers of the Church when they were proved to be notoriously sinning. While, on the one hand, the earnest and devoted men were to be honoured with "a double honour"--while every possible <span class= "ital">legal</span> precaution was to be taken in the case of those being accused--on the other hand, when proved to be men continuing in sin and error, their punishment must be as marked as in the other case was the reward. The errors and sins of teachers of the faith are far more dangerous than in those who make up the rank and file of congregations, and require a more severe and more public punishment.<p>It is not improbable that St. Paul was especially alluding here to false teaching--to errors of doctrine on the part of some of the Ephesian presbyters. He seems, in his parting address at Miletus to the elders (presbyters) of this very Ephesian Church, to have foreseen such a grievous falling away in the future among their company--"Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-30.htm" title="Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.">Acts 20:30</a>). Compare also the Epistle to this same Church of Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/2-4.htm" title="Nevertheless I have somewhat against you, because you have left your first love.">Revelation 2:4-5</a>). As the sin, whatever has been its nature, has been committed by men intrusted with a responsible and public charge, so the rebuke and punishment must also be in public, that the warning may then spread over the whole of the various congregations composing the Church, and thus "others also may fear."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="accented">Reprove</span> for <span class="accented">rebuke</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">in the sight of</span> for <span class="accented">before</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the rest</span> for <span class="accented">others</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">be in fear</span> for <span class="accented">fear</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Reprove</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3be;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span>, as in ver. 1 (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15</a>). There, the fault being a private one, the reproof is to be administered in private. But in the case of the sinning presbyter, which is that here intended, Timothy is to reprove the offender "before all," that others also may fear, and may be deterred by their fear from committing a like offence. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:17-25 Care must be taken that ministers are maintained. And those who are laborious in this work are worthy of double honour and esteem. It is their just due, as much as the reward of the labourer. The apostle charges Timothy solemnly to guard against partiality. We have great need to watch at all times, that we do not partake of other men's sins. Keep thyself pure, not only from doing the like thyself, but from countenancing it, or any way helping to it in others. The apostle also charges Timothy to take care of his health. As we are not to make our bodies masters, so neither slaves; but to use them so that they may be most helpful to us in the service of God. There are secret, and there are open sins: some men's sins are open before-hand, and going before unto judgment; some they follow after. God will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make known the counsels of all hearts. Looking forward to the judgment-day, let us all attend to our proper offices, whether in higher or lower stations, studying that the name and doctrine of God may never be blasphemed on our account.</body></html>
