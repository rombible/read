Then, in those early days, as now, men and women were attempting to persuade themselves that the hopes and promises of Christians could be attained and won by a mere profession of faith, by an assent to the historical truths, by a barren reception of the doctrine of the atonement, without any practice of stern self-denial, apart from any loving consideration for others; there were evidently in that great Church of Ephesus, which St. Paul knew so well not a few professed believers in the Crucified who, while possessed themselves of a competence, perhaps even of wealth, could calmly look on while their relations and friends languished in the deepest poverty.<p><span class= "bld">And specially for those of his own house.</span>--The circle of those for whose support and sustenance a Christian was responsible is here enlarged: not merely is the fairly prosperous man who professes to love Christ, bound to do his best for his nearest relations, such as his mother and grandmother, but St. Paul says "he must assist those of his own house," in which term relatives who are much more distant are included, and even dependents connected with the family who had fallen into poverty and distress.<p><span class= "bld">He hath denied the faith.</span>--Faith, considered as a rule of life, is practically denied by one who neglects these kindly duties and responsibilities, for "faith worketh by love" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-6.htm" title="For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.">Galatians 5:6</a>). Faith here is considered by St. Paul, not as mere belief in the doctrine, or even in a person, but as a rule of life.<p><span class= "bld">And is worse than an infidel.</span>--The rules even of the nobler Pagan moralists forbid such heartless selfishness. For a Christian, then, deliberately to neglect such plain duties would bring shame and disgrace on the religion of the loving Christ, and, notwithstanding the name he bore, and the company in which he was enrolled, such a denier of the faith would be really worse than a heathen.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="accented">Provideth</span> for <span class="accented">provide</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">his own household</span> for <span class="accented">those of his own house</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">unbeliever</span> for <span class="accented">infidel</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Provideth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>).

It is the duty of children, if their parents are in need, and they are able to relieve them, to do it to the utmost of their power. Widowhood is a desolate state; but let widows trust in the Lord, and continue in prayer. All who live in pleasure, are dead while they live, spiritually dead, dead in trespasses and sins. Alas, what numbers there are of this description among nominal Christians, even to the latest period of life! If any men or women do not maintain their poor relations, they in effect deny the faith. If they spend upon their lusts and pleasures, what should maintain their families, they have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels. If professors of the gospel give way to any corrupt principle or conduct, they are worse than those who do not profess to believe the doctrines of grace.</body></html>
