The Greek word <span class= "ital">krima</span> is often thus unhappily translated. The context of the passage must in all cases decide the nature of the "judgment," whether favourable or the contrary. Here it signifies that those who in after days give up a work which for their Master's sake they had undertaken, expose themselves to a searching judgment, which will thoroughly sift the reasons that induced them to forsake the begun toil, and that, if the reasons be not satisfactory, will be unfavourable, and will surely involve condemnation.<p><span class= "bld">Because they have cast off their first faith.</span>--Though, probably, no vows respecting marriage were required from those widows who devoted themselves to the Lord's service, yet virtually such a solemn enrolment partook of the nature of a life-long engagement--an engagement which, if they married again, must necessarily be given up.<p>Such a going back, such a giving up the higher and the more devoted life--the life of self-sacrifice, of self-abnegation--for the ordinary joys and cares of domestic life, for the useful but still every-day pursuits of ordinary men and women--such a going back, would be indeed a casting off their first faith, and such an example of backsliding could not fail to harm the cause of Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="accented">Condemnation</span> for <span class="accented">dare</span>, <span class="accented">ration</span>, A.V,; <span class="accented">rejected</span> for <span class="accented">cast off</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Condemnation</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, variously translated in the A.V. "damnation," "condemnation," and "judgment." The word means a "judgment," "decision," or "sentence," but generally an adverse sentence, a "condemnation." And this is the meaning of the English word "damnation," which has only recently acquired the signification of "eternal damnation." <span class="cmt_word">Rejected</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">have set aside</span>, or <span class="accented">displaced</span>, and hence <span class="accented">disregarded</span>, an oath, treaty, promise, or the like. In the A.V. variously rendered "reject," "despise," "bring to nothing," "frustrate," "disannul," "east off." The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> which these widows Brought upon themselves was that, whereas they had devoted themselves to a life of prayer and special service of the Church, they had now set aside this their first faith, and returned to the ordinary pleasures and avocations of the world. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:9-16 Every one brought into any office in the church, should be free from just censure; and many are proper objects of charity, yet ought not to be employed in public services. Those who would find mercy when they are in distress, must show mercy when they are in prosperity; and those who show most readiness for every good work, are most likely to be faithful in whatever is trusted to them. Those who are idle, very seldom are only idle, they make mischief among neighbours, and sow discord among brethren. All believers are required to relieve those belonging to their families who are destitute, that the church may not be prevented from relieving such as are entirely destitute and friendless.</body></html>
