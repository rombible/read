St. Paul now returns and closes the subject on which he had been instructing his representative at Ephesus. He tells him, in his choice of men to fill the public positions in the Church of God--in his public inquiries into their conduct and teaching--in his inquiries respecting sinners, who, having forfeited their position as members of the community, were seeking re-admission into church fellowship, not to forget there were <span class= "ital">two</span> classes of sins: the one class public and open, heralds, so to speak, of the judgment to follow. In the case of men sinning thus, the church's chief pastor would have no difficulty in determining upon his course of action. But there was another class of sins--silent and, as far as public and general knowledge went, unknown--only published after judgment had been given. To rightly estimate such characters will require much care and penetration, and <span class= "ital">this</span> will be part of Timothy's work. The judgment (<span class= "ital">krisis</span>) here mentioned is that of Timothy as shown in the careful selection of candidates for ordination--in determining what sinners are fit for restoration to church fellowship--in pronouncing sentence in the matter of accused presbyters.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="accented">Evident</span> for <span class="accented">open beforehand</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">unto</span> for <span class="accented">to</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">men also</span> for <span class="accented">men</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Some men's sins</span>, etc. St. Paul is evidently here recurring to the topic which he had been dealing with ever since ver. 17, viz. Timothy's duty as a bishop, to whom was entrusted the selection of persons for the office of elder, or presbyter, and also the maintaining of discipline among his clergy. Alford sees the connection of the precept about drinking a little wine with what went before, and with this twenty-fourth verse, in the supposed circumstance that Timothy's weak health had somewhat weakened the vigor of his rule; and that the recommendation to leave off water-drinking was given more with a view to the firmer discharge of those duties than merely for his bodily comfort. This may be so. But there is nothing unlike St. Paul's manner in the supposition that he had done with the subject in hand at the end of the twenty-second verse, and passed on to the friendly hint with regard to Timothy's health, but then subjoined the fresh remarks in vers. 24 and 25, which were an afterthought. <span class="cmt_word">Evident</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); only found in the New Testament, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-14.htm">Hebrews 7:14</a> besides these two verses, and in the apocryphal books of the Old Testament. It is common, with the kindred forms, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., in classical Greek. It is doubted whether <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> in this compound verb has the force of "beforehand," as in the A.V., and not rather that of "before the eyes of all," and therefore only intensifies the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>. But the natural force of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> in composition certainly is "before" in point of time; and hence in a compound like <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> would mean" evident before it is examined," which of course is equivalent to "very evident." St. Paul's meaning, therefore, would be: Some men's sins are notorious, requiring no careful inquisition in order to find them out; nay, they of themselves go before - before the sinner himself - unto judgment. But there are also some whose sins follow after them. It is not till after close inquiry that they are found out. They go up to the judgment-seat apparently innocent, but after a while their sins come trooping up to their condemnation. This enforces the caution, "Lay hands hastily on no man." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:17-25 Care must be taken that ministers are maintained. And those who are laborious in this work are worthy of double honour and esteem. It is their just due, as much as the reward of the labourer. The apostle charges Timothy solemnly to guard against partiality. We have great need to watch at all times, that we do not partake of other men's sins. Keep thyself pure, not only from doing the like thyself, but from countenancing it, or any way helping to it in others. The apostle also charges Timothy to take care of his health. As we are not to make our bodies masters, so neither slaves; but to use them so that they may be most helpful to us in the service of God. There are secret, and there are open sins: some men's sins are open before-hand, and going before unto judgment; some they follow after. God will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make known the counsels of all hearts. Looking forward to the judgment-day, let us all attend to our proper offices, whether in higher or lower stations, studying that the name and doctrine of God may never be blasphemed on our account.</body></html>
