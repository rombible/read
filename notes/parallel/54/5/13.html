Learn to be idle (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). This is a construction which has no similar passage in Greek to support it, except one very doubtful one in Plato, 'Euthudemus' (vol. 4. p. 105, Bekker's edit.). But the other constructions proposed, viz. to construe <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>, "they are inquisitive, or, curious," as Grotius and substantially Bengel; or to take <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>, "they learn to go about" (Vulgate, De Wette, etc.), cannot be justified by examples either, as <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> has always either an accusative ease or an infinitive mood after it, unless it is used in quite a different sense, as in the passage from Herod., 3:1, quoted by Alford: <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "You are slandered without being aware of it." In this difficulty it is best to take the sense given in the A.V. and the R.V., following Chrysostom, etc., and of moderns Winer, Ellicott, Alford, etc., which the general turn and balance of the sentence favors. <span class="cmt_word">Going about</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); comp. Acts 29:13, where there is the same idea of <span class="accented">reproach</span> in the term. It is used in a good sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Tattlers</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); only here in the New Testament, and once only in the LXX. (4 Macc. 5:10), but common in classical Greek. It means "a trifling silly talker." The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-10.htm">3 John 1:10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Busybodies</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-19.htm">Acts 19:19</a> in the New Testament or LXX., but not uncommon in classical Greek, in the sense in which it is used here. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:11</a> in the same sense, "meddling with what does not concern you." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:9-16 Every one brought into any office in the church, should be free from just censure; and many are proper objects of charity, yet ought not to be employed in public services. Those who would find mercy when they are in distress, must show mercy when they are in prosperity; and those who show most readiness for every good work, are most likely to be faithful in whatever is trusted to them. Those who are idle, very seldom are only idle, they make mischief among neighbours, and sow discord among brethren. All believers are required to relieve those belonging to their families who are destitute, that the church may not be prevented from relieving such as are entirely destitute and friendless.</body></html>
