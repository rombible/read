The word in the Greek rendered "she that liveth in pleasure" is very remarkable, and in the New Testament is found only in one other place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-5.htm" title="You have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; you have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.">James 5:5</a>). The widow-woman who could so forget her sorrow and her duty is spoken of as a living corpse, and sharply contrasted with her far happier sister, who, dead to the pleasures of the flesh, living a life of prayer and of self-denial, in the true sense of the word, may be spoken of as living. A very different estimate of <span class= "ital">life</span> was held by the greatest of Greek poets, who writes thus of men giving up pleasures: "I do not consider that such a one <span class= "ital">lives, </span>but I regard him as a <span class= "ital">living corpse" </span>(<span class= "ital">Antigone</span> of Sophocles, 1166-7, Dindorf). Comp., too, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-1.htm" title="And to the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things said he that has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know your works, that you have a name that you live, and are dead.">Revelation 3:1</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="accented">Giveth herself to</span> for <span class="accented">liveth in</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Giveth herself to pleasure</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>); only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-5.htm">James 5:5</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> "taken your pleasure," R.V., "been wanton," A.V.) in the New Testament, but found (as well as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) in Ecclus. 21:15, and in Polybius (Liddell and Scott). Trench ('Synonyms of New Testament,' p. 191) compares and contrasts <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span>, and says that the latter includes the idea of prodigality. The word brings into the strongest possible contrast the widow who was like Anna, and those whom St. Paul here denounces. <span class="cmt_word">Is dead while she liveth</span>; or, <span class="accented">has died</span> (is dead) <span class="accented">in her lifetime</span>. She is dead to God, and, as Alford suggests, is no longer a living member of the Church of Christ. Compare St. Jude's expression "twice dead" (ver. 12). The expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-1.htm">Revelation 3:1</a> is different, unless <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> here can have the same meaning as <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc7;</span>, "though nominally alive as a Christian," etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:3-8 Honour widows that are widows indeed, relieve them, and maintain them. It is the duty of children, if their parents are in need, and they are able to relieve them, to do it to the utmost of their power. Widowhood is a desolate state; but let widows trust in the Lord, and continue in prayer. All who live in pleasure, are dead while they live, spiritually dead, dead in trespasses and sins. Alas, what numbers there are of this description among nominal Christians, even to the latest period of life! If any men or women do not maintain their poor relations, they in effect deny the faith. If they spend upon their lusts and pleasures, what should maintain their families, they have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels. If professors of the gospel give way to any corrupt principle or conduct, they are worse than those who do not profess to believe the doctrines of grace.</body></html>
