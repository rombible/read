Those who had put their hands to the plough and afterwards looked back, he proceeds to tell us, would be a hindrance to the Church's work, and in some cases might prove a subject of scandal and reproach.<p><span class= "bld">For when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ.</span>--The Apostle was looking on to the time when, the first fervour excited by grief and sorrow being past, these younger sisters in many instances would begin again to long after their old pursuits and pleasures. The Greek word rendered "wax wanton" suggests especially the idea of restiveness. They will lose--to use Jerome's well-known expression--their love for their own proper Bridegroom--Christ.<p><span class= "bld">They will marry.</span>--The sight of domestic happiness enjoyed by other women will affect them. They, too, will long in their poor hearts for home joys; they will weary for the prattle of their own little children.<p>How much untold misery would have been avoided--how many wasted lives would have been saved for good and useful service, had Churchmen in later times only obeyed the words and carried out the thoughts of Paul, and persistently refused, as did St. Paul and Timothy, to receive the proffered services of women still too young in years for such devoted work, but who, through a temporary pressure of sorrow, dreamed for a moment they would be able to carry out their purpose of a life-long renunciation of the world, its excitement and its joys.<p>St. Paul, writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, saw how too often such renunciation, made under peculiar pressure of circumstances, undertaken with the hot fervour of youth, in later days would become weary and distasteful.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="accented">Younger</span> for <span class="accented">the younger</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">waxed</span> for <span class="accented">began to wax</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">desire to</span> for <span class="accented">will</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Refuse</span>. Note the wisdom of Paul, who will not have the young widows admitted into the roll of Church widows, lest, after the first grief for the loss of their husbands has subsided, they should change their minds, and wish to return to the world and its pleasures, and so incur the guilt of drawing back their hands from the plough. Would that the Church had always imitated this wisdom and this consideration for the young, whether young priests or young monks and nuns! <span class="cmt_word">Waxed wanton against</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>). This word only occurs here, but the simple <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-7.htm">Revelation 18:7, 9</a>, and is used by the Greek poets of the new comedy in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span>, to be luxurious (Schleusner, 'Lex.'). Trench ('Synonyms of New Testament'), comparing this word with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span>, ascribes to it the sense of "petulance" from fullness, like the state of Jeshurun, who waxed fat and kicked (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>); and so Liddell and Scott give the sense of "to be over-strong." The sense, therefore, is that these young widows, in the wantonness and unsubdued worldliness of their hearts, reject the yoke of Christ, and kick against the widow's life of prayer and supplication day and night. And so they return to the world and its pleasures, which they had renounced. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:9-16 Every one brought into any office in the church, should be free from just censure; and many are proper objects of charity, yet ought not to be employed in public services. Those who would find mercy when they are in distress, must show mercy when they are in prosperity; and those who show most readiness for every good work, are most likely to be faithful in whatever is trusted to them. Those who are idle, very seldom are only idle, they make mischief among neighbours, and sow discord among brethren. All believers are required to relieve those belonging to their families who are destitute, that the church may not be prevented from relieving such as are entirely destitute and friendless.</body></html>
