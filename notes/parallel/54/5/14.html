St. Paul's practical mind, guided by the Spirit of God, has left us no impossible rules of perfection, no exaggerated praises of asceticism, of lofty self-denial, no passionate exhortings to a life made up entirely of self-sacrifice and of self-surrender.<p>He knew the ordinary man or woman was incapable of such exalted heroism, and therefore was too wise, too loving, even to recommend a life which few could live. It was not that the Master, Christ, and the greatest of his servants, St. Paul, did not themselves prize and admire the higher ideal and the nobler life--for was it not their own? Did not one attain to it, and the other die in his hero-efforts to reach it? But Master and scholar in their gospel of the world have left commands that all, not the few, can obey--have enjoined a life which all, not the few, may live.<p><span class= "bld">Give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.</span>--The reference here is not to the devil--as would at first appear probable from the direct reference in the next verse--but to the enemy of Christ--the sneering worldly man, who, jealous of a faith which he declines to receive, and envious of a life in which he will not share, is always on the look-out to discover flaws and failings in the avowed professors of a religion which he hates.

In ver. 11 we have <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> which precedes is a further proof that this direction or command of the apostle's springs from what he had just been saying about the young widows, and therefore that what follows relates to them, and not to women generally. In order to avoid the scandal mentioned in ver. 11 of the young widows first dedicating their widowhood to Christ, and then drawing back and marrying, he directs that they should follow the natural course and marry, in doing which they would be blameless. <span class="cmt_word">Bear children</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>): here only in the New Testament or LXX.; but <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-15.htm">1 Timothy 2:15</a> (where see note). <span class="cmt_word">Rule the household</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>; here only in this sense); act the part of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, the mistress of a family (Plutarch and elsewhere). <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> frequent in the New Testament, and kindred words are used in classical Greek. <span class="cmt_word">For reviling</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>).

Any misconduct on the part of Christian widows would give him the occasion he was looking for. They must be doubly careful, therefore, lest they should bring reproach upon the Name of Christ (camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-7.htm">James 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-4.htm">1 Peter 4:4, 14, 15</a>).

Do not give the adversary a starting-point from which he may be able to carry out his desire to revile the people of God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:9-16 Every one brought into any office in the church, should be free from just censure; and many are proper objects of charity, yet ought not to be employed in public services. Those who would find mercy when they are in distress, must show mercy when they are in prosperity; and those who show most readiness for every good work, are most likely to be faithful in whatever is trusted to them. Those who are idle, very seldom are only idle, they make mischief among neighbours, and sow discord among brethren. All believers are required to relieve those belonging to their families who are destitute, that the church may not be prevented from relieving such as are entirely destitute and friendless.</body></html>
