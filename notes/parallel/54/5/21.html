"Lord" must be omitted before Jesus Christ, the older authorities not containing the word. The sense of the passage remains the same. Very solemnly is Timothy adjured to carry out the varied duties of his great charge, the government of the Church of Ephesus, impartially--doing nothing hastily, ever watchful of himself. St. Paul has just pressed upon him how needful it was to exercise care in the case of an accused presbyter. He must listen to no charge except several competent witnesses were produced to support the accusation. He now reminds Timothy--the chief <span class= "ital">presbyter</span>--of the ever present unseen witnesses of <span class= "ital">his</span> conduct (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-1.htm" title="Why seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which does so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,">Hebrews 12:1</a>). In that awful presence--in sight of the throne of God, with Messiah on the right hand, and the angels, the chosen attendants and ministers of God, gathering round about the throne--would Timothy guide and rule the congregations of Christians in that famous Eastern city.<p>The Church of Ephesus had been built up and consolidated by the personal presence and influence of St. Paul, resident there some three years; and at the time when St. Paul wrote to Timothy it was second in numbers and in influence to none of the early groups of congregations (except, perhaps, to the Christian communities of Syrian Antioch). Placed by an Apostle as the first head of such a community, intrusted with one of the greatest and most important charges in Christendom, Timothy indeed needed to be watchful. Well might St. Paul remind him of the tremendous witnesses who would be present in <span class= "ital">his</span> hour of trial.<p><span class= "bld">And the elect angels.</span>--St. Paul had been speaking of the internal organisation of the church on earth, and had been dwelling, first, on rank and order among women, and secondly, among men, especially directing that a special position of honour should be given to the more distinguished and zealous of the presbyteral order. The term "elect" here given to certain of those blessed spirits--in whose sight, as they stood and ministered before the throne of God, Timothy would rule over the charge committed to him--would seem to imply that, as on earth, so in heaven are there degrees in rank and variety in occupation. These holy ones are probably termed "elect" as especially selected by the Eternal as His messengers to the human race, as was Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-19.htm" title="And the angel answering said to him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak to you, and to show you these glad tidings.">Luke 1:19</a>.) St. Paul loves to refer to the ranks and degrees of the host of heaven. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-38.htm" title="For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,">Romans 8:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm" title="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>.) But it is possible that these "elect angels" were those blessed spirits who "kept their first estate," and had not fallen. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm" title="For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved to judgment;">2Peter 2:4</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-6.htm" title="And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness to the judgment of the great day.">Jude 1:6</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">That thou observe these things.</span>--The "things" Timothy was to observe, as ever in the presence of so august a company of witnesses, were the varied points touched upon in the preceding verses, relating to the internal organisation of the church over which he was presiding, especially bearing in mind (for St. Paul again refers to this point) his words which bore upon judgment of presbyters--the men whose lives and conversation were to be an example to the flock.<p><span class= "bld">Without preferring one before another.</span>--More literally, <span class= "ital">without prejudice.</span> He who presides over a great Christian community must be above all <span class= "ital">party</span> feeling. That unhappy divisions existed in the churches, even in the lifetime of the Apostles, we have ample evidence, not only in the inspired writings, but also in the fragments we possess of the earliest Christian literature.<p><span class= "bld">Doing nothing by partiality.</span>-Although these reminding words, and those immediately preceding, were written with especial reference to the judicial inquiry Timothy would be constrained to hold in the event of any presbyter being formally accused either of a moral offence or of grave doctrinal error in his teaching, yet they must be understood in a far broader sense. The presiding elder in Ephesus must never forget that he bears rule, not only over one school of Christian thought, but over <span class= "ital">all</span> men who acknowledged Jesus as Messiah and Redeemer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="accented">In the sight of</span> for <span class="accented">before</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Christ Jesus</span> for <span class="accented">the Lord Jesus Christ</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">prejudice</span> for <span class="accented">preferring one before another</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">I charge thee</span>, etc. It has been well remarked that the solemnity of this charge indicates the temptation which there might be to Timothy to shrink front reproving men of weight and influence" rulers" in the congregation, and "elders" both in age and by office, young as he himself was (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>). Perhaps he had in view some particular case in the Ephesian Church. <span class="cmt_word">Charge</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>; not <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-13.htm">1 Timothy 6:13</a>); rather, <span class="accented">I adjure thee</span>. The strict sense of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is "I call heaven and earth to witness the truth of what I am saying;" and then, by a very slight metonymy, "I declare a thing," or "I ask a thing," "as in the presence of those witnesses who are either named or understood." Here the witnesses are named: God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-14.htm">2 Timothy 2:14</a> it is "the Lord;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-1.htm">2 Timothy 4:1</a> God and Jesus Christ, as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-13.htm">1 Timothy 6:13</a>. In the passages where the word has the force of "testifying" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-18.htm">Luke 16:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-40.htm">Acts 2:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-42.htm">Acts 10:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>, etc.), no witnesses are named, but great solemnity and earnestness are implied. <span class="cmt_word">The elect angels.</span> This is the only passage where it is predicated of the angels that they are <span class="accented">elect</span>. But as there is repeated mention in Holy Scripture of the fallen angels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-3.htm">1 Corinthians 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7, 9</a>), the obvious interpretation is that St. Paul, in this solemn adjuration, added the epithet to indicate more distinctly the "<span class="accented">holy</span> <span class="accented">angels</span>," as they are frequently described (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-26.htm">Luke 9:26</a>, etc.), or "the angels of God" or "<span class="accented">of</span> heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-30.htm">Matthew 22:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-36.htm">Matthew 24:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-8.htm">Luke 12:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-51.htm">John 1:51</a>). Possibly the mention of Satan in ver. 15, or some of the rising Gnostic opinions about angels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>), may have suggested the epithet. The reason for the unusual addition of "the angels" is more difficult to adduce with certainty. But perhaps <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-1.htm">2 Timothy 4:1</a> gives us the clue, where the apostle shows that in appealing to Jesus Christ he has a special eye to the great and final judgment. Now, in the descriptions of the lust judgment, the angels are constantly spoken of as accompanying our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8.htm">Mark 8</a>:48; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-26.htm">Luke 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-8.htm">Luke 12:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>, etc.). If St. Paul, therefore, had in his mind the great judgment-day when he thus invoked the names of God and of Christ, he would very naturally also make mention of the elect angels. And so Bishop Bull, quoted in the 'Speaker's Commentary.' <span class="cmt_word">Without prejudice</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); here only in the New Testament, and not found in the LXX. or classical Greek, though the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> occurs in both. Although the English word "prejudice" seems at first sight an apt rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, it does not really give the sense so accurately as "preference." We commonly mean by "prejudice" a judgment formed prior to examination, which prevents our judging rightly or fairly when we come to the examination, which, however, is not the meaning of the Latin <span class="accented">praejudicium</span>. But <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> means rather "to prefer" a person, or thing, to others. And therefore <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> means "preference," or "partiality," or, as the A.V. has it, "preferring one before another." The two meanings may be thus expressed. "Prejudice," in the English use of the word, is when a person who has to judge a cause upon evidence prejudges it without evidence, and so does not give its proper weight to the evidence. "Prefer-once" is when he gives different measure to different persons, according as He is swayed by partiality, or interest, or favor. St. Paul charges Timothy to measure out exactly equal justice to all persons alike. <span class="cmt_word">By partiality</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). This also is an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> as far as the New Testament is concerned, and is not found in the LXX., but is found, as well as the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, in classical Greek. It means literally the "inclination" of the scales to one side or the other, and hence a "bias" of the mind to one party or the other. The balance of justice in the hands of Timothy was to be equal. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:17-25 Care must be taken that ministers are maintained. And those who are laborious in this work are worthy of double honour and esteem. It is their just due, as much as the reward of the labourer. The apostle charges Timothy solemnly to guard against partiality. We have great need to watch at all times, that we do not partake of other men's sins. Keep thyself pure, not only from doing the like thyself, but from countenancing it, or any way helping to it in others. The apostle also charges Timothy to take care of his health. As we are not to make our bodies masters, so neither slaves; but to use them so that they may be most helpful to us in the service of God. There are secret, and there are open sins: some men's sins are open before-hand, and going before unto judgment; some they follow after. God will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make known the counsels of all hearts. Looking forward to the judgment-day, let us all attend to our proper offices, whether in higher or lower stations, studying that the name and doctrine of God may never be blasphemed on our account.</body></html>
