The consideration of the position and qualifications of certain ruling elder women (<span class= "ital">the presbyteral widows</span>) reminded St. Paul of certain points to be impressed on Timothy connected with the rank and honour due to the more distinguished presbyters associated with him in the Ephesian congregations.<p>Attention should be directed here to the vast powers intrusted to the "presiding presbyter" of such a Church as Ephesus (to use the <span class= "ital">title</span> of Bishop in the ecclesiastical sense would be as yet an anachronism. It probably was, however, of general use within thirty years from the date of the Epistle, certainly before the close of the century). In addition to the general office of supervisor, one in the position of Timothy evidently had the distribution of the several grades of honours and remuneration among the presbyteral order (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-17.htm" title="Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine.">1Timothy 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-21.htm" title="I charge you before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that you observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.">1Timothy 5:21</a>). To him, as presiding elder, belonged the functions of supreme judge in all matters ecclesiastical and moral, relating to the varied officials of both sexes connected with the Church. The right of ordination which, when the Apostles and the first generation of believers had passed away, became the <span class= "ital">exclusive</span> work of the bishop, is here (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-22.htm" title="Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep yourself pure.">1Timothy 5:22</a>) specially intrusted by an Apostle to Timothy, the chief presbyter and apostolic representative in the Church of Ephesus, in the words: "Lay hands suddenly on no man."<p>The elders (presbyters) to whom Timothy was to accord some special honour, were those who, in the congregations and Christian schools of so great a city as Ephesus, in addition to their many duties connected with organisation and administration, were distinguishing themselves in a marked manner by their preaching and teaching.<p>Among the devoted and earnest presbyters in these Asian churches, some there were, doubtless, who possessed the special gift of teaching, either in the class-room or the preacher's chair. Those who, possessing, well and faithfully exercised these invaluable gifts were to be in some way preferred by the chief minister. The "double honour" (<span class= "ital">time</span>) is a broad inclusive term, and seems to comprehend rank and position as well as remuneration--<span class= "ital">victu et reverentia, </span>as Melancthon paraphrases the words "double honour." Timothy is here directed to confer on the more distinguished of the order of presbyters, official rank and precedence, as the reward of faithful and successful work.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="accented">Those for they</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">in teaching</span> for <span class="accented">doctrine</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The elders</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) here in its technical sense of "presbyters," which in the first age were the ruling body in every Chinch (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-2.htm">Acts 20:2, 4, 6, 22</a>), after the analogy of the elders of the Jews. <span class="cmt_word">Rule well</span> (at <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>). The presbyters or elders were the chiefs, rulers, or presidents, of the Church (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-8.htm">Romans 12:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12</a>; and above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4, 5</a>). It seems that they did not necessarily teach and preach, but those who did so, laboring in the Word and teaching, were especially worthy of honor. <span class="cmt_word">Double honor</span> (see note on ver. 3) means simply increased honor, not exactly twice as much as some one else, or with arithmetical exactness. So the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span> is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-15.htm">Matthew 23:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-6.htm">Revelation 18:6</a>; and by the LXX. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-2.htm">Isaiah 40:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-18.htm">Jeremiah 16:18</a>; and elsewhere also in classical Greek. And so we say, "twice as good," "twice as much," with the same indefinite meaning. <span class="cmt_word">The Word and teaching.</span> The "Word" means generally "the Word of God," as we have "preach the Word," "hear the Word," "the ministry of the Word," "doers of the Word," etc. And although there is no article before <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> here yet, considering the presence of the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, and St. Paul's less careful use of the article in his later Epistles, this absence is not sufficient to counterbalance the weight of those considerations which lead to the conclusion that "laboring in the Word" refers to the Word of God. The alternative rendering of "oral discourse" <span class="accented">or</span> "in speaking" seems rather weak. <span class="cmt_word">Teaching</span> would mean catechetical instruction and similar explanatory teaching. <span class="cmt_word">Labor</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); a word very frequently used by St. Paul of spiritual labors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-6.htm">Romans 16:6, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-11.htm">Galatians 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-29.htm">Colossians 1:29</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:17-25 Care must be taken that ministers are maintained. And those who are laborious in this work are worthy of double honour and esteem. It is their just due, as much as the reward of the labourer. The apostle charges Timothy solemnly to guard against partiality. We have great need to watch at all times, that we do not partake of other men's sins. Keep thyself pure, not only from doing the like thyself, but from countenancing it, or any way helping to it in others. The apostle also charges Timothy to take care of his health. As we are not to make our bodies masters, so neither slaves; but to use them so that they may be most helpful to us in the service of God. There are secret, and there are open sins: some men's sins are open before-hand, and going before unto judgment; some they follow after. God will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make known the counsels of all hearts. Looking forward to the judgment-day, let us all attend to our proper offices, whether in higher or lower stations, studying that the name and doctrine of God may never be blasphemed on our account.</body></html>
