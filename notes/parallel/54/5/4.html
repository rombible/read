In Latin <span class="accented">nepotes</span>, "descendants;" <span class="accented">nos neveux</span> (in French), "our descendants;" and so the English word "nephews" (derived from <span class="accented">nepos</span>, through the French <span class="accented">neveu</span>) properly means, and is commonly so used in all old English writers, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, in Holinshed (Richardson's Dictionary), "their nephews, or sons' sons, which reigned in the third place." Locke's phrase, "a nephew by a brother," seems to show the transition to the modern use of "nephew."

In the only other passage in the New Testament where this word occurs, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-23.htm">Acts 17:23</a>, it has also an accusative of the person - "whom ye worship."

It is the duty of children, if their parents are in need, and they are able to relieve them, to do it to the utmost of their power. Widowhood is a desolate state; but let widows trust in the Lord, and continue in prayer. All who live in pleasure, are dead while they live, spiritually dead, dead in trespasses and sins. Alas, what numbers there are of this description among nominal Christians, even to the latest period of life! If any men or women do not maintain their poor relations, they in effect deny the faith. If they spend upon their lusts and pleasures, what should maintain their families, they have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels. If professors of the gospel give way to any corrupt principle or conduct, they are worse than those who do not profess to believe the doctrines of grace.</body></html>
