It is here used for the congregation of believers among whom God dwells--the true and enduring Church of living souls. Of this great spiritual temple, the corner-stone of which is Christ, the Jerusalem house on Mount Zion, with its marvellous work and its gorgeous and elaborate symbolism, was the poor, perishable, hand-wrought model.<p><span class= "bld">Which is the church of the living God.</span>--The house of God is here plainly defined to be the "Church" (or, <span class= "ital">congregation</span>) "of the <span class= "ital">living</span> God," who was working in its midst actively and personally, in strong contrast to that well-known graven image of the Diana of Ephesus, throned in that fair temple which glittered in its white and lifeless beauty over the roofs of the city where Timothy's charge lay.<p><span class= "bld">The pillar and ground of the truth.</span>--The imagery is here changed, and the "house of God" which the Apostle had just defined to be the Church, or congregation, belonging to the living God, and in the midst of which He was pleased to dwell, is now defined to be "the pillar and ground" (or, <span class= "ital">basis</span>) "of the truth." In the first picture, the Church is painted by St. Paul as a vast congregation, with the living God dwelling in its midst: in the second, the same Church is painted as a massive pillar, holding up and displaying before men and angels <span class= "ital">the</span> <span class= "ital">truth--</span>the saving truth of the gospel. In the first picture, the thought of a great company gathered together for God to dwell among is prominent: in the second, the thought of the great redemption-truth alone comes to the front, and the Church of God is no longer viewed as a company of separate individuals, but as one massive foundation-pillar, supporting and displaying the glories of redemption.<p>This peculiar aspect of the Church, "the support and pillar of the truth," was dwelt upon probably by the Apostle as "defining--with indirect allusion to nascent and developing heresies--the true note, office, and vocation of the Church. . . . Were there no Church, there would be no witness, no guardian of archives, no basis, nothing whereon acknowledged truth could rest" (Ellicott).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - Men <span class="accented">ought to behave themselves</span> for <span class="accented">thou oughtest to behave thyself</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">To behave thyself</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); variously rendered, both in the A.V. and the R.V., "to have one's conversation," "to live," "to pass (one's time)," "to be used" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-33.htm">Hebrews 10:33</a>). It is literally "to go up and down" a given place, "backwards and forwards," hence "to dwell in it." The substantive <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, in the thirteen places where it occurs in the New Testament, is always rendered "conversation" in the A.V.; in the R.V., "manner of life," "life," "issue of life," "<span class="accented">manner</span> of living," "<span class="accented">behaviour</span>," "living." It is a favorite word in the two Epistles of St. Peter, where it occurs eight times. <span class="cmt_word">The house of God.</span> This phrase here denotes, as it is explained in the following words, the Church on earth. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>, "<span class="accented">Christ</span> as a Son over his house; whose house are we," where the reference is to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>, "<span class="accented">My</span> servant Moses... is faithful in all mine house." <span class="cmt_word">The Church of the living God.</span> Here is again a somewhat remarkable resemblance to the phraseology of the Epistle to the Hebrews, "Ye are come unto Mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God.... to the general assembly and Church of the Firstborn" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22, 23</a>). However, the phraseology is not peculiar to the Epistle to the Hebrews. Thus we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>, "<span class="accented">Ye</span> are the temple of the living God." The phrase, "<span class="accented">the</span> living <span class="accented">God</span>," occurs seven times in St. Paul's Epistles, and four times in the Epistle to the Hebrews. It occurs three times in the Gospels, once in the Acts of the Apostles, and once in the Revelation. Here it is used by St. Paul to enhance the obligation to a holy and blameless walk in those who have the oversight of his Church. <span class="cmt_word">The pillar and ground of the truth</span>. Some apply these words to Timothy himself (Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory Nazianzen, Basil, and others cited by Alford), after the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>, where James, Cephas, and John are said to be "pillars" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>, where it is said of him that over-cometh, "I will make him a pillar (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) in the house of my God." And so, in Venantius Fortunatus, St. Paul is called "stilus ille." But the metaphors of "a pillar" and "a foundation" do not all suit the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>; and it is well argued that the absence of the pronoun <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> is unfavorable to the application of "the pillar and ground of the truth" to the subject of the first clause. It is therefore better to understand this clause as descriptive of the Church of God. The Church is the pillar of the truth. It supports it; holds it together - binds together its different parts. And it is the ground of the truth. By it the truth is made fast, firm, and fixed. <span class="cmt_word">The ground</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). This word only occurs here at all; <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, common both in the New Testament, the LXX., and in classical Greek, means "fixed," "firm," or" fast." In the A.V. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-37.htm">1 Corinthians 7:37</a> and 1 Cor 15:58, "steadfast;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a> (where it is coupled with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>), "settled." Thence <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span> in late Greek, "to make firm or fast," and <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, the "establishment" or "grounding" of the truth; that in and by which the truth is placed on a sure and fixed basis. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:14-16 The church is the house of God; he dwells there. The church holds forth the Scripture and the doctrine of Christ, as a pillar holds forth a proclamation. When a church ceases to be the pillar and ground of truth, we may and ought to forsake her; for our regard to truth should be first and greatest. The mystery of godliness is Christ. He is God, who was made flesh, and was manifest in the flesh. God was pleased to manifest himself to man, by his own Son taking the nature of man. Though reproached as a sinner, and put to death as a malefactor, Christ was raised again by the Spirit, and so was justified from all the false charges with which he was loaded. Angels ministered to him, for he is the Lord of angels. The Gentiles welcomed the gospel which the Jews rejected. Let us remember that God was manifest in the flesh, to take away our sins, to redeem us from all iniquity, and to purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. These doctrines must be shown forth by the fruits of the Spirit in our lives.</body></html>
