The old translation perhaps is best. Alford writes strikingly on the change of tense: "They that <span class= "ital">have</span> used <span class= "ital">are</span> acquiring or purchasing." The Apostle having begun by placing himself at the great day of retribution, now shifts the scene and deals with their present conduct. "Those who shall then be found to have served well, &c. . . . are now, &c."<p>The "good degree" they are now purchasing by earnest, patient work may refer to advancement to the higher ministries of the Church, but, more probably, has reference to their future position in the blessed life to come. This is one of the passages not unfrequent in St. Paul's Epistles, where degrees of glory among the redeemed are clearly spoken of. The plain words of St. Paul and his Master teach the people of God that although the great act of redemption alone belongs to Christ, that through His merits only men obtain salvation, still His own, will in a great measure determine, by their works and days on earth, the position they will occupy in His kingdom.<p><span class= "bld">And great boldness.</span>--The true and faithful deacons not only will in the life to come win the great reward, but <span class= "ital">here</span> the result of their loyal, earnest service would be, that before <span class= "ital">men</span> they would do their work with serene, fearless confidence, and would at the same time be encouraged to approach that <span class= "ital">heavenly Father</span> at all times with the loving trustfulness of children.<p><span class= "bld">In the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</span>--Faith was the foundation of the "great boldness," and <span class= "ital">the faith</span> rested on Jesus Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="accented">Served well as deacons</span> for <span class="accented">used the office of a deacon well</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">gain to themselves a good standing</span> for <span class="accented">purchase to themselves a good degree</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Served... as deacons</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); as in ver. 10. In this technical sense only found in these two passages; which well agrees with the late date of this Epistle, when the technical sense of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> was established. <span class="cmt_word">Gain to themselves a good standing.</span> The sense of the passage depends a good deal upon the exact meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-4.htm">1 Samuel 5:4, 5</a>, in the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is the rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span> (rendered <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-3.htm">Ezekiel 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-4.htm">Ezekiel 10:4</a>), a somewhat unusual word for a "threshold." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-9.htm">2 Kings 20:9, 10, 11</a>, it is the rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "a degree on the sun-dial." This latter seems to suit better the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, they gain or acquire, which suggests the idea of <span class="accented">advancement</span>. It does not follow that St. Paul had in his mind their advancement from the "<span class="accented">inferior</span> office" to "<span class="accented">the</span> higher ministries in the Church" (Ordination Service); he may merely have meant to say that the discharge of the duties of a deacon in an efficient and exemplary manner raised a man to high estimation in the Church, and so gave him confidence in confessing the faith of Jesus Christ both by word and deed. <span class="accented">Gain to themselves</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); acquire by purchase or otherwise. Frequent in the LXX.; but only elsewhere in the New Testament in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Boldness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); very common in the New Testament (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13, 29, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-20.htm">Philippians 1:20</a>, etc.), where it is especially applied to boldness in preaching the gospel of Christ. This seems to imply that St. Paul contemplated <span class="accented">preaching</span> as a part of the deacon's work. We know that Philip the deacon and Stephen the deacon were both preachers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:8-13 The deacons were at first appointed to distribute the charity of the church, and to manage its concerns, yet pastors and evangelists were among them. The deacons had a great trust reposed in them. They must be grave, serious, prudent men. It is not fit that public trusts should be lodged in the hands of any, till they are found fit for the business with which they are to be trusted. All who are related to ministers, must take great care to walk as becomes the gospel of Christ.</body></html>
