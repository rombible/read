Yes, confessedly great--so great that the massive grandeur of the pillar is only in proportion to the truth it supports.<p><span class= "bld">God was manifest in the flesh.</span>--Here, in the most ancient authorities, the word "God" does not occur. We must, then, literally translate the Greek of the most famous and trustworthy MSS. as follows: <span class= "ital">He who was manifested in the flesh.</span> In the later MSS., and in the great majority of the fathers who cite the passage, we certainly find <span class= "ital">Theos</span> ("God"), as in the Received text. The substitution can be traced to no special doctrinal prejudice, but is owing, probably, to a well-meant correction of early scribes. At first sight, <span class= "ital">Theos</span> ("God") would be a reading easier to understand, and grammatically more exact; and in the original copies, the great similitude between <span class= "greekheb">?C</span> ("God")--the contracted form in which <span class= "greekheb">?EOC</span> was written--and the relative <span class= "greekheb">?C</span> ("He who"), would be likely to suggest to an officious scribe the very trifling alteration necessary for the easier and apparently more accurate word. Recent investigations have shown, however, beyond controversy that the oldest MSS., with scarcely an exception, contain the more difficult reading, <span class= "greekheb">?C</span> ("He who"). The Greek pronoun thus rendered is simply a relative to an omitted but easily-inferred antecedent--viz., <span class= "ital">Christ.</span> Possibly the difficulty in the construction is due to the fact of the whole verse being a fragment of an ancient Christian hymn, embodying a confession of faith, well known to, and perhaps often sung by, the faithful among the congregations of such cities as Ephesus, Corinth, and Rome--a confession embodying the grand facts of the Incarnation and the Resurrection, the preaching of the cross to, and its reception by, the Gentile world, and the present session of Christ in glory. In the original Greek the rhythmical, as well as the antithetical character, of the clauses is very striking. In the English translation they can hardly be reproduced:--<p>"Who was manifested in the flesh,<p>justified in the Spirit,<p>seen of angels,<p>was preached among the Gentiles,<p>believed on in the world,<p>taken up into glory."<p>Fragments of similar hymns to Christ are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-11.htm" title="It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:">2Timothy 2:11</a>, and perhaps also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-14.htm" title="Why he said, Awake you that sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light.">Ephesians 5:14</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Manifest in the flesh.</span>--When the Son of God came forth from the Father "He was manifested in the flesh;" or, in other divine words, "the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>. Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-10.htm" title="But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death, and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:">2Timothy 1:10</a>). The men and women of the first days of Christianity who repeated or sang such words as these, must have accepted and firmly believed the dogma of the pre-existent glory of Christ.<p><span class= "bld">Justified in the Spirit.</span>--The truth of Jesus Christ's own assertion respecting Himself, which <span class= "ital">seemed</span> to be contradicted by His mortal liability to bodily weakness, and pain and suffering, and last of all to death, in the end was triumphantly vindicated or justified. Or, in other words, the claims of Jesus Christ to Divinity, put forth during His life of humiliation, were shown to be true. It was by His resurrection from the dead that Christ's lofty claims to the Godhead were justified. The Spirit, to which reference is here made, was the higher principle of spiritual life within Him--not itself the Divinity, but intimately united and associated with it. In the power of this Spirit, which he had within himself, He did take His life which He had laid down, did re-unite His soul unto His body from which He separated it when He gave up the ghost, and so did quicken and revive Himself, and thus publicly proclaimed His divine nature, His awful dignity. (Comp. Pearson, <span class= "ital">On the Creed, </span>Art. V.)<p><span class= "bld">Seen of angels . . .</span>--It has been suggested that "angels" mean here nothing more than His Apostles and His own chosen messengers, by whom Jesus Christ was <span class= "ital">seen</span> after His claims to Supreme power had been justified in the Spirit which had raised Him from the dead. These saw Him first, and after that carried the glad message to the distant isles of the Gentiles. But in spite of the ingenuity of such an exposition, the plain, obvious meaning of the word "angels "must be maintained, for the invariable meaning of <span class= "ital">angelos</span> in the New Testament (perhaps with the exception of the earlier chapters of the Apocalypse) is never "apostle," but "angel." He was "seen of angels"--that is, Jesus Christ, after His resurrection and return to the throne at the Father's right hand, was, in His glorified humanity, visible to angels, who before had never looked on God. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-6.htm" title="And again, when he brings in the first-begotten into the world, he said, And let all the angels of God worship him.">Hebrews 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1Peter 1:12</a>--each of which passages bears in some way on this mysterious subject.) Theodoret and St. Chrysostom have similarly commented on this statement respecting the angels' share in the beatific vision.<p><span class= "bld">Preached unto the Gentiles.</span>--The angels now for the first time saw, and gazed on, and rejoiced in, the vision of the Godhead manifested in the glorified humanity of the Son; and what the angels gained in the beatific vision, the nations of the world obtained through the preaching of the gospel--viz., the knowledge of the endless love and the surpassing glory of Christ. This line of the ancient Christian hymn tells us that this early confession of faith was peculiarly the outcome of the Pauline churches; for in enumerating the six glories of the Redeemer God it tells us one of these glories consisted in the preaching of His gospel to those peoples who had hitherto sat in darkness and in the shadow of death. It was the splendid fulfilment of the Isaiah prophecy respecting the coming Messiah. "It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-6.htm" title="And he said, It is a light thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give you for a light to the Gentiles, that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.">Isaiah 49:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Believed on in the world.</span>--Different from Buddhism or even from Mahommedanism, Christianity has found acceptance among widely different nationalities. The religion of the Crucified alone among religions has a fair claim to the title of a world-religion. Its cradle was in the East, but it rapidly found a ready acceptance in the West, and in the present day it may be said not only to exist, but to exercise a vast and ever increasing influence in all the four quarters of the globe.<p><span class= "bld">Received up into glory.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">received up in glory.</span> These words refer evidently to the historical ascent of Christ into heaven--they declare the belief of these early churches in the fact of the Ascension as related in St. Luke's Gospel.<p>This fragment of the triumph-song of the early churches embraces the leading facts of the Messianic story:--<p>(1) The Incarnation of the Son of God.<p>(2) The justification in His Resurrection of the lofty claims advanced by Him during the days of His humiliation.<p>(3) The Epiphany of the glorified Humanity of Christ.<p>(<span class= "ital">a</span>) To angels in the beatific vision.<p>(<span class= "ital">b</span>) To men in the preaching of the cross.<p>(4) The glorious results of the great sacrifice already visible in those first suffering, struggling days of the Church.<p>(5) The return to heaven, and the session in power at the right hand of God--<span class= "ital">closing</span> the first part of the blessed resurrection mystery, and <span class= "ital">beginning</span> the glorious reign of Christ over men from His throne in heaven.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="accented">He who</span> for <span class="accented">God</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">manifested</span> for <span class="accented">manifest</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">among the nations</span> for <span class="accented">unto the Gentiles</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">in</span> for <span class="accented">into</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Without controversy</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>); only here in the New Testament, but used in the same sense in the LXX. and in classical Greek, "confessedly," by common confession. <span class="cmt_word">Great is the mystery of godliness.</span> This is said to enhance the glory of the Church just spoken of, to whom this <span class="accented">mystery</span> has been entrusted, and so still further to impress upon Timothy the vital necessity of a wise and holy walk in the Church. <span class="accented">The mystery of godliness</span> is all that truth which "in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit." <span class="cmt_word">Godliness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e."</span> the Christian faith;" what in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3</a> is called "The words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the doctrine which is according to godliness (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f76;&#x1fb3;</span>)," and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-1.htm">2 Timothy 1:1</a>, "The truth which is according to godliness."

The antecedent, therefore, must be understood, and gathered from the preceding words, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. It can only be Christ. The mystery of the whole Old Testament, that which was wrapped in types and hidden under veils, was Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>). Moses spake of him, the Psalms speak of him, the prophets speak of him; but all of them spake darkly. But in the gospel "the mystery of Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>)is revealed. Christ is the Mystery of Christianity. It is, therefore, no difficult step to pass from "the mystery" to "Christ," and to supply the word "Christ" as the antecedent to "who." <span class="cmt_word">Was manifested</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>); a word frequently applied to Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-31.htm">John 1:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-2.htm">1 John 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-5.htm">1 John 3:5, 8</a>, etc.). The idea is the same in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Justified in the spirit.</span> This is rather an obscure expression. But it seems to describe our Lord's spotless righteousness, perhaps with special reference to the declaration of it at his baptism, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." We have the same contrast between the flesh and the Spirit of Christ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>. And between the flesh and the spirit of a Christian man in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>, "The body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness." To this clause apparently the remark of Chrysostom applies, "God became man, and man became God." "The spirit" seems to mean the moral nature - the inner man. <span class="cmt_word">Seen of angels.</span> Perhaps the multitude of the heavenly host who welcomed the birth of Christ were permitted to see the new-born Babe, as he seems to have done who described him to the shepherds as "wrapped in swaddling clothes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-12.htm">Luke 2:12-14</a>). Angels ministered unto him after the temptation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-13.htm">Mark 1:13</a>), and in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-43.htm">Luke 22:43</a>, where the word <span class="greek">&#x1f64;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> is used), and at his resurrection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2</a>). The special interest of angels in the "<span class="accented">great mystery"</span> is referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Preached among the nations</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). It would have been better to keep the rendering "Gentiles" here, to mark the identity of thought with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6, 8</a>, where, in the apostle's view, the preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles, that they might be fellow-heirs with the Jews of the promises of God, is one main feature of the mystery (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-7.htm">1 Timothy 2:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Believed on in the world.</span> The next step in this ascending scale is the acceptance of Christ in the world as the Savior thereof. The language here is not stronger than that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5, 6</a>, "The word of the truth of the gospel, which is come unto you; even as it is also in all the world, and beareth fruit." And in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>, "The gospel which was preached in all creation under heaven" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>). The statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15-20</a> might almost have been in St. Paul's mind. Note the use there of the words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Received up in glory.</span> The change of "into" (A.V.) into "in" is of very doubtful propriety. In New Testament Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, frequently follows verbs of motion, and means the same as <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, like the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>. Our Lord is net said to have ascended <span class="accented">in glory</span> (as he appeared at the Transfiguration), but, as St. Mark has it, "He was received up into heaven, and [there] sat down at the right hand of God," fulfilling <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>. This grand burst of dogmatic teaching is somewhat like that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5-7</a>. There is no adequate evidence of its being, as many commentators have thought, a portion of a hymn or creed used in the Church. It rather implies the same tension in the apostle's mind which is apparent in other parts of the Epistle (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-11.htm">1 Timothy 6:11</a> and following verses). <p> <p> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:14-16 The church is the house of God; he dwells there. The church holds forth the Scripture and the doctrine of Christ, as a pillar holds forth a proclamation. When a church ceases to be the pillar and ground of truth, we may and ought to forsake her; for our regard to truth should be first and greatest. The mystery of godliness is Christ. He is God, who was made flesh, and was manifest in the flesh. God was pleased to manifest himself to man, by his own Son taking the nature of man. Though reproached as a sinner, and put to death as a malefactor, Christ was raised again by the Spirit, and so was justified from all the false charges with which he was loaded. Angels ministered to him, for he is the Lord of angels. The Gentiles welcomed the gospel which the Jews rejected. Let us remember that God was manifest in the flesh, to take away our sins, to redeem us from all iniquity, and to purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. These doctrines must be shown forth by the fruits of the Spirit in our lives.</body></html>
