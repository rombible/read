The "faithful saying" here refers to the wish for high and arduous work in the Church of Christ, and declares such a wish to be a noble one; for the office in question was a beautiful one, and honourable, and in those days meant stern and ceaseless work, grave and constant danger. It was no doubt one of the well-known sayings among the brethren of the first days, and not improbably, with the other "faithful sayings" of this group of Epistles, formed a part of their liturgy, and was woven into some of their special prayers offered in public. Perhaps this "faithful saying" was a portion of a prayer offered not unfrequently in the public assembly, asking that volunteers might be moved by the Holy Ghost to present themselves for the then dangerous office of ordained ministers of the Word.<p>"Well might a man desire the office of chief pastor; it was indeed a good work;" but, in the first place, such a dignity could only be held by one possessing many qualities, then and there enumerated.<p><span class= "bld">If a man desire the office of a bishop.</span>--More accurately rendered, <span class= "ital">If a man seeketh.</span> In the . . Pastoral Epistles the Greek words rendered "bishop" and "presbyter" or elder (<span class= "ital">episcopos, presbuteros</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>are applied indifferently to the same person, for up to this period (A.D. 65-6) no necessity had arisen in the constitution of the Church for the appointment of a <span class= "ital">special order</span> of superintending presbyters. The numbers of the members of the brotherhood, though every year showing a vast increase, were still, comparatively speaking, small. St. Peter, St. Paul, St. James and St. John, and certainly the majority of the apostolic college, were still living; while, till A.D. 70, the Jerusalem congregation still acted as the central authority of the Church, and grave questions continued to be referred to the Fathers resident there.<p>Early in the second century, however, there is not a shadow of doubt that the episcopal office, as we understand it, was widely established. During the last thirty years, then, of the first century, this great change in Church organisation must have been effected--that is, <span class= "ital">during the life-time of St. John.</span> How this was brought about is admirably stated by Professor Rothe, of Heidelberg, as quoted by Canon Lightfoot in his dissertation on the Christian ministry (<span class= "ital">Commentary</span> <span class= "ital">on the Epistle to the Philippians</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>who, without accepting all the details suggested, still in the main agrees with the famous Heidelberg professor in his theory respecting the very early establishment of episcopacy in the Catholic Church. After painting the distractions and growing dissensions of the Church, occasioned by the jealousies between the Jewish and Gentile brethren, and the menacing apparition of the Gnostic heresy, Rothe states how, in the face of this great emergency, St. Peter, St. Paul, and St. James were carried away by death almost at the same time; while, with the overthrow of Jerusalem very shortly after, the visible centre of the Church was removed, the keystone of the fabric was withdrawn, and the whole edifice was threatened with ruin. There was a crying need for some organisation which should cement together the diverse elements of Christian society, and preserve it from disintegration. Out of this need the Catholic Church in its episcopal character arose. From notices in Eusebius, Irenaeus, and Clement of Rome, Rothe (quoted by Lightfoot) concludes "that, immediately after the fall of Jerusalem, a council of the surviving Apostles and first teachers of the gospel was held to deliberate on the crisis, and to frame measures for the well-being of the Church. The centre of the system thus organised was episcopacy, which at once secured the compact and harmonious working of each individual congregation, and, as the link of communication between the separate brotherhoods, formed the whole into one undivided Catholic Church. Recommended by this high authority, the new constitution was immediately and generally adopted."<p><span class= "bld">He desireth a good work.</span>--The office of a presbyter of the Church in the days of St. Paul was a difficult and dangerous post. It involved much labour; it was full of risk; it meant a hard and severe life; yet, from the Christian's standpoint, it was a work, if faithfully performed, of all toils the most beautiful, the most honourable, the most noble.

But <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "bishop" (ver. 2) - except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-25.htm">1 Peter 2:25</a>, where it is applied to Christ - always means the overseer of the particular flock, - the presbyter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-7.htm">Titus 1:7</a>); <span class="accented">and</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> the functions of such <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2</a> compared with 1). It was not till the sub-apostolic age that the name of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x1fbf;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> was confined to the chief overseer who had "<span class="accented">priests</span> and deacons" under him, as Timothy and Titus had. Possibly this application of the word arose from the visits of the apostles, and afterwards of men sent by the apostles, as Timothy and Titus, Tychicus and <span class="accented">Artemas</span>, were, to visit the Churches, being occasional and temporary only, as those of Visitors. For such occasional visitation is implied in the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-36.htm">Matthew 25:36, 43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-68.htm">Luke 1:68, 78</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-23.htm">Acts 7:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-36.htm">Acts 15:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>). Afterwards, when the wants of the Churches required permanent oversight, the name <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> - <span class="accented">vescovo</span> (It.), <span class="accented">eueque</span> (Fr.), <span class="accented">bischof</span> (Get.), <span class="accented">bisceop</span> (A.S.), <span class="accented">aipiskaupus</span> (Moeso-Goth.), etc. - became universal for the chief overseer of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">A good work</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, as ver. 10). <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;</span> means "honourable," "becoming," "beneficial," and the like. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 If a man desired the pastoral office, and from love to Christ, and the souls of men, was ready to deny himself, and undergo hardships by devoting himself to that service, he sought to be employed in a good work, and his desire should be approved, provided he was qualified for the office. A minister must give as little occasion for blame as can be, lest he bring reproach upon his office. He must be sober, temperate, moderate in all his actions, and in the use of all creature-comforts. Sobriety and watchfulness are put together in Scripture, they assist one the other. The families of ministers ought to be examples of good to all other families. We should take heed of pride; it is a sin that turned angels into devils. He must be of good repute among his neighbours, and under no reproach from his former life. To encourage all faithful ministers, we have Christ's gracious word of promise, Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world, Mt 28:20. And he will fit his ministers for their work, and carry them through difficulties with comfort, and reward their faithfulness.</body></html>
