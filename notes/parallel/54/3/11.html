The question naturally occurs--why are <span class= "ital">deacon's</span> wives especially referred to, while nothing has been said respecting the wives of presbyters? Then, again, why should the choice of Timothy in the matter of his selection of a deacon be hampered with any special requirements in the wife of the candidate for the holy office? The literal translation of the Greek words would be, <span class= "ital">Women in like manner must, </span>&c. These <span class= "ital">women, </span>St. Chrysostom and most of the ancient expositors affirm, were <span class= "ital">deaconesses.</span><p>It is certain that there were women holding a kind of official position as deaconesses in the early Church; nor is it probable that these deaconesses were, as a class, confined to the restriction of age referred to in the direction respecting a band of widows devoted to works of mercy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/5-9.htm" title="Let not a widow be taken into the number under three score years old, having been the wife of one man.">1Timothy 5:9-10</a>). These widows seemed to have been in the first instance a class or order apart from the ordinary deaconesses.<p>Phebe of Cenchrea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-1.htm" title="I commend to you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:">Romans 16:1</a>), Euodias, and Syntyche (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-2.htm" title="I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.">Philippians 4:2</a>), probably the organisation alluded to (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/9-36.htm" title="Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and giving of alms which she did.">Acts 9:36-41</a>) as existing at Joppa, of which Dorcas was the chief, may be cited as instances from the New Testament of the employment of these women-servants of the Church. In the next century the Proconsul Pliny, in his famous letter to the Emperor Trajan, distinctly alludes to these Christian deaconesses, in the words, "<span class= "ital">ancillae quae ministrae dicebantur.</span>" "In the Western Church," says Professor Reynolds, "the order did not cease to exist until the fifth century, and was continued in the Greek Church till the twelfth. The deaconess vanished into the cloister until partially revived in comparatively modern times."<p><span class= "bld">Be grave.</span>--The same word is used as in the case of the deacons. These deaconesses, too, must, with their modest behaviour, with their sweet, decorous gravity, as it has been well said, "inspire reverence having the halo of purity and sanctity about them."<p><span class= "bld">Not slanderers.</span>--A woman's most ready weapon is ever her tongue. She is, with all her noble, generous qualities, often quick-tempered, passionate, impulsive, jealous, and this weapon, always ready for attack or defence, is too often unsheathed. The professed servant of the Lord must show a high example to her sisters in self-control.<p><span class= "bld">Sober.</span>--Should be <span class= "ital">abstemious, </span>even self-denying in the pleasures of the table.<p><span class= "bld">Faithful in all things.</span>--These deaconesses, from their position, would become the depositaries of many a household secret; to those confiding in them in moments of trouble they must be true; scrupulously honest also in their distribution of alms; faithful, too, in the holy instruction they would be often called on to give in the course of their ministrations.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="accented">Women in like maturer must</span> for <span class="accented">even so must their wives</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">temperate</span> for <span class="accented">sober</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Women</span>. What is meant by these "women"? Certainly not women in general, which would be quite out of harmony with the context. The choice lies between <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the wives of the deacons, as in the A.V.; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the wives of the episcopi and deacons; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> deaconesses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This last, on the whole, is the most probable. The male deacons had just been spoken of, and so the apostle goes on to speak of the female deacons (at <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1</a>). He conceives of the deacon's office as consisting of two branches - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the deacons, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the deaconesses; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>and gives appropriate directions for each. It must he remembered that the office of the early deacon was in a great measure secular, so that there is nothing strange in that of the deaconess being coupled with it. The retrain in ver. 12 to the male deacon is in favor of understanding "the women" of the deaconesses, as showing that the subject of the diaconate was not done with. Chrysostom (who says, "He is speaking of those who hold the rank of deaconesses") and all the ancient commentators, and De Wette, Wiesinger, Wordsworth, Alford, and Ellicott among the moderns, so understand it (see following notes). <span class="cmt_word">Grave</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span>; see ver. 8, note). <span class="cmt_word">Not slanderers</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, corresponding to the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> of ver. 8). This use of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, which is the classical one, is peculiar in the New Testament to the pastoral Epistles (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-3.htm">2 Timothy 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-3.htm">Titus 2:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Temperate</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>; see ver. 2, note). It corresponds here to the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> of ver. 8. <span class="cmt_word">Faithful in all things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). This seems to refer specially to their being the almoners of the Church charities, and so favors the explanation of "women" as meaning deaconesses. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> means especially "trusty" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-45.htm">Matthew 24:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-42.htm">Luke 12:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:8-13 The deacons were at first appointed to distribute the charity of the church, and to manage its concerns, yet pastors and evangelists were among them. The deacons had a great trust reposed in them. They must be grave, serious, prudent men. It is not fit that public trusts should be lodged in the hands of any, till they are found fit for the business with which they are to be trusted. All who are related to ministers, must take great care to walk as becomes the gospel of Christ.</body></html>
