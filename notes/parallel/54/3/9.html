He had been dwelling with great earnestness on the <span class= "ital">outward</span> characteristics which a deacon of the Church should possess--the high and stainless name--the generous respect which his old way of living had won for him among unbelievers as well as with believers; but, in addition to these things, it was absolutely necessary for one occupying such a post to know something of the deeper spiritual life--<span class= "ital">he must hold the mystery of the faith.</span> Now what does St. Paul mean by the mystery? He speaks of it as "a treasure" which must be held in the casket of a pure conscience. This mystery was what was sometimes hidden, but which was now revealed by the advent of St. Paul's Master, and comprehended the truths of the redemption, the atonement, and mighty cleansing powers of the precious blood of Christ. These--the master truths of Christianity--must the appointed teacher firmly grasp; and the true deacon, whose office it was rather <span class= "ital">to administer</span> than <span class= "ital">to preach</span> to the people, must also be especially careful to show that he lived the life he professed to teach; or, in St. Paul's own simile, must preserve the casket in which the precious mystery was shrined, holy and undefiled before men--<span class= "ital">he must hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, a mystery, is that which, having been long hidden, is at length disclosed, either to men generally or to elect disciples. It is derived from <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, to initiate, of which the passive <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, to be instructed or initiated, is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-12.htm">Philippians 4:12</a>, and is common in classical Greek, being itself derived from <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>, "to close the lips as in pronouncing the syllable <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1fe6;</span>," whence also <span class="accented">taurus</span>. The idea is of something <span class="accented">secret</span>, which might not be spoken cf. In the New Testament we have "the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-10.htm">Luke 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-11.htm">Mark 4:11</a>); and St. Paul brings out the full force of the word when he speaks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a>) of "the mystery which was <span class="accented">kept secret</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) since the world began... but is now made known to all nations for the obedience of faith" (see too <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2.htm">Colossians 2</a>:26, etc.). "The faith" is equivalent to "the gospel," or "the kingdom of heaven," or the "godliness" of ver. 16 (where see note); and "the mystery of the faith" might be paraphrased by "the revealed truth of Christianity". What is added, "in a pure conscience," teaches us that orthodoxy without personal holiness is little worth. Holding "the truth in unrighteousness" is severely condemned by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>). He says of himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-1.htm">Acts 23:1</a>), "I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-16.htm">Acts 24:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-5.htm">1 Timothy 1:5, 19</a>, etc.). It is much to be observed how St. Paul, the great teacher of the doctrine of g-race, lays constant stress upon the functions of the conscience, and the necessity of having a pure conscience. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:8-13 The deacons were at first appointed to distribute the charity of the church, and to manage its concerns, yet pastors and evangelists were among them. The deacons had a great trust reposed in them. They must be grave, serious, prudent men. It is not fit that public trusts should be lodged in the hands of any, till they are found fit for the business with which they are to be trusted. All who are related to ministers, must take great care to walk as becomes the gospel of Christ.</body></html>
