The order clearly sprang out of the needs of the rapidly increasing church. Some two years after the Ascension (A.D. 34-35) the seven deacons were appointed to assist the Apostles as almoners of the brethren; as the Church's life developed, the functions of these primitive subordinate ecclesiastical officers were enlarged. The history of the career of Stephen and Philip supply ample evidence of this. Out of his first apostolic appointment in the year 34-35, no doubt, was developed that great inferior order in the Church, respecting which these definite rules and authoritative regulations were laid down by the Apostle Paul in his instructions to Timothy in the matter of church government and order. These primitive deacons were evidently assistants to and probably in many cases supplied the place of the presbyters. The great similarity of the directions of St. Paul respecting the qualifications to be looked for in both, implies this; still their original employment as administrators of the Church's funds and distribution of her alms remained to them. We can trace the existence of the order through and beyond the Apostle's time:--<p>Jerusalem<p>. . .<p>A.D.<p>34-35.<p>Original foundation of order by the Apostles at Jerusalem. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/4-1.htm" title="And as they spoke to the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came on them,">Acts 4:1-6</a>.<p>Corinth<p>. . .<p>A.D.<p>55.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-28.htm" title="And God has set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.">1Corinthians 12:28</a>.<p>Rome<p>. . .<p>A.D.<p>58-9.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-7.htm" title="Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teaches, on teaching;">Romans 12:7</a>.<p>Philippi<p>. . .<p>A.D.<p>63.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm" title="Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:">Philippians 1:1</a>.<p>Ephesus<p>. . .<p>A.D.<p>66.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-8.htm" title="Likewise must the deacons be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;">1Timothy 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-13.htm" title="For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.">1Timothy 3:13</a>.<p>Asia Minor<p>. . .<p>A.D.<p>63-69<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-11.htm" title="If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God gives: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever.

Amen.">1Peter 4:11</a>).<p>Thus in the first half of the second century we find the order regularly and apparently universally established, constituting an acknowledged part of the Christian system of ecclesiastical government. The scattered notices of the diaconate in the New Testament, dating almost from the Ascension--over a period exceeding thirty years--show us how, out of the needs of the Church, arose this subordinate order, which was rapidly developed as the Catholic Church increased. The differences between the deacon of the Pastoral Epistles, and the deacon of the writings of Justin Martyr, are exactly what we should expect would result from the seventy years of gradual but progressive organisation under men like St. John and his disciples and the immediate successors of the Apostles.<p><span class= "bld">Be grave.</span>--St. Paul again repeats the need for this feature of character being found in the lower order of ecclesiastical officers. The reverent decorum, the quiet gravity, which never interferes with the innocent, childlike happiness (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-4.htm" title="One that rules well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;">1Timothy 3:4</a>), is especially to be looked for in a deacon, who ought to show an example of every-day Christian life.<p><span class= "bld">Not doubletongued.</span>--Bengel well paraphrases it, <span class= "ital">ad alios alia loquentes.</span> The deacon would have in his duties connected with the administration of the Church's alms, and also in his more directly spiritual work, much opportunity of meeting with and talking to the various families of the flock of his Master. He must be watchful, in these visits, of his words, not suiting them to the occasion, and then unsaying in one house what he had affirmed in another. Such a grave fault--not an uncommon one--would, in the long run, deeply injure his influence abroad, and would inflict a deadly wound on his own spiritual life.<p><span class= "bld">Not given to much wine.</span>--The professed minister--the advocate for the cause of the poor and needy--must show an example of the strictest sobriety, must be pointed at as one caring little for the pleasures of the table. How well and nobly the young lieutenant of St. Paul aimed at showing in himself a self-denying example to the flock, we see from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-23.htm" title="Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your often infirmities.">1Timothy 5:23</a>, when the old master deemed it requisite to warn his earnest, brave disciple from an asceticism which was positively weakening his power of work and endurance.<p><span class= "bld">Not greedy of filthy lucre.</span>--Those entrusted with the care of the Church's alms surely must be especially careful of their reputation in the matter of covetousness--among the "chosen" of Timothy there must be no Judas.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="accented">Deacons in like manner must</span> for <span class="accented">likewise must the deacons</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Grave</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>); in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a> rendered "honest" in the A.V., and "honourable" in the R.V., and "venerable" in the margin. None of the words are satisfactory, but "honest" in the sense of <span class="accented">honnete</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "respectable," "becoming the dignity of a man," comes nearest to the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is a man who inspires respect by his conduct and deportment. It occurs again in ver. 11 and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-2.htm">Titus 2:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Double-tongued</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>); only here in the New Testament, or indeed anywhere. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> and the noun <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> are found in Xenophon and Diodorus Siculus, but in a different sense - "to repeat," "repetition." Here <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-13.htm">Proverbs 11:13</a>; Ecclus. 28:13), "a slanderer," "a false-tongued man," who, as Theophylact (ap. Schleusner) well explains it, thinks one thing and says another, and says different things to different people. The caution here given is of incalculable importance to young curates. They must not allow themselves to be either receptacles or vehicles of scandal and detraction. Their speech to rich and poor alike must be perfectly sincere and ingenuous. <span class="cmt_word">Not given to much wine.</span> The effect of the best sermon may be undone, and more than undone, if the preacher sinks into the pot-companion of his hearers. He at once ceases to be <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">to</span> inspire respect (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-3.htm">Titus 2:3</a> where the additional idea, most true, of the <span class="accented">slavery</span> of drunkards, is introduced). <span class="cmt_word">Greedy of filthy lucre</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>); only here and in ver. 3 (T.R.) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-7.htm">Titus 1:7</a>. The adverb <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2</a>, and is one of many points of resemblance between the pastoral Epistles and 1 Peter. Balsam, Gehazi, and Judas Iscariot are the three prominent examples of professed servants of God being lovers of filthy lucre. Achan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-21.htm">Joshua 7:21</a>) is another (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>). When lucre is the price for doing wrong, it is "filthy." When lucre is sought on occasions where none is due, it is "filthy;" and when the desire of even just gains is excessive, it ceases to be clean. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:8-13 The deacons were at first appointed to distribute the charity of the church, and to manage its concerns, yet pastors and evangelists were among them. The deacons had a great trust reposed in them. They must be grave, serious, prudent men. It is not fit that public trusts should be lodged in the hands of any, till they are found fit for the business with which they are to be trusted. All who are related to ministers, must take great care to walk as becomes the gospel of Christ.</body></html>
