The word "novice" here refers rather to want of experience and standing in the Christian brotherhood than to "youth." Timothy himself, to whom St. Paul was writing, and whom the Apostle had placed over this church, was at the time, comparatively speaking, still a man young in years, although old in trials and in Christian experiences.<p><span class= "bld">Lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.</span>--The Greek word rendered here "being lifted up," would be more happily Englished by <span class= "ital">being clouded</span> or <span class= "ital">deluded.</span> It marks the pride or vanity engendered by the finding himself in a position of authority for which no previous training and experience had fitted him. Such a "novice" would be in imminent danger of falling into the judgment passed by God upon the devil, whose fall was owing to the same blinding effect of pride.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> <span class="accented">Puffed up</span> for <span class="accented">lifted up with pride</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">A novice</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); only here in the New Testament, but found repeatedly in the LXX. in its literal sense of "a tree" or "plantation" newly planted (Psalm 127:3 (Psalms 128:3, A.V.); 144:12; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-7.htm">Isaiah 5:7</a>). Here the <span class="accented">novice</span> or <span class="accented">neophyte</span> is one recently converted and received into the Church (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>). As such he is not yet fit to be a ruler and a teacher of the brethren. The reason follows. <span class="cmt_word">Lest being puffed up he fall into the condemnation of the devil</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, puffed up, is peculiar in the New Testament to the pastoral Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-4.htm">1 Timothy 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-4.htm">2 Timothy 3:4</a>), from <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, smoke (comp. <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "smoking flax," <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-10.htm">Matthew 12:10</a>). The idea seems to be "lightness," "emptiness," and "elation." Some add that of "obscuration" as by smoke; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>, to wrap in smoke; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, to be wrapt in clouds of conceit and folly (Liddell and Scott). <span class="accented">The condemnation of the devil</span>. A somewhat obscure phrase. It means either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the same condemnation as that into which the devil fell through pride, - and so Chrysostom, Olshausen, Bishop Ellicott, Wordsworth, Alford, etc., take it; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the condemnation or accusation of the devil. In the latter case <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> would be used in the same sense as <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a>, and would mean the charge preferred against him by "the accuser of the brethren" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-9.htm">Job 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-4.htm">Job 2:4, 5</a>). One of the senses of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> is "to accuse" - like <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="accented">Liddell</span> and Scott). And this view agrees with <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in ver. 7, which means, not the trap into which the devil fell, but the trap laid by the devil.

A minister must give as little occasion for blame as can be, lest he bring reproach upon his office. He must be sober, temperate, moderate in all his actions, and in the use of all creature-comforts. Sobriety and watchfulness are put together in Scripture, they assist one the other. The families of ministers ought to be examples of good to all other families. We should take heed of pride; it is a sin that turned angels into devils. He must be of good repute among his neighbours, and under no reproach from his former life. To encourage all faithful ministers, we have Christ's gracious word of promise, Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world, Mt 28:20. And he will fit his ministers for their work, and carry them through difficulties with comfort, and reward their faithfulness.</body></html>
