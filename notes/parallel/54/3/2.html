The second chapter had treated of the duties of <span class= "ital">congregations collectively</span> in the matter of public prayer; the third chapter speaks of the special character and qualities necessary for the <span class= "ital">rulers</span> of these congregations. These "elders" must, in the first place, be men whose character is unimpeachable--men who stand high in public estimation, known for their pure life and spotless integrity. Not only must believers reverence the character of the superintending and ruling elders of their community, but even those outside the brotherhood of Christ must respect the life and conversation of these prominent and conspicuous members of a society which, from the nature of things, would be sure to provoke distrust and jealousy.<p><span class= "bld">The husband of</span> <span class= "bld">one wife.</span>--The general opinion of the most ancient writers--the decisions of Church councils when the question seems to have been placed before them--the custom of the great Greek Church, which, while permitting a single nuptial, still regarded the repetition of the marriage relation as a disqualification for the higher grade of the episcopate--tell us in general terms that the opinion of the Church from the earliest times interprets this saying of St. Paul as a declaration against second marriages in the case of those seeking the office of presbyter or deacon. The Greek Church evidently accepts this interpretation, though it relaxes the rule in the case of the inferior orders.<p>There seems, however, good reason for doubting the accuracy of this popular interpretation, which appears, by thus casting a reproach upon second marriages, to urge a spirit of asceticism on all Christian society, very foreign to St. Paul's usual teaching, which was content with gently inculcating a higher and a purer life as alone in accordance with the mind of his pitiful and loving Master. It was only by slow degrees that he hoped to raise the tone of society and public opinion in this world.<p>Inspired Christian teaching was careful not to distract the everyday life of men and women by insisting on sudden and violent changes. The behaviour of the great Christian teachers in the matter of that terrible and universal practice of slavery should be especially noted.<p>When we ask, What then did St. Paul mean by these words? we must picture to ourselves the state of society in the empire at the time when the Apostle wrote to Timothy. An inundation of Eastern luxury and Eastern morals had submerged all the old Roman habits of austere simplicity. The long civil war and the subsequent license of the empire had degraded the character of the people. The period when St. Paul wrote was especially marked by an extreme depravity. A great and general indisposition towards <span class= "ital">marriage</span> at all, and the orderly restraints of home and family life, had become so marked a feature in Roman society, that we find Augustus positively enacting laws against celibacy. Another cause which helped to undermine the stability of home life and those family ties which ought to be deemed so sacred, was the ease and frequency of divorce, which Seneca, who may be considered almost as the contemporary of St. Paul, alludes to as incidents no longer looked upon as shameful in Rome. He even, in his indignation at the laxity of the morals of his day, cites cases of women who reckoned their years rather by their husbands than by the consuls. Martial writes of a woman who had arrived at her tenth husband. Juvenal speaks of one who, in five years, had had eight husbands. Among the Jews we know <span class= "ital">polygamy</span> was then prevalent. St. Paul, fully conscious of this low and debased moral tone which then pervaded all society in the empire, <span class= "ital">in these few words</span> condemned all illicit relations between the sexes, and directed that in choosing persons to fill holy offices in the congregations of Christians, those should be selected who had married and remained faithful to the wife of their choice, whose life and practice would thus serve as an example to the flock, and to whose homes men might point as the pattern which Jesus loved, while the heathen world around them would see that the hated and despised Christians not only loved and honoured, but <span class= "ital">lived</span> that pure home life their own great moralists pressed so earnestly upon them, but in vain. This direction, which requires that those to be selected to fill holy offices should be known for their purity in their family relations, of course does not exclude--should any such offer themselves--those men who, while contracting no marriage ties, still were known to lead upright, moral lives.<p><span class= "bld">Vigilant.</span>--The Greek word here is more accurately rendered <span class= "ital">sober.</span> The presbyter or elder should be soberminded, self-restrained, temperate (not merely in wine, but in all things).<p><span class= "bld">Sober.</span>--Better rendered, <span class= "ital">discreet.</span><p><span class= "bld">Of good behaviour.--</span>Rather, <span class= "ital">orderly.</span> This word refers to outward conduct, to behaviour in public.<p>The Christian office-bearer must not only be wise and self-restrained in himself, but his outward bearing must in all respects correspond to his inner life.<p><span class= "bld">Given to hospitality.</span>--In the early days of Christianity, when Christians travelling from one place to another, were in the habit, when it was possible, of resorting to the houses of their brethren in the faith, to avoid consorting with idolaters in the public inns. It was of no slight importance that the presiding elders in a congregation should be men who loved to entertain strangers and others, from whom nothing could be expected in return.<p><span class= "bld">Apt to teach.</span>--The elder should possess something more than a willingness, or glad readiness, to teach the less instructed the mysteries of the faith. He ought also to have the far rarer qualification of a power to impart knowledge to others. Zeal is not by any means the only, or even the principal, qualification to be sought for in a minister of the Word.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> for <span class="accented">a</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">therefore</span> for <span class="accented">then</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">without reproach</span> for <span class="accented">blameless</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">temperate</span> for <span class="accented">vigilant</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">sober-minded</span> for <span class="accented">sober</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">orderly</span> for <span class="accented">of good behavior</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The bishop</span> (see note on ver. 1); "a bishop" is better English. <span class="cmt_word">Without reproach</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-7.htm">1 Timothy 5:7</a> and 1 Tim 6:14 in the New Testament; not found anywhere in the LXX, but used by Thucydides, Euripides, and others, in the sense of "not open to attack," "blameless." The metaphor is said (though denied by others)to be from wrestling or boxing, when a man leaves no part of his body exposed to the attack of his adversary. <span class="cmt_word">The husband of one wife</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-6.htm">Titus 1:6</a>). Three senses are possible. The passage may be understood <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as <span class="accented">requiring</span> a bishop, (or presbyter) to have a wife, and so some took it even in Chrysostom's time (though he does not so understand it), and so the Russian Church understands it; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as prohibiting his having more than one with at a time; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> as prohibiting second marriages for priests and bishops. Bishop Wordsworth, Bishop Ellicott, and Dean Alford, among English commentators, all agree in thinking that (3) is the apostle's meaning. In spite of such <span class="accented">consensus</span>, it appears in the highest degree improbable that St. Paul should have laid down such a condition for the priesthood. There is nothing in his writings when treating expressly of second marriages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-2.htm">Romans 7:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-8.htm">1 Corinthians 7:8, 39</a>) to suggest the notion of there being anything disreputable in a second marriage, and it would obviously cast a great slur upon second marriages if it were laid down as a principle that no one who had married twice was fit to be an <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. But if we consider the general laxity in regard to marriage, and the facility of divorce, which prevailed among Jews and Romans at this time, it must have been a common thing for a man to have more than one woman living who had been his wife. And this, as a distinct breach of the primeval law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>), would properly be a bar to any one being called to the "office of a bishop." The same case is supposed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-10.htm">1 Corinthians 7:10-13</a>. But it is utterly unsupported by any single passage in Scripture that a second marriage should disqualify a man for the sacred ministry. As regards the opinion of the early Church, it was not at all uniform, and amongst those who held that this passage absolutely prohibits second marriages in the case of an <span class="accented">episcopus</span>, it was merely a part of the asceticism of the day. As a matter of course, such writers as Origen and Tertullian held it. The very early opinion that Joseph, the husband of Mary, had children by a former wife, which finds place in the Protevangelium of James (9.), is hardly consistent with the theory of the disreputableness of second marriages. In like manner, the phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-9.htm">1 Timothy 5:9</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, is best explained in accordance with the apostle's doctrine about the lawfulness of a woman's second marriage, as meaning that she was the husband of one man only, as long as her husband lived. (For the chief patristic opinions on the subject, see Bishop Wordsworth's note, and Bingham's 'Christian Antiquities,' bk. 4. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5.htm">1 Timothy 5</a>.) Temperate (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); peculiar to the pastoral Epistles (see ver. 11 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-2.htm">Titus 2:2</a>), but found in classical Greek. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> means "to be sober" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-13.htm">1 Peter 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-7.htm">1 Peter 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>). It denotes that temperate use of meat and drink which keeps the mind watchful and on the alert, and then the state of mind itself so produced. The opposite state of mind is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-34.htm">Luke 21:34</a>.

A minister must give as little occasion for blame as can be, lest he bring reproach upon his office. He must be sober, temperate, moderate in all his actions, and in the use of all creature-comforts. Sobriety and watchfulness are put together in Scripture, they assist one the other. The families of ministers ought to be examples of good to all other families. We should take heed of pride; it is a sin that turned angels into devils. He must be of good repute among his neighbours, and under no reproach from his former life. To encourage all faithful ministers, we have Christ's gracious word of promise, Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world, Mt 28:20. And he will fit his ministers for their work, and carry them through difficulties with comfort, and reward their faithfulness.</body></html>
