Those who once knew him among other associations living a very different life, would be only too ready to attack the blameless character of the congregation, through the stained and scarred reputation of their minister. The temptation to fall away and deny his Lord in such a case, would be overwhelming. The man might be in earnest, might be wishful to lead a new and better life, but the risk that one with such connections, with such memories of old days, would of necessity run, must be very great. Weakened and disheartened, such a presbyter would be likely to fall an easy prey into some snare skilfully laid by the Enemy, and, by his fall, cause a terrible and damaging injury to the Church of Christ. For these weighty reasons St. Paul charged Timothy to be very watchful when he chose his presiding elders, to elect only those who, in the dissolute society of Ephesus, had known how, even in old days, to preserve their good name stainless, their character unscarred.<p><span class= "bld">The snare of the devil.</span>--The teaching here of St. Paul respecting the Evil One is deserving of a special comment. What he says in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/3-6.htm" title="Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.">1Timothy 3:6-7</a> is simply introduced as part of the main argument, which relates exclusively to the care to be exercised in the selection of fit persons for the sacred offices in the congregations. It is evidently not introduced as a special teaching on this mysterious subject. No disputings on this point as yet had been originated at this early period in Christian history. It lays down, however, certain broad principles which must have been the ground-work of St. Paul's belief in this now disputed question; and receiving as we do St. Paul's words in this and in his other epistles as an authoritative declaration of the mind and will of the Holy Spirit, it seems that these broad principles should have <span class= "ital">all</span> weight whenever the doctrine respecting the Spirit of Evil is discussed. The lines hero sketched are as follows: (1) The personality of the Evil One is distinctly affirmed. (2; This unhappy being has fallen and has been condemned, and is now able to lay snares for and to tempt men. (3) An overweening pride seems to have been the cause which led to this once mighty one's fall. (4) All idea of dualism--the old Persian belief adopted in the Manichsean heresy, and in so many other false creeds, that of two principles eternally opposed to one another--presiding respectively over the realms of light and darkness--is distinctly here repudiated by Paul, who in the course of his argument casually introduces the Evil One--the Enemy of man, as one who at some remote period rebelled, was crushed, and condemned, but to whom, in the supreme Providence of God, some terrible power over man was left.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="accented">Good testimony from</span> for <span class="accented">a good report of</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">that</span> for <span class="accented">which</span>, A.V.

It is synonymous with the more common form, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3c9;</span>. (For the phrase, "they that are without" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3c9;</span>), as applied to those who are not members of the Church, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-11.htm">Mark 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-34.htm">John 9:34, 35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-12.htm">1 Corinthians 5:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-5.htm">Colossians 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:12</a>.)

The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> has the same sense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-10.htm">1 Timothy 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-11.htm">Matthew 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-32.htm">Mark 15:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-22.htm">Luke 6:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-14.htm">1 Peter 4:14</a>), and so in classical Greek. This reproach is further described as the <span class="cmt_word">snare of the devil</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-26.htm">2 Timothy 2:26</a>), because it is through these revilings that the devil seeks to impair the power of his ministry and frighten him from the exercise of it.

The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> does not indicate that there are two separate things into which he falls, but adds, as a description of the <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, that it is "a snare of the devil." The idea in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a> is analogous. There it is by <span class="accented">afflictions</span> that the devil seeks to devour the disciple who is weak in faith. Those afflictions might well be described as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>," a snare of the devil," set for weak souls. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 If a man desired the pastoral office, and from love to Christ, and the souls of men, was ready to deny himself, and undergo hardships by devoting himself to that service, he sought to be employed in a good work, and his desire should be approved, provided he was qualified for the office. A minister must give as little occasion for blame as can be, lest he bring reproach upon his office. He must be sober, temperate, moderate in all his actions, and in the use of all creature-comforts. Sobriety and watchfulness are put together in Scripture, they assist one the other. The families of ministers ought to be examples of good to all other families. We should take heed of pride; it is a sin that turned angels into devils. He must be of good repute among his neighbours, and under no reproach from his former life. To encourage all faithful ministers, we have Christ's gracious word of promise, Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world, Mt 28:20. And he will fit his ministers for their work, and carry them through difficulties with comfort, and reward their faithfulness.</body></html>
