The "death" thus made of none effect has a far more extended meaning than that separation of soul and body we are in the habit of calling death. It signifies that awful punishment of sin which is best described as the exact opposite to "eternal life." The death we are acquainted with by sad experience here is only the forerunner of the death eternal. Already to the believers in Jesus this death of the body counts for nothing; the time will come when it will even exist no more.<p><span class= "bld">And hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.</span>--The Greek word rendered "immortality" is more accurately translated by <span class= "ital">incorruption.</span> "Life" here is that true life, in its highest and completest sense, which includes the most perfect happiness--a happiness a foretaste of which is enjoyed on this side the grave; over it (this bliss) death now has no power--indeed, death is the gate, so to speak, through which we pass to its complete enjoyment. St. Paul says Christ "brought to light" life and incorruption, not only from having imparted to His own these glorious and divine attributes, but chiefly because He has displayed (or <span class= "ital">manifested</span>) the life and incorruption in His own resurrection body before our very eyes. When St. Paul wrote to Timothy, we must remember, many an eye-witness of the resurrection glories still walked on earth; with these must St. Paul, and Timothy too, often have conversed. Thus it can, with all literal truth, be predicated of Jesus Christ that He brought life and incorruption out of that darkness in which, as far as men were concerned, these things lay, into the clear and bright light of day. And as the hearers of Christ and the eye-witnesses of His resurrection were, when we consider this great mass of mankind, comparatively few, the medium by which these glorious truths were made known to men was the preaching of the gospel, in which gospel the Holy Ghost had enshrined both the words and the story of Christ.<p>On the Greek text of this grand verse Ellicott observes that it is remarkable that "Death," being then a known and ruling power, has in the original the article, while "Life" and "Incorruption," being <span class= "ital">then</span> only recently revealed and unknown powers, save to few, are written without the article.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="accented">Hath now been manifested</span> for <span class="accented">is now made manifest</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Christ Jesus</span> for <span class="accented">Jesus Christ</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">abolished</span> for <span class="accented">hath abolished</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">brought</span> for <span class="accented">hath brought</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">incorruption</span> for <span class="accented">immortality</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Hath now been manifested</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); a word of very frequent use by St. Paul. The same contrast between the long time during which God's gracious purpose lay hidden, and the present time when it was brought to light by the gospel, which is contained in this passage, is forcibly dwelt upon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1-12</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The appearing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>), applied here, as in the name of the Festival of the Epiphany, to the first advent, but in ch. 4:1 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a> and elsewhere applied to the second advent, "the glorious appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Abolished</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "destroyed," or "done away," or "made of none effect," as the word is variously rendered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-26.htm">1 Corinthians 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-11.htm">2 Corinthians 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Brought... to light</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>. Elsewhere rather "to give light," or "to enlighten" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-36.htm">Luke 11:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-32.htm">Hebrews 10:32</a>, etc.). For a full description of the abolition of death and the introduction of eternal life in its stead, through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5.htm">Romans 5</a>. and 6, and especially Romans 6:8-11. Through the gospel; because the gospel both declares the death and resurrection of Christ, and calls us to share in them. These mighty glories of the gospel were good reasons why Timothy should not be ashamed of the testimony of his Lord, nor shrink from the afflictions of the gospel. They were signal evidences of the power of God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:6-14 God has not given us the spirit of fear, but the spirit of power, of courage and resolution, to meet difficulties and dangers; the spirit of love to him, which will carry us through opposition. And the spirit of a sound mind, quietness of mind. The Holy Spirit is not the author of a timid or cowardly disposition, or of slavish fears. We are likely to bear afflictions well, when we have strength and power from God to enable us to bear them. As is usual with Paul, when he mentions Christ and his redemption, he enlarges upon them; so full was he of that which is all our salvation, and ought to be all our desire. The call of the gospel is a holy call, making holy. Salvation is of free grace. This is said to be given us before the world began, that is, in the purpose of God from all eternity; in Christ Jesus, for all the gifts that come from God to sinful man, come in and through Christ Jesus alone. And as there is so clear a prospect of eternal happiness by faith in Him, who is the Resurrection and the Life, let us give more diligence in making his salvation sure to our souls. Those who cleave to the gospel, need not be ashamed, the cause will bear them out; but those who oppose it, shall be ashamed. The apostle had trusted his life, his soul, and eternal interests, to the Lord Jesus. No one else could deliver and secure his soul through the trials of life and death. There is a day coming, when our souls will be inquired after. Thou hadst a soul committed to thee; how was it employed? in the service of sin, or in the service of Christ? The hope of the lowest real Christian rests on the same foundation as that of the great apostle. He also has learned the value and the danger of his soul; he also has believed in Christ; and the change wrought in his soul, convinces the believer that the Lord Jesus will keep him to his heavenly kingdom. Paul exhorts Timothy to hold fast the Holy Scriptures, the substance of solid gospel truth in them. It is not enough to assent to the sound words, but we must love them. The Christian doctrine is a trust committed to us; it is of unspeakable value in itself, and will be of unspeakable advantage to us. It is committed to us, to be preserved pure and entire, yet we must not think to keep it by our own strength, but by the power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in us; and it will not be gained by those who trust in their own hearts, and lean to their own understandings.</body></html>
