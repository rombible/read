Some commentators, who have found a difficulty in this unusual repetition of "the Lord," explain it thus: The expression, "the Lord grant," had become among Christians so completely "a formulary," that the second use of the word "Lord" was not noticed; and the prayer is thus-simply equivalent to "O that he may find mercy of the Lord." It seems, however, better to keep to the strict. literal meaning, and to understand the first "Lord," in the sense in which the term is always found in the Epistles of St. Paul, as a title of Christ; and the second "Lord" as used of the Father, to whom here (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-5.htm" title="But after your hardness and impenitent heart treasure up to yourself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;">Romans 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-16.htm" title="In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.">Romans 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-23.htm" title="To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,">Hebrews 12:23</a>), judgment at the last day is ascribed.<p><span class= "bld">In that day.</span>--The Apostle can never repay now--not even with thanks--the kindness his dead friend showed him in his hour of need; so he prays that the Judge of quick and dead may remember it in the awful day of judgment. It is worthy of note how St. Paul's thoughts here pass over the interval between death and judgment. It was on that day when the great white throne would be set up that he thought of the good deeds done in the body being recompensed by the righteous Judge. No doubt the expectation of the early Christians--in which expectation certainly St. Paul shared--of the speedy coming of the Lord influenced all thinking and speaking of the intermediate state of the soul between death and judgment, and almost seems to have effaced the waiting time from their minds.<p><span class= "bld">And in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</span>--These services rendered to St. Paul at Ephesus are placed side by side with those things he had done for him at Rome, but as they are mentioned after, they perhaps refer to kind offices undertaken for the prisoner by Onesiphorus <span class= "ital">after</span> his return from Rome to Ephesus. These things Timothy, the presiding pastor at Ephesus, would, of course, know in their detail better than St. Paul. The Greek word <span class= "greekheb">?????????</span><span class= "ital">,</span> rendered "he ministered," has given rise to the suggestion that Onesiphorus was a deacon at Ephesus. Although this is possible, still such an inference from one rather general expression is precarious.<p>This passage is famous from its being generally quoted among the very rare statements of the New Testament which seem to bear upon the question of the Romish doctrine of praying for the dead.<p>It may be well very briefly to touch on two points which suggest themselves as to the bearing of this passage on the doctrine in question. (1) Although we here, in common with Roman Catholic interpreters and the majority of the later expositors of the Reformed Church, assume that Onesiphorus was dead when St. Paul wrote to Timothy, and that the words used had reference to St. Paul's <span class= "ital">dead</span> friend, still it must be remembered that others, well worthy of being heard, writing many centuries before any doctrinal controversy on this subject arose, have held quite another opinion. Theodoret and Chrysostom (quoted by Alford) understood that Onesiphorus was with St. Paul at this time. (2) The prayer, whether it be taken as a prayer or an ejaculation, is simply the expression of an earnest desire, on the part of St. Paul, that the kind act of the <span class= "ital">dead</span>--assuming, contrary to the opinion of the above quoted Fathers, that he was dead--Onesiphorus towards himself may be remembered on that day when the books are opened before the Judge of quick and dead. It, indeed, only asks--looking fairly at the context--that an act of unrequited and devoted love shown in this life may be remembered in the final judgment. Without touching upon the controversy itself, it seems only just to point out the extreme precariousness of pressing this text--the only one in the New Testament really touching on this subject, and as to the interpretation of which expositors, as we have seen, are by no means in agreement--in support of a controverted doctrine.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="accented">To find</span> for <span class="accented">that he may find</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">ministered</span> for <span class="accented">ministered unto me</span>, A.V. (<span class="cmt_word">The Lord grant unto him</span>). The parenthesis seems only to be required on the supposition that the words <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1ff4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>., are a kind of play on the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> of the preceding verse. Otherwise it is better to take the words as a new sentence. The repetition of "the Lord" is remarkable, but nothing seems to hang upon it. The second <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> seems to suppose the Lord sitting on the judgment throne. As regards the amount of encouragement given by this passage to prayers for the dead (supposing Onesiphorus to have been dead), the mere expression of a pious wish or hope that he may find mercy is a very slender foundation on which to build the superstructure of prayer and Masses for the deliverance of souls from purgatory. <span class="cmt_word">In how many things,</span> etc. St. Paul does not say, as the A.V. makes him say, that Onesiphorus "ministered unto him" at Ephesus. It may have been so, but the words do not necessarily mean this. "What good service he did at Ephesus" would faithfully represent the Greek words; and this might describe great exertions made by Onesiphorus after his return from Rome to procure the apostle's acquittal and release by the intercession of the principal persons at Ephesus. This would, of course, be known to Timothy. It may, however, describe the ministerial labours and services of Onesiphorus at Ephesus after his return from Rome, or it may refer to former ministrations when Paul and Timothy were at Ephesus together (see Introduction). There seem to be no materials for arriving at absolute certainty on the point. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-18 The apostle mentions the constancy of Onesiphorus; he oft refreshed him with his letters, and counsels, and comforts, and was not ashamed of him. A good man will seek to do good. The day of death and judgment is an awful day. And if we would have mercy then, we must seek for it now of the Lord. The best we can ask, for ourselves or our friends, is, that the Lord will grant that we and they may find mercy of the Lord, when called to pass out of time into eternity, and to appear before the judgment seat of Christ.</body></html>
