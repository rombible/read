It seems, from the general tenor of the Epistle, that Timothy was deeply cast down by the imprisonment of St. Paul. Timothy, as well as the martyr himself, was conscious that the end of that great and glorious career of his old master was at last come; and the heart of the younger man sank--as well it might--under the prospect of having to fight the Lord's battle at Ephesus--that famous centre of Greek culture and of Oriental luxury--against enemies without and enemies within, alone, and without the help of the great genius, the master mind, and the indomitable courage of the man who for a quarter of a century had been the guiding spirit of Gentile Christianity, and his dear and intimate friend. So St. Paul now, persuaded that faith burned in his disciple's heart with the old steady flame, but knowing, too, that he was dispirited and heavy-hearted, was minded, if possible, to cheer up the fainting heart, and to inspire it with fresh courage to fight the Master's fight when he (St. Paul) had left the scene.<p><span class= "bld">That thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</span>--The Greek word rendered "stir up" literally means <span class= "ital">to kindle up, to fan into flame.</span> Chrysostom brings home the great lesson taught by this word, which belongs to all Christ's people alike, when he quotes <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-19.htm" title="Quench not the Spirit.">1Thessalonians 5:19</a>, "Quench not the Spirit;" for it is in our power both to quench this Spirit and also to fan it into flame. The "gift of God" here alluded to is that special gift of the Spirit conferred on Timothy at his ordination, and which included, in his case, powers necessary for the performance of the many and important duties to which he was in the providence of God called, especially those gifts of ruling and teaching which are necessary for the chief pastor's office. This "gift of God" was conferred through the medium of the hands laid on Timothy's head at his ordination at Lystra. In this act the presbytery at Lystra were joined with the Apostle. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-14.htm" title="Neglect not the gift that is in you, which was given you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.">1Timothy 4:14</a>.) We know that St. Paul frequently uses for his illustrations of Christian life scenes well known among the Greek heathen nations of the Old World, such as the Greek athletic games. Is it not possible (the suggestion is Wordsworth's) that the Apostle while here charging Timothy to take care that the sacred fire of the Holy Ghost did not languish in his heart, while urging him to watch the flame, to keep it burning brightly, to fan the flame if burning dimly--is it not possible that St. Paul had in mind the solemn words of the Roman law, "Let them watch the eternal flame of the public hearth"? (Cicero, <span class= "ital">de Legibus, </span>xi. 8.) The failure of the flame was regarded as an omen of dire misfortune, and the watchers, if they neglected the duty, were punished with the severest penalties.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="accented">For the which cause</span> for <span class="accented">wherefore</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">through the laying</span> for <span class="accented">by the putting</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">For which cause</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); so ver. 12 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-13.htm">Titus 1:13</a>, but nowhere else in St. Paul's Epistles, though common elsewhere. The clause seems to depend upon the words immediately preceding, "I am persuaded in thee also; for which cause," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Stir up</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>); here only in the New Testament, but found in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-27.htm">Genesis 45:27</a> and I Macc. 13:7, in an intransitive sense, "to revive." In both passages it is contrasted with a previous state of despondency (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-26.htm">Genesis 45:26</a>) or fear (1 Macc. 13:2). We must, therefore, conclude that St. Paul knew Timothy to be cast down and depressed by his own imprisonment and imminent danger, and therefore exhorted him to revive . 'the spirit of power, and of love, and of a sound mind," which was given him at his ordination. The metaphor is taken from kindling slumbering ashes into a flame by the bellows, and the force of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> is to show that the embers had gone down from a previous state of candescence or frame - "to rekindle, light up again." It is a favourite metaphor in classical Greek. <span class="cmt_word">The gift of God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-14.htm">1 Timothy 4:14</a> (where see note). <span class="cmt_word">The laying on of my hands,</span> together with those of the presbytery (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-14.htm">1 Timothy 4:14</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2, 3</a>). The laying on of hands was also the medium through which the Holy Ghost was given in Confirmation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-17.htm">Acts 8:17</a>), and in healing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-18.htm">Mark 16:18</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18, 23</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:6-14 God has not given us the spirit of fear, but the spirit of power, of courage and resolution, to meet difficulties and dangers; the spirit of love to him, which will carry us through opposition. And the spirit of a sound mind, quietness of mind. The Holy Spirit is not the author of a timid or cowardly disposition, or of slavish fears. We are likely to bear afflictions well, when we have strength and power from God to enable us to bear them. As is usual with Paul, when he mentions Christ and his redemption, he enlarges upon them; so full was he of that which is all our salvation, and ought to be all our desire. The call of the gospel is a holy call, making holy. Salvation is of free grace. This is said to be given us before the world began, that is, in the purpose of God from all eternity; in Christ Jesus, for all the gifts that come from God to sinful man, come in and through Christ Jesus alone. And as there is so clear a prospect of eternal happiness by faith in Him, who is the Resurrection and the Life, let us give more diligence in making his salvation sure to our souls. Those who cleave to the gospel, need not be ashamed, the cause will bear them out; but those who oppose it, shall be ashamed. The apostle had trusted his life, his soul, and eternal interests, to the Lord Jesus. No one else could deliver and secure his soul through the trials of life and death. There is a day coming, when our souls will be inquired after. Thou hadst a soul committed to thee; how was it employed? in the service of sin, or in the service of Christ? The hope of the lowest real Christian rests on the same foundation as that of the great apostle. He also has learned the value and the danger of his soul; he also has believed in Christ; and the change wrought in his soul, convinces the believer that the Lord Jesus will keep him to his heavenly kingdom. Paul exhorts Timothy to hold fast the Holy Scriptures, the substance of solid gospel truth in them. It is not enough to assent to the sound words, but we must love them. The Christian doctrine is a trust committed to us; it is of unspeakable value in itself, and will be of unspeakable advantage to us. It is committed to us, to be preserved pure and entire, yet we must not think to keep it by our own strength, but by the power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in us; and it will not be gained by those who trust in their own hearts, and lean to their own understandings.</body></html>
