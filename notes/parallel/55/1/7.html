(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-27.htm" title="Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you: not as the world gives, give I to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.">John 14:27</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm" title="But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.">Revelation 21:8</a>.) "Hath not given us," in this particular case, refers to the time when Timothy and St. Paul were admitted into the ministry. The Holy Spirit is no Spirit, be it remembered, which works cowardice in men. But the reference is also a far broader one than merely to the Holy Spirit conferred on ministers of the Lord at ordination. It is a grave reminder to Christians of every age and degree that all cowardice, all dread of danger, all shrinking from doing one's duty for fear of man's displeasure, proceeds <span class= "ital">not</span> from the Spirit of God.<p><span class= "bld">But of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</span>--Instead of rendering the Greek word by "a sound mind," it were better to substitute the translation, <span class= "ital">self-control.</span> The Holy Spirit works, in those to whom it is given, power, or <span class= "ital">strength, </span>to fight the fight of God, power, not only patiently to endure, but also to strike good blows for Christ--the power, for instance, of steadfastness in resisting temptation, the strong will which guides other weaker ones along the narrow way "of love." It works, too, in those to whom God gives the blessed gift, that strange, sweet love for others which leads to noble deeds of self-surrender--that love which never shrinks from a sacrifice which may benefit the friend or even the neighbour. And lastly, the Spirit works in us "self-control"--selbst-beherrschung--that power which, in the man or woman living in and mixing with the world, and exposed to its varied temptations and pleasures, is able to regulate and to keep in a wise subjection, passions, desires, impulses.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="accented">Gave us not</span> for <span class="accented">hath not given us</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a spirit of fearfulness</span> for <span class="accented">the spirit of fear</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and</span> for <span class="accented">of</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">discipline</span> for <span class="accented">of a sound mind</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">A spirit of fearfulness;</span> or, <span class="accented">cowardice</span>, as the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> exactly means in classical Greek, where it is very common, though it only occurs here in the New Testament. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> also has a reproachful sense, both in classical Greek, and also in the LXX., and in the New Testament (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-26.htm">Matthew 8:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-40.htm">Mark 4:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>). It seems certain, therefore, that St. Paul thought that Timothy's gentle spirit was in danger of being cowed by the adversaries of the gospel. The whole tenor of his exhortation, combined as it was with words of warm affection, is in harmony with this thought. Compare with the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Of power and love.</span> Power (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) is emphatically the attribute of the Holy Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-14.htm">Luke 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-13.htm">Romans 15:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4</a>, etc.), and that which he specially imparts to the servants of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-8.htm">Acts 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a>, etc.). Love is added, as showing that the servant of Christ always uses power in conjunction with love, and only as the means of executing what love requires. <span class="cmt_word">Discipline</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); only here in the New Testament; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-4.htm">Titus 2:4</a>, "to teach," A.V.; "to train," R.V. "Discipline" is not a very happy rendering, though it gives the meaning; "correction," or "sound instruction," is perhaps nearer. It would seem that Timothy had shown some signs of weakness, and had not boldly reproved and instructed in their duty certain offenders, as true love for souls required him to do. The phrase from Plutarch's 'Life of Cato,' quoted by Alford, exactly gives the force of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "For the amendment and correction of the rest." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:6-14 God has not given us the spirit of fear, but the spirit of power, of courage and resolution, to meet difficulties and dangers; the spirit of love to him, which will carry us through opposition. And the spirit of a sound mind, quietness of mind. The Holy Spirit is not the author of a timid or cowardly disposition, or of slavish fears. We are likely to bear afflictions well, when we have strength and power from God to enable us to bear them. As is usual with Paul, when he mentions Christ and his redemption, he enlarges upon them; so full was he of that which is all our salvation, and ought to be all our desire. The call of the gospel is a holy call, making holy. Salvation is of free grace. This is said to be given us before the world began, that is, in the purpose of God from all eternity; in Christ Jesus, for all the gifts that come from God to sinful man, come in and through Christ Jesus alone. And as there is so clear a prospect of eternal happiness by faith in Him, who is the Resurrection and the Life, let us give more diligence in making his salvation sure to our souls. Those who cleave to the gospel, need not be ashamed, the cause will bear them out; but those who oppose it, shall be ashamed. The apostle had trusted his life, his soul, and eternal interests, to the Lord Jesus. No one else could deliver and secure his soul through the trials of life and death. There is a day coming, when our souls will be inquired after. Thou hadst a soul committed to thee; how was it employed? in the service of sin, or in the service of Christ? The hope of the lowest real Christian rests on the same foundation as that of the great apostle. He also has learned the value and the danger of his soul; he also has believed in Christ; and the change wrought in his soul, convinces the believer that the Lord Jesus will keep him to his heavenly kingdom. Paul exhorts Timothy to hold fast the Holy Scriptures, the substance of solid gospel truth in them. It is not enough to assent to the sound words, but we must love them. The Christian doctrine is a trust committed to us; it is of unspeakable value in itself, and will be of unspeakable advantage to us. It is committed to us, to be preserved pure and entire, yet we must not think to keep it by our own strength, but by the power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in us; and it will not be gained by those who trust in their own hearts, and lean to their own understandings.</body></html>
