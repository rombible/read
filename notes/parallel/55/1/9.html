This is an inclusive word, and comprehends all God's dealings with us in respect to our redemption. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a>.) Again, as so frequently in these Pastoral Epistles, is the First Person of the blessed Trinity referred to as the Saviour.<p><span class= "bld">Us.</span>--Paul and Timothy, and all who believe on the name of the Lord Jesus, are included under "us."<p><span class= "bld">And called us with an holy calling.</span>--This explains the means by which God was pleased to save St. Paul and Timothy. <span class= "ital">He</span> called them. He--God the Father, to whom the act of calling is regularly ascribed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm" title="I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ to another gospel:">Galatians 1:6</a>); and the calling is said to be "holy," because it is a summons to share in the blessed communion of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-9.htm" title="God is faithful, by whom you were called to the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.">1Corinthians 1:9</a>). There is an inner as well as an outer calling; the "outer" comes through the preaching of the word, the inner by means of the voice of the Holy Ghost in the heart.<p><span class= "bld">Not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace.</span>--We are told in the next clause that "the grace" was given <span class= "ital">before the world began;</span> therefore "our works" could have had nothing to do with the divine purpose which was resolved on by God. As Chrysostom observes, "No one counselling with Him, but of His own purpose, the purpose originating in His own goodness." Calvin pithily remarks, "If God chose us before the creation of the world, He could not have considered the question of our works, which could have had no existence at a period when we ourselves were not." "But according to" (<span class= "ital">in pursuance of</span>) "His own purposes," with emphasis on "own"--that purpose which was prompted by nothing outward, but which arose solely out of the divine goodwill, or goodness, or love. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-11.htm" title="In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will:">Ephesians 1:11</a>.) The "grace" here is almost equivalent to the "mercy" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a>, "according to His mercy He saved us."<p><span class= "bld">Which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began.</span>--This grace was "given," not "destined," to us. It was given to us, in the person of Jesus Christ, before time was, and when our Redeemer, in the fulness of time, appeared, then was it made manifest. "Before the world began"--quite literally, "before eternal times;" the meaning here is "from all eternity," before times marked by the lapse of unnumbered ages.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="accented">Saved</span> for <span class="accented">hath saved</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a</span> for <span class="accented">an</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">times eternal</span> for <span class="accented">the world began</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Who saved us, and called us.</span> The saving was in the gift of his only begotten Son to be our Saviour; the calling is the work of the Holy Spirit drawing individual souls to Christ to be saved by him.

Putting all these passages together, and adverting to the classical meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, and its Latin equivalent, <span class="accented">aevum</span>, a "lifetime," we seem to arrive at the primary meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> as being a "generation," and then any long period of time analogous to a man's lifetime. Hence <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> would be times made up of successive generations, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> would mean at the very beginning of the times which consisted of human generations. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> would be one great generation, consisting of all the successive generations of mankind. The whole duration of mankind in this present world would be in this sense one vast <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, to be followed by we know not what succeeding ones. Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span> is contrasted with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, the idea being that the world has its lifetime analogous to the lifetime of a man. The same period may also be considered as made up of several shorter <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, the prediluvial, the patriarchal, the Mosaic, the Christian, and such like (see note to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-17.htm">1 Timothy 1:17</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:6-14 God has not given us the spirit of fear, but the spirit of power, of courage and resolution, to meet difficulties and dangers; the spirit of love to him, which will carry us through opposition. And the spirit of a sound mind, quietness of mind. The Holy Spirit is not the author of a timid or cowardly disposition, or of slavish fears. We are likely to bear afflictions well, when we have strength and power from God to enable us to bear them. As is usual with Paul, when he mentions Christ and his redemption, he enlarges upon them; so full was he of that which is all our salvation, and ought to be all our desire. The call of the gospel is a holy call, making holy. Salvation is of free grace. This is said to be given us before the world began, that is, in the purpose of God from all eternity; in Christ Jesus, for all the gifts that come from God to sinful man, come in and through Christ Jesus alone. And as there is so clear a prospect of eternal happiness by faith in Him, who is the Resurrection and the Life, let us give more diligence in making his salvation sure to our souls. Those who cleave to the gospel, need not be ashamed, the cause will bear them out; but those who oppose it, shall be ashamed. The apostle had trusted his life, his soul, and eternal interests, to the Lord Jesus. No one else could deliver and secure his soul through the trials of life and death. There is a day coming, when our souls will be inquired after. Thou hadst a soul committed to thee; how was it employed? in the service of sin, or in the service of Christ? The hope of the lowest real Christian rests on the same foundation as that of the great apostle. He also has learned the value and the danger of his soul; he also has believed in Christ; and the change wrought in his soul, convinces the believer that the Lord Jesus will keep him to his heavenly kingdom. Paul exhorts Timothy to hold fast the Holy Scriptures, the substance of solid gospel truth in them. It is not enough to assent to the sound words, but we must love them. The Christian doctrine is a trust committed to us; it is of unspeakable value in itself, and will be of unspeakable advantage to us. It is committed to us, to be preserved pure and entire, yet we must not think to keep it by our own strength, but by the power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in us; and it will not be gained by those who trust in their own hearts, and lean to their own understandings.</body></html>
