Instead of being dispirited by it, and by my arrest and close imprisonment, rather shouldest thou be stimulated to fresh and renewed exertions for the cause for which I suffer this desertion, these bonds.<p><span class= "bld">All they which are in Asia.</span>--It has been maintained by many, even by great Greek expositors such as Chrysostom, that "they which are in Asia" refers to certain Asiatic Christians who happened to be in Rome at the time of the Apostle's arrest and imprisonment. Others have even suggested that these Asiatics had gone to Rome for the purpose of bearing witness in St. Paul's favour, and finding that St. Paul's position was one of extreme danger, terrified for themselves--like others once before had been in the Christian story--lest they too should be involved in a like condemnation, forsook him and fled. But the simple and more obvious meaning is here to be preferred, and we assume as certain that the forsaking, the giving up St. Paul, took place in Asia itself. Large numbers of Christians, if not whole churches, repudiated their connection with the great father of Gentile Christianity, and possibly disobeyed some of his teaching. What, in fact, absolutely took place in Asia while St. Paul lay bound, waiting for death in Rome, had been often threatened in Corinth and in other centres. Party feeling ran high in those days, we know; and one of the most sorrowful trials the great-hearted St. Paul had to endure in the agony of his last witnessing for his Lord, was the knowledge that his name and teaching no longer was held in honour in some of those Asian churches so dear to him. The geographical term Asia is rather vague. It may--and indeed, strictly speaking, does--include Mysia, Phrygia, Lydia, Caria; but such a wide-spread defection from Pauline teaching seems improbable, and there is no tradition that anything of the kind ever took place. St. Paul probably wrote the term more in the old Homeric sense, and meant the district in the neighbourhood of the river Cayster;<p>"In Asian meadow by Cayster's streams."<p><span class= "ital">--Iliad</span> ii. 461.<p><span class= "bld">Of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</span>--These names would at once suggest to Timothy the men and the congregations of "Asia" to whom St. Paul was alluding--names well known, doubtless, then, and especially to persons in the position of Timothy; but no tradition has been preserved which throws any light on the lives and actions of these traitorous friends of St. Paul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="accented">That are</span> for <span class="accented">they which are</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">turned</span> for <span class="accented">be turned</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Phygelus</span> for <span class="accented">Phygellus</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Turned away from</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>). This verb is used, as here, governing an accusative of the person or thing turned away from, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-14.htm">Titus 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-25.htm">Hebrews 12:25</a>, as frequently in classical Greek. The use of the aorist here is important, as St. Paul does not mean to say that the Churches of Asia had all forsaken him, which was not true, and which it would be absurd to inform Timothy of if it were true, living as he was at Ephesus, the central city of Asia, but adverts to some occasion, probably connected with his trim before Nero, when they shrank from him in a cowardly way. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> means "the whole party in Asia" connected with the particular transaction to which St. Paul is alluding, and which was known to Timothy though it is not known to us. Perhaps he had applied to certain Asiatics, whether Christians or Jews or GraecoRomans, for a testimony to his orderly conduct in Asia, and they had refused it; or they may have been at Rome at the time, and avoided St. Paul; and among them Phygelus and Hermogenes, whose conduct may have been particularly ungrateful and unexpected. Nothing is known of either of them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-18 The apostle mentions the constancy of Onesiphorus; he oft refreshed him with his letters, and counsels, and comforts, and was not ashamed of him. A good man will seek to do good. The day of death and judgment is an awful day. And if we would have mercy then, we must seek for it now of the Lord. The best we can ask, for ourselves or our friends, is, that the Lord will grant that we and they may find mercy of the Lord, when called to pass out of time into eternity, and to appear before the judgment seat of Christ.</body></html>
