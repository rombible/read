This "testimony" of which Timothy was not to be ashamed, of course includes the sufferings and the shame of Christ. In these, before mocking, scornful men, must Timothy, as an example to the flock, rather glory; but "the testimony" signifies much more than what relates only to the Passion story. The Christian, instead of being ashamed of his "profession," must before the world show fearlessly that its hopes and its promises are his most precious treasure.<p><span class= "bld">Nor of me his prisoner.</span>--Nor must Timothy either then, or in days to come, be afraid of confessing before men that he had been the disciple and friend of the prisoner St. Paul, who had paid so dearly for the courage of his opinions. Nor Timothy, nor any Christian must shrink from openly espousing the unpopular cause of the Crucified, or from publicly declaring their sympathy with its hated martyrs.<p><span class= "bld">But be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel.</span>--More accurately rendered, <span class= "ital">but rather</span> <span class= "ital">suffer afflictions for the gospel.</span> But, on the contrary, instead of injuring the good cause by faint-hearted conduct, should Timothy rather be ready to suffer, if need be, with St. Paul, ready to bear some shame with him, ready to incur, perhaps, sore danger for the gospel's sake; and then St. Paul, emphasising his words, and strengthening with a new strength his argument and his exhortation, adds, "in accordance with the power of God"--yes, join with me in suffering, if needs be, for the gospel. Mighty and pitiful was God's power towards us: great, surely, in proportion should be <span class= "ital">our</span> readiness to suffer in return, if He asks this--as He is now doing from you and me--at our hands.<p><span class= "bld">According to the power of God.</span>--What power of God? has been asked. <span class= "ital">Not</span> according to the power we get from God, but according to the power which God has displayed towards us in our calling and in our marvellous salvation. In other words, God, with great power, has succoured us; surely we may be confident that He will never leave us, never desert us, but in the hour of our sorest trouble incurred for Him will help us, and will bring us safely through it. So Chrysostom, who, while asserting that suffering will be borne, but not in our strength but in God's, says, "Consider how thou hast been saved, and how thou hast been called;" inferring that He who has done so great things for man, in his calling and in his salvation, will never let him want for strength.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="accented">Be not ashamed therefore</span> for <span class="accented">be not thou therefore ashamed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">suffer hardship with the gospel</span> for <span class="accented">be thou partaker of the afflictions</span> of <span class="accented">the gospel</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Be not ashamed,</span> etc. The exhortation based upon the previous statement. The spirit of power and love must show itself in a brave, unflinching acceptance of all the hardships and afflictions incident to a faithful execution of his episcopal office (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Suffer hardship with the gospel.</span> This, of course, is a possible rendering, but an unnatural one, and not at all in harmony with the context. The force of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x3bd;</span> in <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (only found here in the New Testament and in the R.T. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-3.htm">2 Timothy 2:3</a>) is manifestly to associate Timothy with St. Paul in the afflictions of the gospel. "Be a fellow partaker with me of the afflictions," which is in obvious contrast with being ashamed of the testimony of the Lord and of the apostle his prisoner. <span class="accented">The gospel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the gospel, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>, "striving for the faith of the gospel" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), and as Chrysostom explains it: <span class="greek">&#x3a5;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (Huther). <span class="cmt_word">According to the power of God;</span> either "according to that spirit of power which God gave you at your ordination," or "according to the mighty power of God manifested in our salvation and in the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ." The latter seems to be what St. Paul had in his mind. Timothy ought to feel that this power was on his side. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:6-14 God has not given us the spirit of fear, but the spirit of power, of courage and resolution, to meet difficulties and dangers; the spirit of love to him, which will carry us through opposition. And the spirit of a sound mind, quietness of mind. The Holy Spirit is not the author of a timid or cowardly disposition, or of slavish fears. We are likely to bear afflictions well, when we have strength and power from God to enable us to bear them. As is usual with Paul, when he mentions Christ and his redemption, he enlarges upon them; so full was he of that which is all our salvation, and ought to be all our desire. The call of the gospel is a holy call, making holy. Salvation is of free grace. This is said to be given us before the world began, that is, in the purpose of God from all eternity; in Christ Jesus, for all the gifts that come from God to sinful man, come in and through Christ Jesus alone. And as there is so clear a prospect of eternal happiness by faith in Him, who is the Resurrection and the Life, let us give more diligence in making his salvation sure to our souls. Those who cleave to the gospel, need not be ashamed, the cause will bear them out; but those who oppose it, shall be ashamed. The apostle had trusted his life, his soul, and eternal interests, to the Lord Jesus. No one else could deliver and secure his soul through the trials of life and death. There is a day coming, when our souls will be inquired after. Thou hadst a soul committed to thee; how was it employed? in the service of sin, or in the service of Christ? The hope of the lowest real Christian rests on the same foundation as that of the great apostle. He also has learned the value and the danger of his soul; he also has believed in Christ; and the change wrought in his soul, convinces the believer that the Lord Jesus will keep him to his heavenly kingdom. Paul exhorts Timothy to hold fast the Holy Scriptures, the substance of solid gospel truth in them. It is not enough to assent to the sound words, but we must love them. The Christian doctrine is a trust committed to us; it is of unspeakable value in itself, and will be of unspeakable advantage to us. It is committed to us, to be preserved pure and entire, yet we must not think to keep it by our own strength, but by the power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in us; and it will not be gained by those who trust in their own hearts, and lean to their own understandings.</body></html>
