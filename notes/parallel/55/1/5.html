(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-3.htm" title="I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of you in my prayers night and day;">2Timothy 1:3</a>.)<p>It is more than probable that some special instance of this unfeigned faith on the part of the chief pastor of Ephesus had come to the Apostle's knowledge, and cheered that great loving heart of his while he languished in prison.<p><span class= "bld">Which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice . . .</span>--We know, in the course of his second missionary journey (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/16-1.htm" title="Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:">Acts 16:1-3</a>) St. Paul was brought into contact with this pious family at Lystra. It has been suggested that Lois, Eunice, and Timothy were kinsfolk of St. Paul, hence his intimacy with the family, and his knowledge of their faith; hence, too, perhaps, his devoted and unbroken friendship for Timothy. We are told (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-1.htm" title="Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:">Acts 16:1</a>) that this Eunice was a Jewess, married to a Greek. Lystra is no great distance from Tarsus--whence St. Paul came. The supposition is just possible; but it is only an ingenious thought, there being no data to support it. Of the names--Lois is the same with the more familiar Lais; Eunice is an equivalent of the Latin Victoria.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="accented">Having been reminded of</span> for <span class="accented">when I call to remembrance</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">in thee</span> for <span class="accented">that in thee</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Unfeigned</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>); as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-5.htm">1 Timothy 1:5</a> (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-9.htm">Romans 12:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-6.htm">2 Corinthians 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-22.htm">1 Peter 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-17.htm">James 3:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Having been reminded,</span> etc. (see preceding note). <span class="cmt_word">Thy grandmother Lois.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;</span> properly corresponds exactly to our word "mamma."

It is hardly a real word, and has no place in Stephens' 'Thes.,' except incidentally by comparison with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span>. It has, however, a classical usage. The proper word for a "grandmother" is <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Lois</span>; a name not found elsewhere, possibly meaning "good," or "excellent," from the same root as <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x1f77;&#x27;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. This and the following Eunice are examples of the frequent use of Greek or Latin names by Jews. Eunice, we know from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-1.htm">Acts 16:1</a>, was a Jewess and a Christian, as it would seem her mother Lois was before her. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 The promise of eternal life to believers in Christ Jesus, is the leading subject of ministers who are employed according to the will of God. The blessings here named, are the best we can ask for our beloved friends, that they may have peace with God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. Whatever good we do, God must have the glory. True believers have in every age the same religion as to substance. Their faith is unfeigned; it will stand the trial, and it dwells in them as a living principle. Thus pious women may take encouragement from the success of Lois and Eunice with Timothy, who proved so excellent and useful a minister. Some of the most worthy and valuable ministers the church of Christ has been favoured with, have had to bless God for early religious impressions made upon their minds by the teaching of their mothers or other female relatives.</body></html>
