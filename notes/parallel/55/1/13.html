Perhaps in the heart of St. Paul lurked some dread that the new glosses and specious explanations which the school of false teachers, so often referred to in these Pastoral Epistles, chose to add to the great doctrines of Christianity would be more likely to be listened to by Timothy when the hand of his old master was cold and the heart had ceased to beat; so he urged upon him to hold fast those inspired formularies he had heard from St. Paul's lips--such, for instance, as those "faithful sayings" which come before us so often in these Epistles to Timothy and Titus.<p><span class= "bld">In faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</span>--Timothy, in days to come, must mould and shape his teaching after the pattern of the teaching of his master St. Paul, and he must do it in that faith and love which alone comes from a life passed in communion with Christ.<p>The very frequent reference to the "sound, healthy words" in these Epistles by St. Paul, and from which he urges his disciples and successors never to depart, indicate to us the deep importance St. Paul and the first generation of believers attached to the very words and expressions used by the apostles and those who had been with the Lord.<p>False doctrines so easily might creep in, and loose forms of expression respecting great truths were an ever-present danger; a lax life, too, St. Paul knew, was the almost invariable accompaniment of false doctrine, hence these repeated exhortations of his to these representative teachers, Timothy and Titus, of the second generation of Christians, to hold fast the form of sound, healthy words--such words as these had again and again been heard from the lips of apostles and hearers of the Lord--"words which thou hast heard of me," St. Paul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="accented">Hold</span> for <span class="accented">hold fast</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">pattern</span> for <span class="accented">form</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">from</span> for <span class="accented">of</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Hold</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span>). This use of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in the pastoral Epistles is somewhat peculiar. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-19.htm">1 Timothy 1:19</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "holding faith;" in 1 Timothy 3:6, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "holding the mystery of the faith; ' and here, "hold the pattern," etc. It seems to have a more active sense than merely "have," and yet not to have the very active sense of "hold fast." It may, however, well be doubted whether <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span> here is used in even as strong a sense as in the other two passages, inasmuch as here it follows instead of preceding the substantive (see Alford, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The pattern</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-16.htm">1 Timothy 1:16</a> (where see note), where it manifestly means a "pattern," not a "form." The word signifies a "sketch," or "outline." St. Paul's meaning, therefore, seems to be: "For your own guidance in teaching the flock committed to you, and for a pattern which you will try and always copy, have before you the pattern or outline of sound words which you have heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus." <span class="cmt_word">Sound words</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-10.htm">1 Timothy 1:10</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">In faith and love</span>; either <span class="accented">hold the pattern in faith and love</span>, or <span class="accented">which you have heard in faith and love.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:6-14 God has not given us the spirit of fear, but the spirit of power, of courage and resolution, to meet difficulties and dangers; the spirit of love to him, which will carry us through opposition. And the spirit of a sound mind, quietness of mind. The Holy Spirit is not the author of a timid or cowardly disposition, or of slavish fears. We are likely to bear afflictions well, when we have strength and power from God to enable us to bear them. As is usual with Paul, when he mentions Christ and his redemption, he enlarges upon them; so full was he of that which is all our salvation, and ought to be all our desire. The call of the gospel is a holy call, making holy. Salvation is of free grace. This is said to be given us before the world began, that is, in the purpose of God from all eternity; in Christ Jesus, for all the gifts that come from God to sinful man, come in and through Christ Jesus alone. And as there is so clear a prospect of eternal happiness by faith in Him, who is the Resurrection and the Life, let us give more diligence in making his salvation sure to our souls. Those who cleave to the gospel, need not be ashamed, the cause will bear them out; but those who oppose it, shall be ashamed. The apostle had trusted his life, his soul, and eternal interests, to the Lord Jesus. No one else could deliver and secure his soul through the trials of life and death. There is a day coming, when our souls will be inquired after. Thou hadst a soul committed to thee; how was it employed? in the service of sin, or in the service of Christ? The hope of the lowest real Christian rests on the same foundation as that of the great apostle. He also has learned the value and the danger of his soul; he also has believed in Christ; and the change wrought in his soul, convinces the believer that the Lord Jesus will keep him to his heavenly kingdom. Paul exhorts Timothy to hold fast the Holy Scriptures, the substance of solid gospel truth in them. It is not enough to assent to the sound words, but we must love them. The Christian doctrine is a trust committed to us; it is of unspeakable value in itself, and will be of unspeakable advantage to us. It is committed to us, to be preserved pure and entire, yet we must not think to keep it by our own strength, but by the power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in us; and it will not be gained by those who trust in their own hearts, and lean to their own understandings.</body></html>
