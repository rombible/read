Onesiphorus, to whose house the Apostle prays the Lord to give mercy, had, early in this last imprisonment of St. Paul, arrived in Rome on matters connected probably with business. There he heard of the arrest of that great master whom he had known well in Asia, and sought him out in his prison. There is but little doubt that when St. Paul wrote this Epistle Onesiphorus' death must have recently taken place, both from the terms of this verse--where mercy is prayed, not for him, but for his house--and also from the expression "in that day," used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-18.htm" title="The Lord grant to him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered to me at Ephesus, you know very well.">2Timothy 1:18</a>. There is something strangely touching in this loving memory of "one" who, in his trouble, did <span class= "ital">not</span> forsake him, but whose devotion was rather increased by his danger, and this <span class= "ital">one</span> faithful friend would never be able again to show his love to the prisoner, for God had called him home.<p><span class= "bld">For he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain.</span>--"He oft refreshed me" does not imply that he ministered only to the Apostle's bodily needs when he was in prison, though the word, no doubt, includes this. But "he refreshed" him by frequent visits, by, no doubt, much anxious forethought in the matter of St. Paul's deliverance from prison and bonds, by a noble disregard of the personal danger which he incurred by his open intimacy with a prisoner charged, as St. Paul must have been, with treason against the empire. "<span class= "ital">He</span> was not ashamed of my chain." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-20.htm" title="For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.">Acts 28:20</a>, where "the chain" of another captivity is mentioned.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="accented">Grant</span> for <span class="accented">give</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Grant mercy</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). This connection of the words is only found here. <span class="cmt_word">The house of</span> <span class="cmt_word">Onesiphorus</span>. It is inferred from this expression, coupled with that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-19.htm">2 Timothy 4:19</a>, that Onesiphorus himself was no longer living; and hence ver. 18 (where see note) is thought by some to be an argument for prayers for the dead. The inference, further strengthened by the peculiar language of ver. 18, though not absolutely certain, is undoubtedly probable. The connection between this and the preceding verse is the contrast between the conduct of Phygelus and Hermogenes and that of Onesiphorus. They repudiated all acquaintance with the apostle in his day of trial; he, when he was in Rome, diligently sought him and with difficulty found him. and oft refreshed him with Christian sympathy and communion, acting with no less courage than love. He was no longer on earth to receive a prophet's reward (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-41.htm">Matthew 10:41</a>), but St. Paul prays that he may receive it in the day of Christ, and that meanwhile God may requite to his family the mercy he had showed to St. Paul. <span class="cmt_word">Refreshed me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">revived me</span>.

A good man will seek to do good. The day of death and judgment is an awful day. And if we would have mercy then, we must seek for it now of the Lord. The best we can ask, for ourselves or our friends, is, that the Lord will grant that we and they may find mercy of the Lord, when called to pass out of time into eternity, and to appear before the judgment seat of Christ.</body></html>
