Although the sense is a little obscured by the long parenthesis which intervenes, it seems clear that St. Paul's expression of thankfulness was for his remembrance of the unfeigned faith of Timothy and Lois and Eunice (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-5.htm" title="When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in you, which dwelled first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in you also.">2Timothy 1:5</a>). The whole passage might be written thus, "I thank God, whom I serve with the devotion of my forefathers with a pure conscience (as it happens that I have thee uppermost in my thought and prayers night and day, longing to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, in order that I may be filled with joy), when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith which is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and thy mother Eunice," &c.<p><span class= "bld">Whom I serve from my forefathers.</span>--That is, with the devotion and love I have inherited as a sacred family tradition. St. Paul was here referring, not to the great forefathers of the Jewish race--Abraham, Isaac, and the patriarchs--but to the members of his own family, who, he states, were religious, faithful persons. Van Oosterzee strangely concludes: "Dass Paulus diese historische kontinuitat der wahren Gottesverehrung in seinem geschlecht um so h�her schatzt, da er selbst stirbt, ohne kinder zu hinterlassen!"<p><span class= "bld">With pure conscience.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">in pure conscience.</span> The spiritual sphere in which St. Paul, as a Jew first, then as a Christian, served God. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-5.htm" title="Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:">1Timothy 1:5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">That without ceasing I have remembrance of thee.</span>--Better rendered, <span class= "ital">as unceasing is the remembrance which . . .</span> This long parenthetical sentence leads up to the point for which St. Paul was so deeply thankful to God; namely, the true faith of Timothy himself. These unstudied words tell us something of the inner life of such a one as St. Paul, how ceaselessly, unweariedly he prayed, night as well as day. The object, too, of those constant prayers of St. Paul was not St. Paul but Timothy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="accented">In a pure</span> for <span class="accented">with pure</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">how unceasing</span> for <span class="accented">that without ceasing</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">is my remembrance</span> for <span class="accented">I have remembrance</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">supplications</span> for <span class="accented">prayers</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">For whom I serve from my fathers in a pure conscience,</span> comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-1.htm">Acts 23:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">How unceasing,</span> etc. The construction of the sentence which follows is difficult and ambiguous. For what does the apostle give thanks to God? The answer to this question will give the clue to the explanation. The only thing mentioned in the context which seer, s a proper subject of thanksgiving is that which is named in ver. 5, viz. the "unfeigned faith" that was in Timothy. That this was a proper subject of thanksgiving we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-15.htm">Ephesians 1:15</a>, where St. Paul writes that, having heard of their faith in the Lord Jesus, he ceased not to give thanks for then-J, making mention of them in his prayers (see, too, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:2</a>). Assuming, then, that this was the subject of his thanksgiving, we notice especially the reading of the R.T., <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, "having received," and the note of Bengel that <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> means to be reminded of any one by another, as distinguished from <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, which is used when any one comes to your recollection without external prompting; both which fall in with our previous conclusion. And we get for the main sentence the satisfactory meaning: "I give thanks to God that I have received (or, because I have received) a most pleasant reminder (from some letter or visitor to which he does not further allude) of your unfeigned faith," etc, The main sentence clearly is: "I thank God... having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in thee." The intermediate words are, in Paul's manner, parenthetical and explanatory. Being about to say that it was at some special remembrance of Timothy's faith that he gave thanks, the thought arose in his mind that there was a continual remembrance of him day and night in his prayers; that he was ever thinking of him, longing to see him, and to have the tears shed at their parting turned into joy at their meeting again. And so he interposes this thought, and prefaces it with <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span> - not surely, "how," as in the R.V., but in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span>, "as," "just as." And so the whole passage comes out: "Just <span class="accented">as</span> I have an unceasing remembrance of you in my prayers, day and night, longing to see you, that the tears which I remember you shed at our parting may be turned into joy, <span class="accented">so</span> do I give special thanks to God on the remembrance of your faith." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 The promise of eternal life to believers in Christ Jesus, is the leading subject of ministers who are employed according to the will of God. The blessings here named, are the best we can ask for our beloved friends, that they may have peace with God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. Whatever good we do, God must have the glory. True believers have in every age the same religion as to substance. Their faith is unfeigned; it will stand the trial, and it dwells in them as a living principle. Thus pious women may take encouragement from the success of Lois and Eunice with Timothy, who proved so excellent and useful a minister. Some of the most worthy and valuable ministers the church of Christ has been favoured with, have had to bless God for early religious impressions made upon their minds by the teaching of their mothers or other female relatives.</body></html>
