Apart from any merit or work of his own, God chose him for the office. He neither aspired to it nor wished for it. The reference to the Almighty will in this Epistle is singularly in harmony with the spirit of calm resignation which breathes through it. It was that sovereign will which chose him as an Apostle, which guided him all through that eventful life of his, and which brought him to the prison of the Caesar, where, face to face with death, he wrote this last letter to his friend and disciple Timothy.<p><span class= "bld">According to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus.</span>--The Greek word rendered "according to" should here be translated <span class= "ital">"for</span> the promise of life." This preposition here denotes the object or intention of his appointment as apostle, which was to make known, to publish abroad, the promise of eternal life. Almost the first words of an Epistle, written evidently under the expectation of <span class= "ital">death, </span>dwell upon the promise of <span class= "ital">life</span>--the life which knows no ending--the life in Christ. The central point of all Evangelical preaching was the true, blessed life eternal, that life which, in the person of the Redeemer, was revealed to man, and which, through the Redeemer, is offered to the sinner.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="accented">Christ Jesus</span> for <span class="accented">Jesus Christ</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">the life</span> for <span class="accented">life</span>, A.V.

The blessings here named, are the best we can ask for our beloved friends, that they may have peace with God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. Whatever good we do, God must have the glory. True believers have in every age the same religion as to substance. Their faith is unfeigned; it will stand the trial, and it dwells in them as a living principle. Thus pious women may take encouragement from the success of Lois and Eunice with Timothy, who proved so excellent and useful a minister. Some of the most worthy and valuable ministers the church of Christ has been favoured with, have had to bless God for early religious impressions made upon their minds by the teaching of their mothers or other female relatives.</body></html>
