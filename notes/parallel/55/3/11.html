The question has been asked why, out of the pages of the closely written diary of his life's experiences, does St. Paul select the events which took place at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra? Was there anything special in what he endured in these places? The most satisfactory answer seems to be that, with regard to the general reader or hearer of this Epistle, what happened in these places, years before, were good examples of what had often taken place since. These were among the first cities in which St. Paul preached in the course of his missionary journeys. But a deeper reason existed for the choice of these places in <span class= "ital">his</span> case to whom the Epistle was originally addressed. What happened on that first journey would never be forgotten by Timothy: some of the incidents were among his first experiences with St. Paul of the work--others had taken place just before St. Paul took him as his friend and associate, and, no doubt, had been often discussed in Timothy's hearing in those anxious never-to-be-forgotten hours which preceded his choice of the calling of a missionary. Hearing of these very deeds of endurance done for the crucified Master, perhaps, not a little contributed to Timothy's resolve to emulate these acts, and to join himself closely to the heroic missionary teacher. Certainly, the memory of what happened then St. Paul knew would possess a strong and weighty influence with his disciple, even though the events themselves were only such as had been repeated often since in his long life's experience. (For details respecting what took place at Antioch, &c., see Acts 13, 14)<p><span class= "bld">What persecutions I endured.</span>--Some commentators understand these words as an exclamation: "What persecution I endured!" It is, however, better simply to translate the Greek, <span class= "ital">Such persecutions as I endured; </span>in other words, Thou hast been a witness of my sufferings, such [sufferings] as I endured at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra, such persecutions as I endured, but out of them, &c. Chrysostom remarks how both these clauses supply encouragement to the harassed servant of God. The first, that St. Paul displayed a noble readiness to endure persecution; the second, that God never left him alone. It was as though he said to Timothy, "surely no danger, no trouble, however great, need appall you. You know what I have gone through, yet in all God was with me and has kept me safe. Be sure He will be with you too."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="accented">Suffering</span> for <span class="accented">afflictions</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">what things befell me</span> for <span class="accented">which came unto me</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and</span> for <span class="accented">but</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Persecutions</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>); as <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-21.htm">Matthew 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-1.htm">Acts 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-50.htm">Acts 13:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-10.htm">2 Corinthians 12:10</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Sufferings</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); usually so rendered in the A.V.

For an account of the persecutions encountered by St. Paul at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13.htm">Acts 13, 14</a>. It was at St. Paul's second, or rather third, visit to Lystra that he chose Timothy for his companion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-1.htm">Acts 16:1-3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I endured</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>); not simply "suffered," but "underwent," willingly and firmly suffered (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-19.htm">1 Peter 2:19</a>). As regards the construction, the antecedent to <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and the difference between <span class="greek">&#x1f01;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> is that <span class="greek">&#x1f01;</span> would limit the reference to the actual <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra, but <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> extends the reference to all similar sufferings. The proper English rendering is "such as befell me." But the clause at the end of the sentence should be rendered "what great persecutions I endured." As Bengel notes, "<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> demonstrat rei gravitatem," and <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> preceding the substantive with which it agrees (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>), cannot be construed the same as <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> the relative. The sentence, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f35;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>, is an amplification of the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>: "Thou hast fully known my persecutions...viz. what great persecutions I endured." <span class="cmt_word">And out of them all,</span> etc. This is added for Timothy's encouragement, that he might stand fast in the face of persecutions and sufferings. <span class="cmt_word">Delivered me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). Had the apostle in his mind the clause in the Lord's Prayer, "Deliver us from evil" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>)? Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a>, where the resemblance is still more striking. Observe the testimony to Christ's omnipotence in this ascription to him, in both passages, of St. Paul's deliverance (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-10.htm">Acts 18:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:10-13 The more fully we know the doctrine of Christ, as taught by the apostles, the more closely we shall cleave to it. When we know the afflictions of believers only in part, they tempt us to decline the cause for which they suffer. A form of godliness, a profession of Christian faith without a godly life, often is allowed to pass, while open profession of the truth as it is in Jesus, and resolute attention to the duties of godliness, stir up the scorn and enmity of the world. As good men, by the grace of God, grow better, so bad men, through the craft of Satan, and the power of their own corruptions, grow worse. The way of sin is down-hill; such go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. Those who deceive others, deceive themselves, as they will find at last, to their cost. The history of the outward church, awfully shows that the apostle spake this as he was moved by the Holy Ghost.</body></html>
