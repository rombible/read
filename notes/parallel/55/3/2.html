But any such effort seems artificial. A certain connection seems to exist in some part; but when pressed to preserve the groups, a strained meaning has to be given to some of the terms. It seems, therefore, best simply to understand the catalogue as representing the various more prominent vices which appeared on the surface of Christian society, and threatened the very existence of the Church, even in those early times when Timothy ruled over the congregations of Christians at Ephesus. Hofmann, however, divides the catalogue contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/3-2.htm" title="For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,">2Timothy 3:2-4</a> into three groups, consisting of five, six, and seven terms, respectively.<p><span class= "bld">Lovers of their own selves.</span>--Selfishness well heads the dreary list. It is the true root of all sin.<p><span class= "bld">Covetous.</span>--More accurately rendered, <span class= "ital">lovers of money.</span> This "love of money" has been happily termed "the daughter of selfishness."<p><span class= "bld">Boasters.</span>--Those who arrogate to themselves honour which does not fairly belong to them.<p><span class= "bld">Proud.</span>--These are they who contemptuously look down on others beneath them, either in social position or wealth, or perhaps in natural gifts. The Latin, <span class= "ital">ostentatio, </span>represents the vice which affects the first of these classes--"the boasters;" and <span class= "ital">superbia, </span>that which affects the second class--"the proud."<p><span class= "bld">Blasphemers.</span>--The two vices just mentioned refer to man's conduct to his brother man; this alludes to his behaviour towards his God. The pride with which he looks down on his fellows develops itself into insolence in thought, if not in word, towards his God: and this is termed blasphemy.<p><span class= "bld">Disobedient to parents.</span>--The blasphemer of the Father which is in heaven is only too likely to train up little ones who, in their turn, will display a disobedience and disrespect of their earthly parents. The home life of the man who chooses not to know God in his heart will too easily reflect his evil thoughts and senseless pride.<p><span class= "bld">Unthankful.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">ungrateful.</span> The children who begin life with disobedience to their parents, with rare exceptions, are ungrateful to all others who may show them kindness in their life journey.<p><span class= "bld">Unholy.</span>--Unholy through their want of inward purity.

Men love to gratify their own lusts, more than to please God and do their duty. When every man is eager for what he can get, and anxious to keep what he has, this makes men dangerous to one another. When men do not fear God, they will not regard man. When children are disobedient to their parents, that makes the times perilous. Men are unholy and without the fear of God, because unthankful for the mercies of God. We abuse God's gifts, if we make them the food and fuel of our lusts. Times are perilous also, when parents are without natural affection to children. And when men have no rule over their own spirits, but despise that which is good and to be honoured. God is to be loved above all; but a carnal mind, full of enmity against him, prefers any thing before him, especially carnal pleasure. A form of godliness is very different from the power; from such as are found to be hypocrites, real Christians must withdraw. Such persons have been found within the outward church, in every place, and at all times. There ever have been artful men, who, by pretences and flatteries, creep into the favour and confidence of those who are too easy of belief, ignorant, and fanciful. All must be ever learning to know the Lord; but these follow every new notion, yet never seek the truth as it is in Jesus. Like the Egyptian magicians, these were men of corrupt minds, prejudiced against the truth, and found to be quite without faith. Yet though the spirit of error may be let loose for a time, Satan can deceive the nations and the churches no further, and no longer, than God will permit.</body></html>
