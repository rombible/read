The expression "writings" for the Scriptures is not found elsewhere in the New Testament; it is, however, used by Josephus.<p>Two powerful arguments have been here used by the Apostle to induce Timothy to remain steadfast to the great doctrines of faith, and neither to take anything from them or to add anything to them. The first presses upon him the <span class= "ital">source</span> whence he had learned them. He, better than any one, knew <span class= "ital">who</span> and <span class= "ital">what</span> St. Paul was, and the position he held with his brother Apostles, as one who had been in direct communication with the Lord Himself; and the second reminded him of his own early training, under his pious mother. He appealed, as it were, to Timothy's own deep knowledge of those Old Testament Scriptures. St. Paul's disciple would know that the great Christian doctrines respecting the Messiah were all based strictly on these Old Testament writings. Timothy had a double reason for keeping to the old paths pointed out by the first generation of teachers. He knew the authority of the master who instructed him; and then, from his own early and thorough knowledge of the Scriptures of the Jews, he was able to test thoroughly whether or no his master's teaching was in accordance with those sacred documents.<p><span class= "bld">Which are able to make thee wise unto salvation.</span>--The present participle rendered by "which are able" is noticeable, being here used to express the ever-present power of the Scriptures on the human heart. The Holy Scriptures had not completed their work on Timothy when, in his boyhood, he first mastered their contents. It was still going on. "Wise unto salvation" marks the glorious end and destination of the true wisdom which is gained by a study of these sacred books. Other wisdom has a different goal. In some cases it leads to power, fame, wealth; but this wisdom leads only to one goal--salvation. The last clause--"through faith which is in Christ Jesus"--points out the only way to use these Scriptures of the old covenant so as to attain through them the goal of all true wisdom--"eternal salvation." They must be read and studied in the light of faith in Jesus Christ. "Those (Old Testament) Scriptures, he (St. Paul) granteth, were able to make him wise unto salvation;" but, he addeth, "through the faith which is in Christ" (Hooker, <span class= "ital">Ecc. Polity, </span>i. 14, 4). Faith in Jesus must be the torch by the light of which these ancient prophecies and types must be read.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="accented">Babe</span> for <span class="accented">child</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">sacred writings</span> for <span class="accented">Holy Scriptures</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">And that from a babe,</span> etc. Another consideration urged as a reason for standing fast. He was no novice in the Scriptures.

The age of children is the age to learn; and those who would get true learning, must get it out of the Scriptures. They must not lie by us neglected, seldom or never looked into. The Bible is a sure guide to eternal life. The prophets and apostles did not speak from themselves, but delivered what they received of God, 2Pe 1:21. It is profitable for all purposes of the Christian life. It is of use to all, for all need to be taught, corrected, and reproved. There is something in the Scriptures suitable for every case. Oh that we may love our Bibles more, and keep closer to them! then shall we find benefit, and at last gain the happiness therein promised by faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the main subject of both Testaments. We best oppose error by promoting a solid knowledge of the word of truth; and the greatest kindness we can do to children, is to make them early to know the Bible.</body></html>
