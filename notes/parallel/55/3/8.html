No child of Israel could hear the name of Moses, the loved hero of the chosen people, unmoved; and to be told that these false teachers of Ephesus stood in the same relation to him and the Church of Christ as, in old days--in the never-to-be-forgotten Egyptian episode--those famous magicians Jannes and Jambres stood to Moses, would throw for Timothy a new light on all the words and works of these wicked and ambitious men. We can well imagine the comparison being repeated in many an assembly of the faithful, long after the great Apostle's death: how St. Paul had likened these early Heresiarchs to those evil men who before Pharaoh had dared to resist God and His servant Moses. These magicians, also termed wise men and sorcerers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/7-11.htm" title="Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.">Exodus 7:11-22</a>) at the court of Pharaoh, appear as the enemies of Moses. The names "Jannes" and "Jambres," though not given in the sacred text, are preserved in the oral tradition of Israel. The names are found in the Targum of Jonathan on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-11.htm" title="Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.">Exodus 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-22.htm" title="You shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.">Exodus 22:22</a>. These traditions relate how these men were sons of Balaam, and in the first instance were the instructors of Moses, though subsequently his enemies and opponents. One legend mentions them as perishing in the catastrophe when the waves of the Red Sea overwhelmed the armies of Egypt; another tradition speaks of their having met their death in the slaughter after the worship of the golden calf, the making of which they advised. It was their prophetic words, so say these legendary histories, which, foretelling the birth of Moses, induced Pharaoh to give this order for the destruction of the Jewish children. The later Jews distorted the names into John and Ambrose.<p><span class= "bld">So do these also resist</span> <span class= "bld">the truth.</span>--The point of comparison between the depraved teachers of Ephesus and these Egyptian sorcerers consisted in a persistent and deadly enmity to the truth, which existed in both cases. The life of the prophet Balaam, the traditionary father of this Jannes and Jambres, supplies a vivid illustration of this malignant and persistent hatred of what is known and felt to be true. That these Ephesian heretics in like manner availed themselves, or pretended to avail themselves of occult power is just probable, though in the comparison this point is of but little moment. We know, however, that the claim at least to possess mysterious and unearthly powers was often made by covetous and worldly men in these times: as, for instance, by Simon Magus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/8-9.htm" title="But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:">Acts 8:9-24</a>), by Elymas the sorcerer, the false prophet and Jew in Cyprus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/13-6.htm" title="And when they had gone through the isle to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:">Acts 13:6-12</a>). See also the episode of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/19-18.htm" title="And many that believed came, and confessed, and showed their deeds.">Acts 19:18-20</a>, when "many which used curious arts came to Paul and his companions, and confessed and shewed their deeds."<p><span class= "bld">Men of</span> <span class= "bld">corrupt minds.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">corrupted in their minds.</span> Timothy might possibly have been induced to regard these evil men, though erring in some particulars, as still of the flock of Christ, to which they belonged nominally; but he was now instructed that they were simply enemies to the truth: that it was vain to hope that they would ever come to a knowledge of the truth, for their "mind," the human spirit, the medium of communication with the Holy Spirit of God, was corrupted. There was no common ground of faith, save in the bare name of Christian, between Timothy and these men, for they, in the matter of faith, had been tried and found wanting.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="accented">And like</span> for <span class="accented">now</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">withstand</span> for <span class="accented">resist</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">corrupted in mind</span> for <span class="accented">of corrupt minds</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">And</span>; <span class="accented">but</span> would be better. <span class="cmt_word">Jannes and Jambres;</span> the traditional names of the magicians who opposed Moses; and, if Origen can be trusted, there was an apocryphal book called by their names.

Nat.,' 31:2), who probably got his information from a work of Sergius Paulus off magic, of which the materials were furnished by Elymas the sorcerer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-6.htm">Acts 13:6-8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Withstood</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); the same word as is used of Elymas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-8.htm">Acts 13:8</a> (so ch. 4:15 and elsewhere). <span class="cmt_word">Corrupted in mind</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>); elsewhere only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-12.htm">2 Peter 2:12</a>, in the sense of" perishing," being "utterly destroyed," which is the proper meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> Here in a moral sense <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> means men whose understanding is gone, and perished, as <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> means one whose hearing has perished - who is deaf.

Men love to gratify their own lusts, more than to please God and do their duty. When every man is eager for what he can get, and anxious to keep what he has, this makes men dangerous to one another. When men do not fear God, they will not regard man. When children are disobedient to their parents, that makes the times perilous. Men are unholy and without the fear of God, because unthankful for the mercies of God. We abuse God's gifts, if we make them the food and fuel of our lusts. Times are perilous also, when parents are without natural affection to children. And when men have no rule over their own spirits, but despise that which is good and to be honoured. God is to be loved above all; but a carnal mind, full of enmity against him, prefers any thing before him, especially carnal pleasure. A form of godliness is very different from the power; from such as are found to be hypocrites, real Christians must withdraw. Such persons have been found within the outward church, in every place, and at all times. There ever have been artful men, who, by pretences and flatteries, creep into the favour and confidence of those who are too easy of belief, ignorant, and fanciful. All must be ever learning to know the Lord; but these follow every new notion, yet never seek the truth as it is in Jesus. Like the Egyptian magicians, these were men of corrupt minds, prejudiced against the truth, and found to be quite without faith. Yet though the spirit of error may be let loose for a time, Satan can deceive the nations and the churches no further, and no longer, than God will permit.</body></html>
