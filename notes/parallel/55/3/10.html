See <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-3.htm" title="It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus,">Luke 1:3</a>, where the same word is rendered, in the English version: "having had perfect understanding," having traced up to their source all the events relating to the foundation of Christianity. Here St. Paul recalls to Timothy's mind what had been his--St. Paul's--life, and words, and works. No one knew the history of this life like Timothy, the pupil and the friend, who had been long trained to assist in carrying on his teacher's work after St. Paul was removed. And this appeal to Timothy's recollection of the past has two distinct purposes: (1) It was to contrast that life of St. Paul's, with which the disciple was so well acquainted, with the lives of those false men, of whom Timothy was warned so earnestly, who were poisoning the stream of Christianity at Ephesus; and (2) the memory of the master was to serve as a spur to the disciple, the heroic faith of the old man was to act as an incentive to the young teacher to suffer bravely in his turn.<p>With this pattern of steady faith and heroic work before his eyes, Timothy would never be able to endure the wretched mock Christianity these new teachers were labouring to introduce into the communities of the believers of Asia; he would at once separate himself and his from these evil influences.<p><span class= "bld">My doctrine.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">teaching, </span>in which the leading of a pure self-denying life was inseparably bound up with a belief in the great Christian doctrines. "<span class= "ital">This</span> hast thou, my pupil from boyhood, known in all its details. Thou hast known how I taught others."<p><span class= "bld">Manner of life.</span>--"And also how I lived myself:" "my ways which be in Christ," as he once before phrased it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-17.htm" title="For this cause have I sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.">1Corinthians 4:17</a>), "my conduct."<p><span class= "bld">Purpose.</span>--"My purpose--from which you know I never swerved--of remaining true to the Gospel of my Lord and to my great life's mission to the Gentiles." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-23.htm" title="Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:">Acts 2:23</a>, where the word is used in respect to others' purpose.)<p><span class= "bld">Faith.</span>--Possibly, <span class= "ital">trust in God, </span>but better, St. Paul's faith or belief in the fundamental doctrines of Christianity.<p><span class= "bld">Longsuffering.</span>--Towards his many bitter adversaries, especially those among his own countrymen. In spite of all that long, unwearied, sleepless persecution, which he, the former Pharisee leader, endured at the hands of the Jews, he loved Israel to the end, with a love intense as it was changeless, loved them even to be willing for their sake to give up his eternal hopes. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm" title="For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh:">Romans 9:3</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Charity.</span>--My love, which (in his own sunny words) beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things--the love which never faileth. (See 1 Corinthians 13)<p><span class= "bld">Patience.</span>--That characteristic virtue of St. Paul, that "brave patience" which hopefully endured opposition to his favourite schemes, which cheerfully bore the most painful suffering when it came as a consequence of work in his Master's cause. This concluding word led naturally on to the brief catalogue of persecutions of the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="accented">Didst follow my teaching</span> for <span class="accented">hast fully known my doctrine</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">conduct</span> for <span class="accented">manner of life</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">love</span> for <span class="accented">charity</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Didst follow</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, which is the R.T. for <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, in the perfect, which is the T.R.). The evidence for the two readings is nicely balanced. But St. Paul uses the perfect in l Timothy 4:6 (where see note), and it seems highly improbable that he here used the aorist in order to convey a rebuff to Timothy by insinuating that he had once followed, but that he was doing so no longer. The sentence, "thou didst follow," etc., is singularly insipid. The A.V. "thou hast fully known" gives the sense fully and clearly. Timothy had fully known St. Paul's whole career, partly from what he had heard, and partly from what he had been an eyewitness cf. <span class="cmt_word">My teaching.</span> How different from that of those impostors! <span class="cmt_word">Conduct</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1fc7;</span>); here only in the New Testament, but found in the LXX. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-20.htm">Esther 2:20</a> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "her manner of life" - her behaviour towards Mordecai, where there is nothing to answer to it in the Hebrew text); 2 Macc. 4:16 (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>); 6:8; 11:24. Aristotle uses <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span> for "conduct," or "mode of life" ('Ethics'), and Polybius (4:74, 14), quoted by Alford, has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "way" or "manner of life." The A.V. "manner of life" is a very good rendering. <span class="cmt_word">Purpose</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); that which a person sets before him as the end to be attained (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-23.htm">Acts 11:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-13.htm">Acts 27:13</a>; 2 Macc. 3:8; and in Aristotle, Polybius, and others). Used often of God's eternal purpose, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, ch. 1:9; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>, etc. In enumerating these and the following," faith, long suffering, charity, and patience," St. Paul doubtless had in view, not self-glorification, which was wholly alien to his earnest, self-denying character, but the mention of those qualities which he saw were most needed by Timothy. <span class="cmt_word">Long suffering</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>); as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-16.htm">1 Timothy 1:16</a>, of the long suffering of Jesus Christ towards himself, and elsewhere frequently of human patience and forbearance towards others. <span class="cmt_word">Patience</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1fc7;</span>). This is exercised in the patient endurance of afflictions for Christ's sake. It is coupled, as here, with <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x391;</span>, long suffering, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-11.htm">Colossians 1:11</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:10-13 The more fully we know the doctrine of Christ, as taught by the apostles, the more closely we shall cleave to it. When we know the afflictions of believers only in part, they tempt us to decline the cause for which they suffer. A form of godliness, a profession of Christian faith without a godly life, often is allowed to pass, while open profession of the truth as it is in Jesus, and resolute attention to the duties of godliness, stir up the scorn and enmity of the world. As good men, by the grace of God, grow better, so bad men, through the craft of Satan, and the power of their own corruptions, grow worse. The way of sin is down-hill; such go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. Those who deceive others, deceive themselves, as they will find at last, to their cost. The history of the outward church, awfully shows that the apostle spake this as he was moved by the Holy Ghost.</body></html>
