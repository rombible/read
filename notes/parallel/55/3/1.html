St. Paul now (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-1.htm" title="This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.">2Timothy 3:1</a>), having told him that although there was no reason to fear, yet warns him that grave dangers to the Church <span class= "ital">would</span> surely arise, and that God's servants, like Timothy, must be prepared to combat.<p><span class= "bld">In the last days.</span>--The majority of commentators have referred "the last days" here spoken of to the period immediately preceding the second coming of the Lord--a day and an hour somewhere in the future but hidden, not merely from all men, but from the angels, and even from the Son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-32.htm" title="But of that day and that hour knows no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.">Mark 13:32</a>).<p>It seems, however, more in accordance with such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1John 2:18</a> : "Little children, it is the last time"--where <span class= "ital">the present, </span>and not an uncertain future is alluded to--to understand "the last days "as that period, probably of very long duration, extending from the days of the first coming of Messiah--in which time St. Paul lived--to the second coming of Christ in judgment. The Jewish Rabbis of the days of St. Paul were in the habit of speaking of two great periods of the world's history--"this age," and "the age to come." The former of these, "this age," including all periods up to Messiah's advent; the latter, "the age to come," including all periods subsequent to the appearance of Messiah. We find the same idea embodied later in the Talmud (treatise "Sanhedrim") 6,000 years are mentioned as the duration of the world, 2,000 years, waste or chaos, 2,000 years under the law, 2,000 years the days of Messiah." This last period, "the days of Messiah," are often alluded to by the Hebrew prophets under the expression, "in the last days"--literally, <span class= "ital">in the end of days.</span> (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-5.htm" title="Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.">Hosea 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-1.htm" title="But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow to it.">Micah 4:1</a>.) The words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-5.htm" title="Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.">2Timothy 3:5</a>, "from such turn away," would require certainly a strained interpretation if we are to suppose that the "last days" referred to a time immediately preceding the end, or, in other words, the last period of the Christian era. The sad catalogue of vices is, alas, one with which all ages of the Church of Christ has been too well acquainted. The Christian teacher has no need to look forward to a future time of deeper iniquity, when in the Church of the living God will be found those who will deserve the dreary titles of this passage. The Church of his own age will supply him with examples of many such, for "In a great house . . . are there not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood, and earth, and some to honour and some to dishonour."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="accented">But know this</span> for <span class="accented">this know also</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">grievous</span> for <span class="accented">perilous</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Grievous times</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>). "Grievous" is not a very good rendering. "Perilous," though in some contexts it is a right rendering, is a little too restricted here. "Difficult," "trying," "uneasy," or the like, is nearer the sense. They are times when a Christian hardly knows which way to turn or what to do. He has to live under a constant sense of hindrance and difficulty of one sort or another. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-9 Even in gospel times there would be perilous times; on account of persecution from without, still more on account of corruptions within. Men love to gratify their own lusts, more than to please God and do their duty. When every man is eager for what he can get, and anxious to keep what he has, this makes men dangerous to one another. When men do not fear God, they will not regard man. When children are disobedient to their parents, that makes the times perilous. Men are unholy and without the fear of God, because unthankful for the mercies of God. We abuse God's gifts, if we make them the food and fuel of our lusts. Times are perilous also, when parents are without natural affection to children. And when men have no rule over their own spirits, but despise that which is good and to be honoured. God is to be loved above all; but a carnal mind, full of enmity against him, prefers any thing before him, especially carnal pleasure. A form of godliness is very different from the power; from such as are found to be hypocrites, real Christians must withdraw. Such persons have been found within the outward church, in every place, and at all times. There ever have been artful men, who, by pretences and flatteries, creep into the favour and confidence of those who are too easy of belief, ignorant, and fanciful. All must be ever learning to know the Lord; but these follow every new notion, yet never seek the truth as it is in Jesus. Like the Egyptian magicians, these were men of corrupt minds, prejudiced against the truth, and found to be quite without faith. Yet though the spirit of error may be let loose for a time, Satan can deceive the nations and the churches no further, and no longer, than God will permit.</body></html>
