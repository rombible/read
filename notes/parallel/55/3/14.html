Evil teaching would become worse; the opposition to truth would, as the ages rolled on, become more intense; but Timothy and his successors must remember that there was to be no development in the fundamental doctrines of his most holy faith. He had (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-10.htm" title="But you have fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, patience,">2Timothy 3:10</a>) fully known St. Paul's doctrine--that doctrine which St. Paul had received directly from the Holy Spirit of God.<p><span class= "bld">Knowing of whom thou hast learned them.</span>--There is some doubt whether the Greek word rendered "whom" is in the singular or plural, the older authorities being nearly equally balanced. The reading here of the singular has been adopted with the Syriac versions, Chrysostom, Augustine, and the Vulgate. The reference then is to St. Paul. If the plural, were adopted, then the reference would probably be to St. Paul and Barnabas, or to some other distinguished teacher. Some commentators believe that Lois and Eunice are here alluded to, the pious mother and grandmother of Timothy. This, however, seems unlikely: for such a reminiscence, although a touching memory and one likely to appeal to his affection, would hardly be of that weighty and important character as to warrant its introduction into this solemn exhortation; besides, any reference to home and family reminiscences would be included in the next verse: "From a child thou hast known," &c.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="accented">Abide</span> for <span class="accented">continue</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Abide</span> <span class="cmt_word">thou</span>, etc. Be not like these juggling heretics, blown about by every wind of doctrine, and always seeking some new thing, but abide in the old truths which thou hast learnt from thy childhood. <span class="cmt_word">Hast been assured of</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>); only here in the New Testament, but found in 2 Macc. 7:24 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-36.htm">1 Kings 1:36</a>. In classical Greek it has the same sense as here (among others), "to be made sure of a thing." <span class="cmt_word">Of whom thou hast learned</span> <span class="cmt_word">them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, or, according to another reading of nearly equal authority, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). If <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is the right reading, it must refer either to God or to St. Paul. In favour of its referring to God is the expression in the Prophet Isaiah commented upon by our Lord in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-45.htm">John 6:45</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> answers to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; the promise concerning the Comforter, "He shall teach you all things" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>, etc.); and the very similar reasoning of St. John, when he is exhorting his "little children" to stand fast in the faith, in spite of those that seduced them: "Let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning;" for "the anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things,...and even as it hath taught yon, abide in him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-24.htm">1 John 2:24-28</a>); and other similar passages. There would obviously be great force in reminding Timothy that he had received the gospel under the immediate teaching of the Holy Spirit, and that it would be a shameful thing for him to turn aside under the influence of those impostors. If <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> does not refer to God, it must refer to St. Paul. If, on the other hand, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> is the true reading (which is less probable), it must refer to Lois and Eunice, which seems rather feeble. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:14-17 Those who would learn the things of God, and be assured of them, must know the Holy Scriptures, for they are the Divine revelation. The age of children is the age to learn; and those who would get true learning, must get it out of the Scriptures. They must not lie by us neglected, seldom or never looked into. The Bible is a sure guide to eternal life. The prophets and apostles did not speak from themselves, but delivered what they received of God, 2Pe 1:21. It is profitable for all purposes of the Christian life. It is of use to all, for all need to be taught, corrected, and reproved. There is something in the Scriptures suitable for every case. Oh that we may love our Bibles more, and keep closer to them! then shall we find benefit, and at last gain the happiness therein promised by faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the main subject of both Testaments. We best oppose error by promoting a solid knowledge of the word of truth; and the greatest kindness we can do to children, is to make them early to know the Bible.</body></html>
