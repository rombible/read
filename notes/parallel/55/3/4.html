The sorrowful catalogue began with "love of self," that unhappy vice which excludes all love for others; it closes with that "love of pleasure" which shuts out all love of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="accented">Headstrong</span> for <span class="accented">heady</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">puffed up</span> for <span class="accented">high minded</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">pleasure</span> for <span class="accented">pleasures</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">rather</span> for <span class="accented">more</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Traitors</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-16.htm">Luke 6:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-52.htm">Acts 7:52</a>. It does not mean traitors to their king or country, but generally betrayers of the persons who trust in them, and of the cause of the trust committed to them; perhaps specially, as Bishop Ellicott suggests, of their brethren in times of persecution. <span class="cmt_word">Headstrong</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>); as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-36.htm">Acts 19:36</a>.

Philo, quoted by Bishop Ellicott (from Wetstein), has exactly the same contrast: <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>.

Men love to gratify their own lusts, more than to please God and do their duty. When every man is eager for what he can get, and anxious to keep what he has, this makes men dangerous to one another. When men do not fear God, they will not regard man. When children are disobedient to their parents, that makes the times perilous. Men are unholy and without the fear of God, because unthankful for the mercies of God. We abuse God's gifts, if we make them the food and fuel of our lusts. Times are perilous also, when parents are without natural affection to children. And when men have no rule over their own spirits, but despise that which is good and to be honoured. God is to be loved above all; but a carnal mind, full of enmity against him, prefers any thing before him, especially carnal pleasure. A form of godliness is very different from the power; from such as are found to be hypocrites, real Christians must withdraw. Such persons have been found within the outward church, in every place, and at all times. There ever have been artful men, who, by pretences and flatteries, creep into the favour and confidence of those who are too easy of belief, ignorant, and fanciful. All must be ever learning to know the Lord; but these follow every new notion, yet never seek the truth as it is in Jesus. Like the Egyptian magicians, these were men of corrupt minds, prejudiced against the truth, and found to be quite without faith. Yet though the spirit of error may be let loose for a time, Satan can deceive the nations and the churches no further, and no longer, than God will permit.</body></html>
