These, by claiming the title of Christians, wearing before men the uniform of Christ, but by their lives dishonouring His name, did the gravest injury to the holy Christian cause. Another dreary catalogue of vices St. Paul gives in the Epistle to the Romans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-29.htm" title="Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,">Romans 1:29</a>, and following verses); but in that passage he paints the sins of Paganism. Here he describes the characteristics of a new Paganism, which went under the name of Christianity.<p><span class= "bld">From such turn away.</span>--<span class= "ital">These, </span>daring to assume the sacred name, no doubt with the thought of claiming its glorious promises, without one effort to please the Master or to do honour to His name--<span class= "ital">these</span> were to be openly shunned by such as Timothy. No half measures were to be adopted towards <span class= "ital">these, </span>who tried to deceive their neighbours and possibly deceived themselves. The Pagan was to be courteously entreated, for in God's good time the glory of the Lord might shine, too, on those now sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death. The heretic, seduced by false men from the school of the Apostles, where the life as well as the doctrine of Jesus was taught, was to be gently instructed. Perhaps God would lead him once more home. But <span class= "ital">these, </span>who, while pretending to belong to Jesus, lived the degraded life of the heathen, were to be shunned. No communion, no friendly intercourse was possible between the hypocrite and the Christian.<p>The command here is so definite--"from these turn away"--that any theory which would relegate the vices just enumerated to a distant future would require, as above stated, that a strained and unnatural meaning should be given to this positive direction to Timothy. The plain and obvious signification of the passage is: men committing the sins alluded to lived <span class= "ital">then</span> in the Church over which Timothy presided; they were to be avoided by the chief presbyter and his brethren.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="accented">Holding</span> for <span class="accented">having</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">hating denied</span> for <span class="accented">denyiny</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">these also</span> for <span class="accented">such</span>, A.V. Holding (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>). There is no reason to change "having." Perhaps "indeed" after "having" would give the emphasis conveyed by <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> preceding the object. <span class="cmt_word">A form</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>).

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-20.htm">Romans 2:20</a>, the only other place in the New Testament where <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> occurs, there is no contrast, and so it has the sense of a "true sketch" or "delineation." <span class="cmt_word">Having denied</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); possibly more correct than the A.V. "denying," though the difference, if any, is very slight. The meaning is that by their life and character and conversation they gave the lie to their Christian profession. Christianity with them was an outward form, not an inward living power of godliness. <span class="cmt_word">From these also</span> does not give the sense at all clearly. The A.V. does, though it omits the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, which is not wanted in English. In the Greek it marks an additional circumstance in the case of those of whom he is speaking, viz. that they are to be turned away from as hopeless. <span class="cmt_word">Turn away</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>); only here in the New Testament, or, at least in the middle voice, in the LXX.; but frequent in classical Greek in different senses. St. Paul uses <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in the same sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>. "This command shows that the apostle treats the symptoms of the last times as in some respects present" (Alford). With this catena of epithets comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-29.htm">Romans 1:29-31</a>; and, though of an opposite character, the string of adjectives in Wisd. 7:22, 23. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-9 Even in gospel times there would be perilous times; on account of persecution from without, still more on account of corruptions within. Men love to gratify their own lusts, more than to please God and do their duty. When every man is eager for what he can get, and anxious to keep what he has, this makes men dangerous to one another. When men do not fear God, they will not regard man. When children are disobedient to their parents, that makes the times perilous. Men are unholy and without the fear of God, because unthankful for the mercies of God. We abuse God's gifts, if we make them the food and fuel of our lusts. Times are perilous also, when parents are without natural affection to children. And when men have no rule over their own spirits, but despise that which is good and to be honoured. God is to be loved above all; but a carnal mind, full of enmity against him, prefers any thing before him, especially carnal pleasure. A form of godliness is very different from the power; from such as are found to be hypocrites, real Christians must withdraw. Such persons have been found within the outward church, in every place, and at all times. There ever have been artful men, who, by pretences and flatteries, creep into the favour and confidence of those who are too easy of belief, ignorant, and fanciful. All must be ever learning to know the Lord; but these follow every new notion, yet never seek the truth as it is in Jesus. Like the Egyptian magicians, these were men of corrupt minds, prejudiced against the truth, and found to be quite without faith. Yet though the spirit of error may be let loose for a time, Satan can deceive the nations and the churches no further, and no longer, than God will permit.</body></html>
