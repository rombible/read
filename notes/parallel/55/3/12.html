"No cross, no crown," is one of the watchwords of the faith. To the statement, "all that will live godly," it is noticeable that the Apostle adds "in Christ Jesus:" thus telling us there can be no true piety except in communion with Him. So Bengel: "Extra Jesum Christum nulla pietas." And piety, adds St. Paul, will ever suffer persecution; for the world is at enmity with the kingdom of God. "Because ye are not of the world . . . therefore the world hateth you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-19.htm" title="If you were of the world, the world would love his own: but because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.">John 15:19</a>; so, too, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-22.htm" title="And you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endures to the end shall be saved.">Matthew 10:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/10-38.htm" title="And he that takes not his cross, and follows after me, is not worthy of me.">Matthew 10:38-39</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="accented">Would</span> for <span class="accented">will</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Yea and all</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>). As though he had said. "Mine is not a solitary example of a servant of God being persecuted; it is the common lot of all who will live godly in Christ Jesus" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-1.htm">1 Peter 4:1, 12, 13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:10-13 The more fully we know the doctrine of Christ, as taught by the apostles, the more closely we shall cleave to it. When we know the afflictions of believers only in part, they tempt us to decline the cause for which they suffer. A form of godliness, a profession of Christian faith without a godly life, often is allowed to pass, while open profession of the truth as it is in Jesus, and resolute attention to the duties of godliness, stir up the scorn and enmity of the world. As good men, by the grace of God, grow better, so bad men, through the craft of Satan, and the power of their own corruptions, grow worse. The way of sin is down-hill; such go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. Those who deceive others, deceive themselves, as they will find at last, to their cost. The history of the outward church, awfully shows that the apostle spake this as he was moved by the Holy Ghost.</body></html>
