The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span> is "to love," used primarily of the natural affection of parents to their children and children to their parents. And <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span> is that natural love. These persons were without this <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span>, of which Plato says, "A child loves his parents, and is loved by them;" and so, according to St. Paul's judgment in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>, were "worse than infidels." <span class="cmt_word">Implacable</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); only here according to the R.T., not at all in the LXX., but frequent in classical Greek. <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;</span> was a solemn truce made over a <span class="accented">libation</span> to the gods. '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> at first merely expresses that anything was done, or any person was left, without such a truce. But, in a secondary sense, applied to a war, it meant an internecine war admitting of no truce; and thence, as here, applied to a person, it means "implacable," one who will make no truce or treaty with his enemy. The sense "truce breakers" is not justified by any example. <span class="cmt_word">Slanderers</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-11.htm">1 Timothy 3:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-3.htm">Titus 2:3</a>.

Used absolutely it means generally "without self-control, as here rendered in the R.V. The A.V. "incontinent" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-5.htm">1 Corinthians 7:5</a>) expresses only one part of the meaning (see <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-25.htm">Matthew 23:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Fierce</span> (from <span class="accented">ferns</span>, wild, savage); <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>; only here in the New Testament, and not found in the LXX., but frequent in the Greek tragedians and others, of persons, countries, plants, etc.; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, "Beware of the Chalubes, for they are savage (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), and cannot be approached by strangers" (AEschylus, 'Prom. Vinct.,' 734, edit. Scholef.). It corresponds with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, unmerciful (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-31.htm">Romans 1:31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">No lovers of good</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); only here in the New Testament, and not at all in the LXX. or in classical Greek. But <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is found in Wisd. 7:22, and in Aristotle, in the sense of "lovers of that which is good;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-8.htm">Titus 1:8</a>. The R.V. seems therefore to be right in rendering here "no lovers of good," rather than as the A.V. "despisers of those which are good," after the Vulgate and the new version of Sanctes Pagninus. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-9 Even in gospel times there would be perilous times; on account of persecution from without, still more on account of corruptions within. Men love to gratify their own lusts, more than to please God and do their duty. When every man is eager for what he can get, and anxious to keep what he has, this makes men dangerous to one another. When men do not fear God, they will not regard man. When children are disobedient to their parents, that makes the times perilous. Men are unholy and without the fear of God, because unthankful for the mercies of God. We abuse God's gifts, if we make them the food and fuel of our lusts. Times are perilous also, when parents are without natural affection to children. And when men have no rule over their own spirits, but despise that which is good and to be honoured. God is to be loved above all; but a carnal mind, full of enmity against him, prefers any thing before him, especially carnal pleasure. A form of godliness is very different from the power; from such as are found to be hypocrites, real Christians must withdraw. Such persons have been found within the outward church, in every place, and at all times. There ever have been artful men, who, by pretences and flatteries, creep into the favour and confidence of those who are too easy of belief, ignorant, and fanciful. All must be ever learning to know the Lord; but these follow every new notion, yet never seek the truth as it is in Jesus. Like the Egyptian magicians, these were men of corrupt minds, prejudiced against the truth, and found to be quite without faith. Yet though the spirit of error may be let loose for a time, Satan can deceive the nations and the churches no further, and no longer, than God will permit.</body></html>
