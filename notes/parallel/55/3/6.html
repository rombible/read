As we shall see, these unhappy men busied themselves in securing popularity among the female portion of the flock in the Ephesian Church, and the way by which they won their popularity was by supplying anodynes for the guilty consciences of these women, laden, we are told, with sins The expression, "which creep into houses," although perfectly natural, and one which, even in these Western countries, could be used with propriety to express the method in which these deceiving and perverting men make their way into households, yet, when we remember the comparative state of seclusion in which women usually lived and still live in Eastern lands, the words used by Paul acquire an increased force. Special fraud and deceit was needful for these false teachers to creep into the women's apartments in Asia. The Greek word translated "lead captive" is a peculiar one, and is only found in comparatively later Greek. It is supposed to be a word of Alexandrian or Macedonian origin. It here represents these women as wholly under the influence of these bad men, to the utter destruction of all true, healthy, home life. The Greek word translated "silly women," in the Vulgate "mulierculas," is simply a diminutive, expressing contempt. There is no doubt but that the older Heresiarchs made great use of women in the propagation of their new and strange systems. They worked more easily, perhaps, on the impulsive and emotional female mind; but what has never sufficiently been taken into account is the reaction which was <span class= "ital">then</span> taking place among women, so long relegated to an inferior and subordinate position, and now, by the teaching of Christ and His Apostles, raised to a position of equality with men as regards the hope of future glory. In many instances, in the first ages of Christianity, there is no doubt, but that they misunderstood their position; they claimed work they could never do, and aimed after an influence they could never exercise, and thus, no doubt, in these first feverish years many a woman fell a comparatively easy prey to these proselytisers, who, laying claim to a higher and deeper wisdom, proposed now to lead some into the knowledge of profound and hidden mysteries, now offered ease of conscience to others if they would but follow them. Irenaeus, in the second century, speaks of the special power which the Valentinian Gnostic Marcus had acquired over women; and Epiphanius, in the same century, also refers to the Gnostics' deceitful influence with the female sex. Jerome, in an interesting though rhetorical passage (<span class= "ital">Epist. ad Ctesiphontem</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>cites a number of instances in which a woman shared in the baleful influence exercised by the leading masters of heresy in doctrine and laxity of life.<p>Simon Magus, he tells us, was accompanied by the wicked Helen. Nicolas, of Antioch, a teacher of immorality, gathered round him what Jerome calls <span class= "ital">choros faemineos.</span> Montanus is associated with the well-known names of Maximilla and Prisca. Donatus is coupled with Lucilla. Marcion, Arius, Priscillian, and other Heresiarchs, famous in the annals of the early churches, he speaks of as intimately associated with or supported by female influence.<p><span class= "bld">Laden with sins, led away with divers lusts.</span>--This gives us some insight into the source of the power which these false teachers acquired over those women of Ephesus who <span class= "ital">in name</span> were Christians. They had accepted the faith of Christ, but were unable to live His life; over their passions and lusts had these no mastery. "Laden with sins," and "led away with divers lusts," these weak women fell an easy prey to men who procured them, by means of their lying doctrines, a false peace. By their words they seemed to have lulled the consciences of their female listeners to sleep. They showed them, no doubt, how in <span class= "ital">their</span> school they might still be Christians and yet indulge their divers lusts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="accented">These</span> for <span class="accented">this sort</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">tact</span> for <span class="accented">which</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">take</span> for <span class="accented">lead</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">by</span> for <span class="accented">with</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Creep into</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); here only in the New Testament.

It occurs in Aristotle and other Greek writers in the sense of heaping one thing upon another, and heaping up anything with something else. The last is the sense in which it is here used.

Men love to gratify their own lusts, more than to please God and do their duty. When every man is eager for what he can get, and anxious to keep what he has, this makes men dangerous to one another. When men do not fear God, they will not regard man. When children are disobedient to their parents, that makes the times perilous. Men are unholy and without the fear of God, because unthankful for the mercies of God. We abuse God's gifts, if we make them the food and fuel of our lusts. Times are perilous also, when parents are without natural affection to children. And when men have no rule over their own spirits, but despise that which is good and to be honoured. God is to be loved above all; but a carnal mind, full of enmity against him, prefers any thing before him, especially carnal pleasure. A form of godliness is very different from the power; from such as are found to be hypocrites, real Christians must withdraw. Such persons have been found within the outward church, in every place, and at all times. There ever have been artful men, who, by pretences and flatteries, creep into the favour and confidence of those who are too easy of belief, ignorant, and fanciful. All must be ever learning to know the Lord; but these follow every new notion, yet never seek the truth as it is in Jesus. Like the Egyptian magicians, these were men of corrupt minds, prejudiced against the truth, and found to be quite without faith. Yet though the spirit of error may be let loose for a time, Satan can deceive the nations and the churches no further, and no longer, than God will permit.</body></html>
