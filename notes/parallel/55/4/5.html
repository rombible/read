The Greek word translated "watch thou," signifies literally, <span class= "ital">be sober.</span> It has been well paraphrased, "Keep thy coolness and presence of mind, that thou be not entrapped into forgetfulness, but as one ever wakeful and ready, be on the watch." The word, as it were, sums up all those last directions of St. Paul, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-14.htm" title="Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.">2Timothy 2:14</a>, in which St. Paul charged Timothy to abstain from vain arguments and confine himself to the simple word of truth, to avoid discussions which would be likely to lead to strife, and to be patient and gentle with all--to separate himself from merely nominal Christians, and to keep steadily to the old paths in which the Apostles had walked. He was to be ever watchful in all these things.<p><span class= "bld">Endure afflictions.</span>--And in his watch must Timothy be ready to suffer. He would remember what had been said before respecting a true Christian suffering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/2-3.htm" title="You therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.">2Timothy 2:3-12</a>), and what was the high reward purposed for such brave endurance. He would remember, too, the hard and faithful life of his master, St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/3-10.htm" title="But you have fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, patience,">2Timothy 3:10-12</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Do the work of an evangelist.</span>--The "evangelists" of the early Church seem to have been preachers of the Gospel: in the first place, assistants to the Apostles and missionaries under their direction. The especial functions of a preacher and public teacher seem always to have been allotted to Timothy, and, no doubt, a peculiar persuasive power of oratory was one of the chief gifts conferred on this eminent follower of St. Paul. In the midst of the many grave and absorbing duties of his charge of the Ephesian Church, he must be mindful not to neglect this great power which he possessed. It is here especially termed "<span class= "ital">the work</span> of an evangelist," to remind him that to perform rightly this duty, needed zeal, close work, much study, thought, and prayer; and it was by worthily performing the duties of an evangelist that the many who were turning from the truth to fables, would be best won back, by hearing the great facts of the Gospel placed side by side with the tables of the false teachers.<p><span class= "bld">Make full proof of thy</span> <span class= "bld">ministry.</span>--In other words, "Fully carry out the many duties imposed upon thee by thy great office." The office of Timothy, it should be remembered, in Ephesus, included far more than merely those of a preacher or evangelist. He was the presiding presbyter of the Church, to whom its government was intrusted: in fact, the many-sided life of St. Paul was now to be lived by Timothy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="accented">Be thou sober</span> for <span class="accented">watch thou</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">suffer hardship</span> for <span class="accented">endure afflictions</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">fulfil</span> for <span class="accented">make full proof of</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Be thou sober</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;</span>); as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-13.htm">1 Peter 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-7.htm">1 Peter 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>.

The phrase is metaphorical, but it is uncertain whether the metaphor is that of a ship borne along by full sails, or of full measure given. If the former is the metaphor, then the derived meaning, when applied to persons, is that of full persuasion, entire and implicit faith, which carries men forward in a bold and unwavering course; or, when applied to things, that of being undoubtedly believed. But if the metaphor is taken from "bringing full measure;" then the sense in the passive voice when applied to persons will be "to be fully satisfied," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to have full assurance, and, when applied to things, "to be fully believed" (Liddell and Scott). Applying the last metaphor to the passage before us, the sense will be "discharge thy ministry to the fall." Let there be no stint of ministerial labour, but carry it out in its completeness, and to the end. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-5 People will turn away from the truth, they will grow weary of the plain gospel of Christ, they will be greedy of fables, and take pleasure in them. People do so when they will not endure that preaching which is searching, plain, and to the purpose. Those who love souls must be ever watchful, must venture and bear all the painful effects of their faithfulness, and take all opportunities of making known the pure gospel.</body></html>
