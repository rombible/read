First, he speaks generally of the combatant, the charioteer, and the runner. "I have fought the good fight," leaving it undetermined what description of strife or contest was referred to. The tense of the Greek verb--the perfect--"I <span class= "ital">have</span> fought," is remarkable. The struggle had been bravely sustained in the past, and was now being equally bravely sustained to the end. His claim to the crown (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-8.htm" title="From now on there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but to all them also that love his appearing.">2Timothy 4:8</a>) was established.<p><span class= "bld">I have finished my course.</span>--Or "race," for here the image of the stadium, the Olympic race-course, was occupying the Apostle's thoughts. Again the perfect is used: "I <span class= "ital">have</span> finished my course." How, asks, Chrysostom, "had he finished his course?" and answers rather rhetorically by replying that he had made the circuit of the world. The question is better answered in St. Paul's own words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-24.htm" title="But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear to myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.">Acts 20:24</a>), where he explains "his course," which he would finish with joy, as the ministry which he had received of the Lord Jesus.<p><span class= "bld">I have kept the faith.</span>--Here, again, the metaphor is changed, and St. Paul looks back on his lived life as on one long, painful struggle to guard the treasure of the Catholic faith inviolate and untarnished (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-20.htm" title="O Timothy, keep that which is committed to your trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:">1Timothy 6:20</a>). And now the struggle was over, and he handed on the sacred deposit, safe. It is well to compare this passage with the words of the same Apostle in the Epistle to the Philippians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-12.htm" title="Yes, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.">2Timothy 3:12</a>, and following verses). The same metaphors were in the Apostle's mind on both occasions; but in the first instance (in the Philippian Epistle) they were used by the anxious, care worn servant of the Lord, hoping and, at the same time, fearing what the future had in store for him and his Church; in the second (in the Epistle to Timothy) they were the expression of the triumphant conviction of the dying follower of Christ, who had so followed his loved Master in life, that he now shrank not from following the same Master in death.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> for <span class="accented">a</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the</span> for <span class="accented">my</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">I have fought the good fight</span>; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-12.htm">1 Timothy 6:12</a> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>), meaning that, however honourable the contests of the games were deemed, the Christian contest was far more honourable than them all. The word "fight" does not adequately express by agora, which embraces all kinds of contests - chariot race, foot race, wrestling, etc. "I have played out the honourable game" would give the sense, though inelegantly. <span class="cmt_word">The course</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-25.htm">Acts 13:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-24.htm">Acts 20:24</a>. The runner in the race had a definite <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or course to run, marked out for him. St. Paul's life was that course, and he knew that he had run it out. <span class="cmt_word">I have kept the faith.</span> St. Paul here quits metaphor and explains the foregoing figures. Through his long eventful course, in spite of all difficulties, conflicts, dangers, and temptations, he had kept the faith of Jesus Christ committed to him, inviolable, unadulterated, whole, and complete. He had not shrunk from confessing it when death stared him in the face; he had not corrupted it to meet the views of Jews or Gentiles; with courage and resolution and perseverance he had kept it to the end. Oh! let Timothy do the same. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:6-8 The blood of the martyrs, though not a sacrifice of atonement, yet was a sacrifice of acknowledgment to the grace of God and his truth. Death to a good man, is his release from the imprisonment of this world, and his departure to the enjoyments of another world. As a Christian, and a minister, Paul had kept the faith, kept the doctrines of the gospel. What comfort will it afford, to be able to speak in this manner toward the end of our days! The crown of believers is a crown of righteousness, purchased by the righteousness of Christ. Believers have it not at present, yet it is sure, for it is laid up for them. The believer, amidst poverty, pain, sickness, and the agonies of death, may rejoice; but if the duties of a man's place and station are neglected, his evidence of interest in Christ will be darkened, and uncertainty and distress may be expected to cloud and harass his last hours.</body></html>
