The date of his consecration corresponds with the year of St. Paul's martyrdom, A.D. 66. We know, from this greeting, he was one of the few "faithful" to his old master.<p>It is, perhaps, fair to assume, though of course there is no certainty of this, that the consecration of Linus to the government of the Roman Church as its first Bishop was one of the dying acts done by the Apostle Paul.<p>Some commentators identify the other two with "Pudens and Claudia" mentioned by Martial (<span class= "ital">Epigrams, </span>iv. 13; xi. 54). Pudens was the son of a Roman senator; to Claudia, Martial gives the name of Rufina, and states she was a Briton. The dates of the Epigrams in question would agree with the identification.

St. Paul's longing to have Timothy with him is apparent throughout. <span class="cmt_word">Eubulus</span>; mentioned nowhere else. The name is not uncommon as a Greek name, and appears also in the patronymic <span class="accented">Eubulides</span>, and the female name <span class="accented">Eubule. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia.</span> Of these persons <span class="accented">Linus</span> is probably the same as is mentioned by Irenaeus and Eusebius as the first Bishop of Rome. Irenaeus (3:111, 3) says, "When the apostles, therefore, had founded the Church (of Rome) they entrusted the office (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) of the episcopate to Linus, of whom Paul makes mention in his Epistles to Timothy." Eusebius ('Ecc. Hist.,' 3:2) says, "Linus was ordained the first Bishop of Rome (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>) after the martyrdom of Paul and Peter" (see, too, &sect; 4 of the same book). Some identify him with a certain Llin in Welsh hagiography, said to be the son of Caractacus. As regards <span class="accented">Pudens</span> and <span class="accented">Claudia</span>, nothing is known about them unless the very ingenious and interesting theory of Archdeacon Williams is true, which is necessarily very uncertain. According to this theory, Claudia is the <span class="accented">foreign</span> lady, a <span class="accented">Briton</span>, whose marriage with Pudens is spoken of by Martial in two epigrams, and who also bore the cognomen of <span class="accented">Rufina.</span> It is supposed that she was the daughter of the British king Cogidubnus, the ally of the Romans and of the Roman governor, Aulus Plautius, whose wife Pomponia is said by Tacitus to have been impeached of the crime of embracing a "foreign superstition," which was probably Christianity. Cogidubnus appears by an ancient inscription now at Goodwood to have taken the name of the Emperor Claudius, being called Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus, which would naturally lead to his daughter being called Claudia. And if further she was adopted by the wife of her father's ally, the name Rufina would be accounted for, as a distinguished branch of the gens Pomponia bore the name of Rufus. And Martial's epigram is addressed to "Rufus," as one interested in the marriage. Claudia may either have learnt Christianity from Pomponia, or may have conveyed the knowledge of the gospel to her. On the other hand, the name of <span class="accented">Pudens</span> appears on the Goodwood inscription as having given, while still a heathen, a site for a temple of Neptune and Minerva, which was built "pro salute" of the imperial family under the authority of King Cogidubnus - curiously connecting him with the British king. It is probable that Pudens and Claudia were not yet married. Thus it will be seen that, while this theory is borne out by many coincidences, it cannot by any means be adopted as certain (see Dean Alford's <span class="accented">excussus</span> in the 'Proleg. to 2 Timothy;' and Conybeare and Howson's 'Life of St. Paul,' vol. it. p. 501). Lewin ('Life and Epist. of St. Paul,' vol. 2, p. 392) warmly espouses the theory, but hesitates between Caractacus and Cogidubnus as the father of Claudia. Farrar rejects the whole theory "as an elaborate rope of sand" ('Life of St. Paul,' vol. 2, p. 569). If Linus was the son, and Claudia the daughter, of Caractacus, they would be brother and sister. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:19-22 We need no more to make us happy, than to have the Lord Jesus Christ with our spirits; for in him all spiritual blessings are summed up. It is the best prayer we can offer for our friends, that the Lord Jesus Christ may be with their spirits, to sanctify and save them, and at last to receive them to himself. Many who believed as Paul, are now before the throne, giving glory to their Lord: may we be followers of them.</body></html>
