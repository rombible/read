That he had been at Rome, and had given evidence against St. Paul, and had argued against the defence of the Apostle, is probable. "Our words" some understand as especially referring to St. Paul's defence before the imperial tribunal. If we identify him with the Alexander of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/19-33.htm" title="And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defense to the people.">Acts 19:33-34</a>, then he was a Jew, one of those bitter, life-long antagonists of the Gentile Apostle who crossed his path at every step, and not improbably brought about, in the end, his death. It is an interesting suggestion which refers the connection between St. Paul and Alexander back to those days when Saul and Alexander were both reckoned as belonging to the strictest Pharisee party, determined foes to the "Nazarenes." Saul--if we adopt this supposition--became the Apostle St. Paul of the Gentiles; Alexander remained a fanatic Jew--hence the enmity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="accented">Withstood</span> for <span class="accented">hath withstood</span>, A.V. Of whom be thou ware (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). This is the proper construction in classical Greek, the accusative of the person or thing, after <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. But it is only found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-25.htm">Acts 21:25</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15</a> the equally correct phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, is used. The inference from this caution to Timothy is that Alexander had left Rome and returned to his native Ephesus. The Jews were always on the move. <span class="cmt_word">He greatly withstood our words</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>). For an exactly similar use, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-8.htm">Acts 13:8</a>, where Elymas "withstood" Paul and Barnabas; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-8.htm">2 Timothy 3:8</a>, where Jannes and Jambres "withstood" Moses. In this case we may be sure that Paul, in pleading for his life, did not omit to preach the gospel to his Gentile audience. Alexander tried to refute his words, not without effect. The apostle says "<span class="accented">our</span> words" (not "<span class="accented">my</span> words"), perhaps to associate with himself those other Christians who were with him. It certainly cannot mean "yours and mine," as Timothy was not with him when the "words" were spoken. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:14-18 There is as much danger from false brethren, as from open enemies. It is dangerous having to do with those who would be enemies to such a man as Paul. The Christians at Rome were forward to meet him, Ac 28, but when there seemed to be a danger of suffering with him, then all forsook him. God might justly be angry with them, but he prays God to forgive them. The apostle was delivered out of the mouth of the lion, that is, of Nero, or some of his judges. If the Lord stands by us, he will strengthen us in difficulties and dangers, and his presence will more than supply every one's absence.</body></html>
