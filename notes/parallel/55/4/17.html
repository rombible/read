The strength and courage which the <span class= "ital">felt</span> presence of his Lord gave him, enabled him on that occasion, when alone, friendless, accused of a hateful crime before the highest earthly tribunal in the capital city of the world, to plead not only for himself but for that great cause with which he was identified. He spoke possibly for the last time publicly [we know nothing of the final trial, when he was condemned] the glad tidings of which he was the chosen herald to the Gentile world. It is probable that this great trial took place in the Forum, in one of the Pauline Basilicas--so called after L. 'milius Paulus. It is certain it was in the presence of a crowded audience. St. Paul evidently intimates this when he tells us how he spoke "that all the Gentiles might hear." This was apparently the culminating point of St. Paul's labours--the last stone of the laborious edifice of his life's work. Had the courage of the Apostle of the Gentiles failed him on this most momentous occasion, the spirit of the sorely-tried Church of Rome had surely sunk, and that marvellous and rapid progress of the gospel in the West--which, in a little more than a hundred years, would make its influence felt in well-nigh every city and village of the empire--had been arrested.<p><span class= "bld">And that all the Gentiles might hear.</span>--Here alluding primarily to the crowded audience which had listened on this solemn occasion to St. Paul's <span class= "ital">Apologia pro Christo; </span>but there is another and deeper reference to those uncounted peoples in the isles of the Gentiles, who, by St. Paul's work and words, would come to the saving knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus.<p><span class= "bld">And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</span>--Expositors have, in all ages, dwelt much on the question, "Who was to be understood under the figure of the lion?" The fathers mostly believe the Emperor Nero was here alluded to. Others have suggested that St. Paul was referring to the "lions" of the amphitheatre, from whom, at all events for the time, he had been delivered. It is, however, best to understand the expression as a figurative expression for extreme danger. His Master on that dread occasion stood by him, and gave him strength and wisdom over man to speak the words of life, and delivered him for the moment out of the imminent peril threatening him, allowing him, not only to speak his Master's words there, but also thus to write this solemn farewell charge to Timothy and the Church. That such figurative language was not unusual, compare the <span class= "ital">Epistle of Ignatius to the Romans, </span>iii.:8, in which writing the prisoner describes his journey from Syria to Rome as one long "fight with wild beasts," and speaks of himself as "bound to ten leopards," thus designating his soldier guards.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="accented">But</span> for <span class="accented">notwithstanding</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">by</span> for <span class="accented">with</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">through</span> for <span class="accented">by</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">message</span> for <span class="accented">preaching</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">proclaimed</span> for <span class="accented">known</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Stood by me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>); as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-2.htm">Romans 16:2</a> (where see also the use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, a helper). <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means simply to stand by the side of a person - to be present. But, like <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, it acquires the meaning of standing by for the purpose of helping. The contrast between the timid faithless friends who failed him like a deceitful brook (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15</a>), and the faithfulness of the Lord who was a very present Help in trouble, is very striking. Strengthened me (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-12.htm">1 Timothy 1:12</a>, note, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-8.htm">Acts 6:8</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The message</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). The A.V. <span class="accented">preaching</span> is far better. St. Paul means that gospel which he was commissioned to preach, and which he did preach openly in full court when he was on his trial (see ver. 15, note). <span class="cmt_word">Might be fully proclaimed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>, note; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-19.htm">Romans 15:19</a>. <span class="cmt_word">All the Gentiles might hear</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12-14</a>). The brave, unselfish spirit of the apostle thinking more of the proclamation of the gospel than of his own life, is truly admirable. <span class="cmt_word">I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</span> Surely there can be no doubt that, as Bengel says, this is a quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-20.htm">Psalm 22:20, 21</a>. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, "I was delivered," comes from the twentieth verse, "Deliver my soul from the sword," and the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, is found <span class="accented">verbatim</span> in ver. 21. The apostle means his deliverance from the executioner's sword. In the next verse we find both the words <span class="greek">&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, and the whole tone of the psalm breathes the same spirit as the saying, "The Lord stood by me." Dean Alford's suggestion that the lion here is Satan, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, and the danger which the apostle escaped was not death, which he did not fear, but betraying the gospel under the fear of death, is ingenious, but rather far fetched, though not impossible. It may possibly have been part of what was in St. Paul's mind. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:14-18 There is as much danger from false brethren, as from open enemies. It is dangerous having to do with those who would be enemies to such a man as Paul. The Christians at Rome were forward to meet him, Ac 28, but when there seemed to be a danger of suffering with him, then all forsook him. God might justly be angry with them, but he prays God to forgive them. The apostle was delivered out of the mouth of the lion, that is, of Nero, or some of his judges. If the Lord stands by us, he will strengthen us in difficulties and dangers, and his presence will more than supply every one's absence.</body></html>
