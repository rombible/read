(<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/19-33.htm" title="And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defense to the people.">Acts 19:33-34</a>).<p>It has been suggested that this Alexander, an influential Ephesian Jew, had done much injury to the cause of the Christians generally, and to St. Paul personally, with the imperial authorities at Rome.<p><span class= "bld">The Lord reward him according to his works.</span>--The older authorities read, "shall reward him . . ." The works referred to were the bitter injuries he had done to the cause of Christ, rather than to the Apostle himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="accented">Will render to him</span> for <span class="accented">reward him</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Alexander</span>; apparently an Ephesian, as appears by the words, "of whom be thou ware also." It seems probable, though it is necessarily uncertain, that this Alexander is the same person as that mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a> as "a blasphemer," which agrees exactly with what is here said of him, "he greatly withstood our words" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-45.htm">Acts 13:45</a>, "contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed"). He may or may not be the same as the Alexander named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-33.htm">Acts 19:33</a>. Supposing the Alexander of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a> and this place to be the same, the points of resemblance with the Alexander of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-33.htm">Acts 19:33</a> are that both resided at Ephesus, that both seem to have been Christians (see note on 1 Timothy 1:20), and both probably Jews, inasmuch as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1.htm">1 Timothy 1</a> relates entirely to Jewish heresies (vers. 4, 7, 8), and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-33.htm">Acts 19:33</a> expressly states that he was a Jew. <span class="cmt_word">The coppersmith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>; only here in the New Testament); properly, <span class="accented">a coppersmith</span>, but used generally of any smith - silversmith, or goldsmith, or blacksmith. <span class="cmt_word">Did me much evil</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). This is a purely Hellenistic idiom, and is found in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-15.htm">Genesis 50:15, 17</a>; Song of the Three Children, 19; 2 Macc. 13:9. In classical Greek the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, in the middle voice, "to display," can only be followed by a subjective quality, as "good will," "virtue," "long suffering," an "opinion," and the like (see Alford, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). And so it is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-16.htm">1 Timothy 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-10.htm">Titus 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-2.htm">Titus 3:2</a>. The question naturally arises - When and where did Alexander thus injure St. Paul? - at Ephesus or at Rome? Bengel suggests Rome, and with great probability. Perhaps he did him evil by stirring up the Jews at Rome against the apostle at the time of "his first defence;" or by giving adverse testimony before the Roman tribunal, possibly accusing him of being seditious, and bringing up the riot at Ephesus as a proof of it; or in some other way, of which the memory has perished. <span class="cmt_word">Will render.</span> The R.T. has the future, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> for the optative <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b7;</span>, "a late and incorrect form for <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;</span> (Ellicott, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:14-18 There is as much danger from false brethren, as from open enemies. It is dangerous having to do with those who would be enemies to such a man as Paul. The Christians at Rome were forward to meet him, Ac 28, but when there seemed to be a danger of suffering with him, then all forsook him. God might justly be angry with them, but he prays God to forgive them. The apostle was delivered out of the mouth of the lion, that is, of Nero, or some of his judges. If the Lord stands by us, he will strengthen us in difficulties and dangers, and his presence will more than supply every one's absence.</body></html>
