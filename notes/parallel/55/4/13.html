To explain this seemingly strange request, some have wished to understand by "the cloke" some garment St. Paul was in the habit of wearing when performing certain sacred functions: in other words, as a vestment; but such a supposition would be in the highest degree precarious, for nowhere in the New Testament is the slightest hint given us that any such vestment was ever used in the primitive Christian Church. It is much better to understand the words as simply requesting Timothy, on his way, to bring with him a thick cloak, or mantle, which St. Paul had left with a certain Carpus at Troas. Probably, when he left it, it was summer, and he was disinclined to burden himself in his hurried journey with any superfluous things. Winter was now coming on, and the poor aged prisoner in the cold damp prison, with few friends and scant resources, remembered and wished for his cloak. It is just such a request which the master would make of his disciple, who, knowing well the old man's frail, shattered health, would never be surprised at such a request even in an Epistle so solemn. Then too St. Paul, by his very wish here expressed, to see Timothy, as above discussed, hopes against hope that still a little while for work in the coming winter months was still before him, though he felt death was for him very near; no forger of the Epistle had dreamed of putting down such a request.<p><span class= "bld">And the books.</span>--The books were, most likely, a few choice works, some bearing on Jewish sacred history, partly exegetical and explanatory of the mysterious senses veiled under the letter of the law and the prophets, and partly historical. Others were probably heathen writings, of which we know, from his many references in his Epistles, St. Paul was a diligent student. These few choice books, it has been suggested, with high probability, St. Paul "had made a shift to get and preserve," and these, if God spared his life yet a few short months, he would have with him for reference in his prison room.<p><span class= "bld">But especially the parchments.</span>--These precious papers, above all, would St. Paul have with him. These were, most likely, common-place books, in which the Apostle--evidently always a diligent student--had written what he had observed as worthy of especial notice in the reading of either of the Scriptures of the Old Testament, or the other books bearing on Jewish or Pagan literature and history. These precious notes were probably the result of many years' reading and study. He would have them with him as long as life remained to him. (Compare on this strange but interesting verse Bp. Bull's learned and exhaustive sermon: <span class= "ital">Works, </span>vol. i. p. 240, Oxford Edition, 1846.) Erasmus remarks on this request of St. Paul: "Behold the Apostle's goods or movables: a poor cloke to keep him from the weather, and a few books!"<p>A suggestion has been made that the words translated "Much learning doth make thee mad" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-24.htm" title="And as he thus spoke for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you are beside yourself; much learning does make you mad.">Acts 26:24</a>) should be rendered, <span class= "ital">Thy many rolls of parchment are turning thy brain, </span>and that these rolls of parchment referred to by Festus as the companions of St. Paul's captivity at Caesarea were identical with those parchments left with Carpus. The Greek words, however, are not the same in the two passages. Of this Carpus nothing is known.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="accented">Bring when thou comest</span> for <span class="accented">when thou comest bring with thee</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">especially</span> for <span class="accented">but especially</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The cloke</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, more properly written <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>); the Latin <span class="accented">paenula</span>, the thick overcoat or cloke. Only here in the New Testament. Some think it was the bag in which the books and parchments were packed. <span class="cmt_word">The parchments</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). This, again, is a Latin word. It occurs only here in the New Testament. They would probably be for the apostle to write his Epistles on. Or they may have been valuable manuscripts of some kind. In ver. 20 we learn that St. Paul had lately been at Miletus; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a> that he was then going to Macedonia. Tress would be on his way to Macedonia, Greece, and Rome (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-8.htm">Acts 16:8, 9, 11</a>), as it was on the return journey from Macedonia to Miletus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-5.htm">Acts 20:5, 15</a>). It should further be observed that the journey here indicated is the same as that referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>, which confirms the inevitable inference from this chapter that St. Paul, on his way to Rome from Miletus, whither he had come from Crete (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a>), passed through Tress, Macedonia, and Corinth (ver. 20), leaving Timothy at Ephesus. (See Introduction.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:9-13 The love of this world, is often the cause of turning back from the truths and ways of Jesus Christ. Paul was guided by Divine inspiration, yet he would have his books. As long as we live, we must still learn. The apostles did not neglect human means, in seeking the necessaries of life, or their own instruction. Let us thank the Divine goodness in having given us so many writings of wise and pious men in all ages; and let us seek that by reading them our profiting may appear to all.</body></html>
