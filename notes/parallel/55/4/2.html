St. Paul charged his friend and successor with awful solemnity, as we have seen, "preach," or proclaim. loudly and publicly, as a herald would announce the accession of his king. The exact opposite to what St. Paul would urge on Timothy is described by Isa. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-10.htm" title="His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.">Isaiah 56:10</a>), when he speaks of God's watchmen as "dumb dogs, who cannot bark, sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber."<p><span class= "bld">Be instant in season, out of season.</span>--Some difference exists between commentators respecting the exact meaning to be given to the Greek word translated "be instant." Some would give it the sense of drawing nigh to, and as it is not specified in the text to whom Timothy should draw nigh, they supply from the context "the brethren," those to whom the word is preached: "draw near to Christian assemblies." It seems, however, best to understand this rather difficult word as an injunction to Timothy to be earnest and urgent generally in the whole work of his ministry: "Press on, in season, out of season."<p><span class= "bld">In season, out of season.</span>--In other words, "For thy work, set apart no definite and fixed hours, no appointed times. Thy work must be done at all hours, at all times. Thy work has to be done not only when thou art in church, not merely in times of security and peace, but it must be carried on, in the midst of dangers, even if thou art a prisoner and in chains, even if death threaten thee."<p>So Chrysostom--who also uses St. Paul's words here as an urgent call to ministers to labour on in spite of discouragement and apparent failure--telling them in his own bright, eloquent way, how fountains still flow on, though no one goes to them to draw water, and rivers still run on, though no one drinks at them.<p>Augustine asks and answers the question to whom "in season" and to whom "out of season" refers: "in season" to those willing, "out of season" to the unwilling. This, however, only touches a portion of the thought of St. Paul, who urges on God's true servants a restless, sleepless earnestness, which struggles on with the Master's work in spite of bodily weakness and discouragement, in face of dangers and the bitterest opposition.<p><span class= "bld">Reprove.</span>--Not merely those erring in doctrine, but generally those who are blameworthy: "Was tadelnswerthist."<p><span class= "bld">Rebuke.</span>--A sharper and more severe word than the preceding. It is used by St. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-9.htm" title="Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke you.">Jude 1:9</a>, in his report of the words addressed by St. Michael to the devil: "The Lord rebuke thee." It frequently occurs in the Gospels. (See, for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-18.htm" title="And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.">Matthew 17:18</a>, "And Jesus rebuked the devil.")<p><span class= "bld">Exhort.</span>--Not only is he to remember ceaselessly to watch over the flock, and to reprove and rebuke the erring and sinners, but also with no less diligence to speak comfortable words of encouragement and hope to all, especially the dispirited and sad-hearted.<p><span class= "bld">With all longsuffering and doctrine.</span>--The word translated "doctrine" signifies, rather, <span class= "ital">teaching.</span> He must reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all gentleness and patience; and in all this he must take care that "teaching"--the teaching which is right, and true, and full of hope--accompanies his rebuke and his words of comfort.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="accented">Teaching</span> for <span class="accented">doctrine</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Preach the Word</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). It is impossible to exaggerate the dignity and importance here given to preaching by its being made the subject of so solemn and awful an adjuration as that in ver. 1 (compare the designation of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;</span> which St. Paul gives to himself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-7.htm">1 Timothy 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-11.htm">2 Timothy 1:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Be instant</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;</span>). The force of the exhortation must be found, not in the verb itself taken alone, but by coupling <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> closely with it. Be at your work, attend to it always, in and out of season; let nothing stop you; be always ready, always at hand. <span class="cmt_word">Reprove</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>, note (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-20.htm">1 Timothy 5:20</a>). Generally with the idea of bringing the fault home to the offender. <span class="cmt_word">Rebuke</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); a stronger word than <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, implying more of authority and less of argument (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-26.htm">Matthew 8:26</a>: 17:18; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-39.htm">Luke 19:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a>, etc.). Exhort (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). Sometimes the sense of "exhort," and sometimes that of "comfort," predominates (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-1.htm">1 Timothy 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-2.htm">1 Timothy 6:2</a>, etc.). Every way of strengthening and establishing souls in the fear and love of God is to be tried, and that <span class="cmt_word">with all long suffering and teaching.</span> (For <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, see ch. 3:10, note.) For "teaching" or "doctrine" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>), St. Paul more frequently uses <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in the pastoral Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-10.htm">1 Timothy 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-6.htm">1 Timothy 4:6, 13, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>; ch. 3:10, 16, etc.); but there does not seem to be any great difference of meaning. Possibly <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> points more to the act of teaching. The use of it here, coupled with "long suffering," directs that the man of God, whether he preaches, reproves, rebukes, or exhorts, is always to be a patient teacher of God's Word and truth. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-5 People will turn away from the truth, they will grow weary of the plain gospel of Christ, they will be greedy of fables, and take pleasure in them. People do so when they will not endure that preaching which is searching, plain, and to the purpose. Those who love souls must be ever watchful, must venture and bear all the painful effects of their faithfulness, and take all opportunities of making known the pure gospel.</body></html>
