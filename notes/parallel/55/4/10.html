The tradition, however, which relates that he became in after days an idol priest at Thessalonica is baseless. Demas is a shorter form, probably, for the well-known and now common Grecian name of Demetrius.<p>The present world (<span class= "ital">ai?na</span>)<span class= "ital">:</span> that is, the present (evil) course of things.<p><span class= "bld">Is departed unto Thessalonica.</span>--From Chrysostom's words above quoted, Thessalonica was apparently the "home" of Demas. It has been supposed, however, by some, that Thessalonica was chosen by Demas as his abode when he left St. Paul because it was a great mercantile centre, and his business connections were there, and he preferred them, the rich and prosperous friends, to St. Paul, the condemned and dying prisoner. Thessalonica was, at this time, one of the great cities of the empire. It was the most populous of the Macedonian cities, and had been chosen to be the metropolis of that great province. Before the founding of Constantinople, it was evidently the capital of Greece and Illyricum, as well as of Macedonia. It was famous throughout the Middle Ages, and is celebrated by the early German poets under the abbreviated name of "Salneck," which as become the Saloniki of the Levant of our days. It is singular that the name of its patron saint, "Demetrius," martyred about A.D. 290 (identified above with Demas), whose local glory (comp. Conybeare and Howson's <span class= "ital">St. Paul, </span>chap. 9) has even eclipsed that of St. Paul, the founder of the Church, should be identical with that of the "forsaker" of St. Paul.<p><span class= "bld">Crescens to Galatia.</span>--Nothing is known of this friend of St. Paul. One tradition speaks of him as a preacher in Galatia, and another of his having founded the Church of Vienne in Gaul. There is a curious variation in some of the older authorities here, "Gallia" being read instead of Galatia. Whether Crescens, on his leaving St. Paul, went to Galatia or Gaul is, therefore, uncertain.<p><span class= "bld">Titus unto Dalmatia.</span>--Dalmatia was a province of Roman Illyricum, lying along the Adriatic. Nothing is known respecting this journey of Titus. It was, most probably, made with the Apostle's sanction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="accented">Forsook</span> for <span class="accented">hath forsaken</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">went</span> for <span class="accented">is departed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">to</span> for <span class="accented">unto</span>, A.V. (twice). <span class="cmt_word">Demas</span>. Nothing more is known of Demas than what is gathered from the mention of him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-14.htm">Colossians 4:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-1.htm">Philemon 1:1:24</a>. We learn from those passages that he was a fellow labourer of the apostle, and it is remarkable that in them both he is coupled, as here, with Luke and Mark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>). (See Introduction.) <span class="cmt_word">Having loved this present world.</span> It would appear from this that Demas had not the faith or the courage to run the risk of sharing St. Paul's imminent martyrdom at Rome, but left him, while he was free to do so, under pretence of an urgent call to Thessaloniea; just as Mark left Paul and Barnabas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-13.htm">Acts 13:13</a>). But there is no ground to believe that he was an apostate from the faith. The coupling together of Demas and Aristarchus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a> suggests that Demas may have been a Thessalonian, as we know that Aristarchus was (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>). <span class="accented">Demas</span> is thought to be a shortened form of <span class="accented">Demarchus.</span> If so, we have a slight additional indication of his being a Thessalonian, as compounds with <span class="accented">archos</span> or <span class="accented">arches</span> would seem to have been common in Thessalonica (compare <span class="accented">Aristarchus</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-6.htm">Acts 17:6, 8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Crescens</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>); only mentioned here. It is a Latin name, like <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">Pudens</span>, in ver. 21. There was a cynic philosopher of this name in the second century, a great enemy of the Christians. The tradition ('Apost. Constit.,' 7:46) that he preached the gospel in Galatia is probably derived from this passage. Titus, etc. The last mention of Titus, not reckoning the Epistle to Titus, is that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-18.htm">2 Corinthians 12:18</a>, from which it appears that St. Paul had sent him to Corinth just before his own last visit to that city. How the interval was filled up, and where Titus passed the time, we know not. He is not once named in the Acts of the Apostles, nor in any of St. Paul's Epistles written during his first imprisonment. But we gather from <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a> that he accompanied St. Paul to Crete, presumably after the apostle's return from Spain; that he was left there for a time to organize the Church; that later he joined the apostle at Nicopolis (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>),and, doubtless by St. Paul's desire, went to Dalmatia, as mentioned in this tenth verse. And here our knowledge of him ends. Tradition pretty consistently makes him Bishop of Gortyna, in Crete, where are the ruins of a very ancient church dedicated to St. Titus, in which service is occasionally performed by priests from the neighbourhood (Dean Howson, in 'Dict. of Bible:' art. "Titus"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:9-13 The love of this world, is often the cause of turning back from the truths and ways of Jesus Christ. Paul was guided by Divine inspiration, yet he would have his books. As long as we live, we must still learn. The apostles did not neglect human means, in seeking the necessaries of life, or their own instruction. Let us thank the Divine goodness in having given us so many writings of wise and pious men in all ages; and let us seek that by reading them our profiting may appear to all.</body></html>
