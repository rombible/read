In his first imprisonment at Rome St. Paul looked on to a martyr's death as probable. In his second captivity at Rome he writes of the martyrdom as already beginning. The more accurate, as well as the more forcible, translation would be, <span class= "ital">For I am already being offered.</span> The Greek word rendered "I am being offered," points to the drink offering of wine which, among the Jews, accompanied the sacrifice. Among the heathen this wine was commonly poured upon the burning victims--the allusion here is to St. Paul's bloody death. So convinced was he that the dread moment for him was at hand, that as he thus speaks he feels as though it was even then taking place, and sees--in his present suffering, in his harsh treatment--the beginning of that martyrdom in which his life-blood would be poured out. But he would not allow Timothy or the many Christians who revered and loved him to be dismayed by his sufferings or shocked at his painful death. He would show them, by his calm, triumphant language, that to him death was no terror, but only the appointed passage to glory. So he speaks of his life-blood being shed, under the well-known peaceful image of the wine poured out over the sacrifice, the drink offering, the sweet savour unto the Lord. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/15-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Numbers 15:1-10</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it stays alone: but if it die, it brings forth much fruit.">John 12:24</a>, where the Master of St. Paul, too, speaks of His approaching death of agony and shame also under a quiet, homely image.)<p><span class= "bld">And the time of my departure is at hand.</span>--"My departure:" that is. "from life," from this world to another. The moment of my death, so long looked for, is now close at hand, is all but here. The Greek word rendered "departure," among other meanings, signifies the raising of the ship's anchor and the loosing of the cables by which the vessel was hindered from proceeding on her destined voyage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="accented">Already being offered</span> for <span class="accented">now ready to be offered</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">come</span> for <span class="accented">at hand.</span> A.V. <span class="cmt_word">I am already being offered.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;</span> is emphatic, in contrast with the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;</span> of ver. 5: "Thou, who hast still life before thee, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry. I can do so no longer, for my martyrdom has already commenced, and my end is close at hand. Thou must take my place in the great conflict." <span class="accented">Am</span>... <span class="accented">being offered</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">am being poured out</span>, as the drink offering, or libation, is poured out. St. Paul uses the same figure in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>, where he couples it with the sacrifice and service (or offering up) of the faith of the Philippians by himself as the priest, and looks upon the pouring out of his own life as the completion of that sacrifice (see Ellicott on Philippians). "The libation always formed the conclusion of the sacrifice, and so the apostle's martyrdom closed his apostolic service" (Huther), which had been a continual sacrifice, in which he had been the ministering priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16</a>). So that the use of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> here exactly agrees with that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>. "My sacrificial work," St. Paul says," being now finished and ended, I am performing the last solemn act, the pouring out of my own life in martyrdom, to which I shall pass out of the prison where I now am." <span class="cmt_word">The time of my departure</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>). The word is found nowhere else in the New Testament, but St. Paul uses the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to depart," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>, where, the verb being in the active voice, the metaphor clearly is from weighing anchor, as in common use in classical Greek; hence simply "to depart." The classical use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> rather favours the sense, either of" release" or of " dissolution." But St. Paul's use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>, and the frequent use of the same verb in the LXX. and by Josephus, in the sense of "to depart," favours the rendering of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> by "departure," as in the A.V. and R.V. <span class="cmt_word">Is come;</span> rather, <span class="accented">is at hand</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>); the same verb as <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;</span> in ver. 2. (On the difference between <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> ("is come") and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> ("is at hand"), see Alford on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-20.htm">Acts 22:20</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:6-8 The blood of the martyrs, though not a sacrifice of atonement, yet was a sacrifice of acknowledgment to the grace of God and his truth. Death to a good man, is his release from the imprisonment of this world, and his departure to the enjoyments of another world. As a Christian, and a minister, Paul had kept the faith, kept the doctrines of the gospel. What comfort will it afford, to be able to speak in this manner toward the end of our days! The crown of believers is a crown of righteousness, purchased by the righteousness of Christ. Believers have it not at present, yet it is sure, for it is laid up for them. The believer, amidst poverty, pain, sickness, and the agonies of death, may rejoice; but if the duties of a man's place and station are neglected, his evidence of interest in Christ will be darkened, and uncertainty and distress may be expected to cloud and harass his last hours.</body></html>
