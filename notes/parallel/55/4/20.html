Erastus the chamberlain of the city salutes you, and Quartus a brother.">Romans 16:23</a>, the "chamberlain" of Corinth, one of the Christian congregation of that city. This man was probably identical with him.<p>Another "Eastus" appears among those who ministered to St. Paul at Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-22.htm" title="So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered to him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.">Acts 19:22</a>). Him St. Paul sent on missionary work into Macedonia. There were, therefore, among St. Paul's friends two men of this name: the one a resident official personage at Corinth; the other one of that band who journeyed hither and thither for the propagation of the faith.<p><span class= "bld">But Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.</span>--Trophimus, a Gentile Christian, who was with St. Paul on his third missionary journey, and whom the Apostle was accused of taking into the Temple at Jerusalem. It was this accusation on the part of the Jews which led to St. Paul's arrest which preceded his first long imprisonment. The event here alluded to must have taken place some time <span class= "ital">after</span> the Apostle's release from the first imprisonment, A.D. 63, and, probably, in the course of his last journey, shortly before his second arrest and imprisonment at Rome, about A.D. 66.<p><span class= "ital">Miletus</span> (not "Miletum"), a seaport of Caria, about thirty miles from Ephesus, once a city of great renown, whence, it is said, eighty colonies had proceeded; but in the days of St. Paul its glories were already on the wane. It is now famous only for its vast ruined theatre. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-15.htm" title="And we sailed there, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus.">Acts 20:15</a>.)<p>It has been suggested that this mention of Trophimus was intended to clear him of any neglect.

The mention of him here clearly indicates that St. Paul had gone from Troas, where he left his cloke, to Corinth on his way to Rome. <span class="cmt_word">Trophimus</span> is first mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>, where we learn that he was an Asiatic, and more definitely in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-29.htm">Acts 21:29</a>, that he was an Ephesian. He had travelled with St. Paul's party from Macedonia to Troas, and thence to Miletus and Jerusalem, where we lose sight of him till we find him again in this passage journeying towards Rome with St. Paul and others, but stopped at Miletus by sickness. <span class="accented">Miletus</span>, not <span class="accented">Miletum</span>, is the correct form. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:19-22 We need no more to make us happy, than to have the Lord Jesus Christ with our spirits; for in him all spiritual blessings are summed up.

Many who believed as Paul, are now before the throne, giving glory to their Lord: may we be followers of them.</body></html>
