In the whole Epistle there is not one note of fear--nothing which should lead us to suspect that the martyr Apostle was fearful for himself. It reads--does this last letter of the great Gentile teacher--in many places like a triumphant song of death. It, therefore, appears unnatural to introduce into the closing words of the Epistle the thought of the Lord's help in the event of the Apostle's losing heart. Far better is it to supply after "every evil work" the words "<span class= "ital">of the enemies," </span>and to understand the deliverance which the Lord will accomplish for him, not as a deliverance from any shrinking or timidity unworthy of an apostle of the Lord, not even as a deliverance from the martyr-death, which he knew lay before him, <span class= "ital">but that through this very death, </span>the Lord Jesus would deliver him from all weariness and toil, and would bring him safe into His heavenly kingdom. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm" title="Yes, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for you are with me; your rod and your staff they comfort me.">Psalm 23:4</a>.) St. Paul before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-23.htm" title="For I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:">Philippians 1:23</a> had expressed a longing to come to Christ through death. He then bursts into an ascription of praise to that Lord Jesus Christ whom he had loved so long and so well, and who, in all his troubles and perplexities, had never left him friendless. For a similar ascription of glory to the Second Person of the ever blessed Trinity, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-21.htm" title="Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.">Hebrews 13:21</a>. (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-5.htm" title="Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.">Romans 9:5</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="accented">The Lord</span> for <span class="accented">and the Lord</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">will</span> for <span class="accented">shall</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">save</span> for <span class="accented">preserve</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the glory</span> for <span class="accented">glory</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Deliver me... save me</span> (see preceding note).

Interpreted by the Lord's Prayer, and by its own internal evidence, the meaning clearly is, "The Lord, who stood by me at my trial, will continue to be my Saviour. He will deliver me from every evil design of mine enemies, and from all the wiles and assaults of the devil, in short, from the whole power of evil, and will bring me safe into his own kingdom of light and righteousness." There is a strong contrast, as Bengel pithily observes, between "the evil work" and "his heavenly kingdom." A triumphant martyrdom is as true a deliverance as escape from death. Compare our Lord's promise, "There shall not an hair of your head perish" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-18.htm">Luke 21:18</a> compared with ver. 16). St. Paul's confidence simply is that the Lord would, in his own good time and way, transfer him from this present evil world, and from the powers of darkness, into his eternal kingdom of light and righteousness. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:14-18 There is as much danger from false brethren, as from open enemies. It is dangerous having to do with those who would be enemies to such a man as Paul. The Christians at Rome were forward to meet him, Ac 28, but when there seemed to be a danger of suffering with him, then all forsook him. God might justly be angry with them, but he prays God to forgive them. The apostle was delivered out of the mouth of the lion, that is, of Nero, or some of his judges. If the Lord stands by us, he will strengthen us in difficulties and dangers, and his presence will more than supply every one's absence.</body></html>
