"This 'but' appears to refer to a suppressed thought, suggested by the concluding portion of the last (11th) verse: bring Mark. I need one who is profitable (or <span class= "ital">serviceable</span>) for the ministry. I had one in Tychicus, <span class= "ital">but</span> he is gone" (Ellicott). Neither the period of Tychicus' journey nor its object is alluded <span class= "ital">to</span> here. It probably took place some time, however, before the sending of this Epistle to Timothy. Tychicus was evidently one of the trusted companions of St. Paul. He had been with him, we know, on his third missionary journey, and had, during St. Paul's first Roman imprisonment, some six or seven years before, been charged with a mission by his master to Ephesus. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-21.htm" title="But that you also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:">Ephesians 6:21</a> he is called a beloved brother and a faithful minister in the Lord. (See, too, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-7.htm" title=" All my state shall Tychicus declare to you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord:">Colossians 4:7</a>, where he is spoken of in similar terms.) On the city of Ephesus, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm" title="As I sought you to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine,">1Timothy 1:3</a>. It has been, with considerable probability, suggested that Tychicus had been the bearer of the first Epistle to Timothy. Between the writing of these two letters, we know, no great interval could have elapsed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="accented">But</span> for <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">sent</span> for <span class="accented">have sent</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Tychicus</span> was with St. Paul when he wrote the Epistle to the Colossians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7</a>), as was also Timothy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-1.htm">Colossians 1:1</a>). The presence of Luke, Timothy, Tychicus, Mark, with Paul now, as then, is remarkable (see ver. 10, note). <span class="cmt_word">I sent to Ephesus.</span> Theodoret (quoted by Alford, 'Proleg. to 2 Timothy,' ch. 9. sect. 1) says, "It is plain from this that St. Timothy was not at this time living at Ephesus, but somewhere else." And that certainly is the natural inference at first sight. But Bishop Ellicott suggests the possibility of Tychicus being the bearer of the First Epistle to Timothy, written not very long before, and this being merely an allusion to that well known fact. Another and more probable idea is that he was the bearer of this Epistle, that the object of his mission, like that of Artemas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>), was to take Timothy's place at Ephesus during Timothy's absence at Rome, and that he is thus mentioned in the Epistle in order to commend him to the reverent regard of the Ephesian Church (Wordsworth). It is argued against this that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> would have been the more natural expression after the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>. But this objection would be removed if we suppose that the Epistle was sent by another hand, and that it was very possible that Timothy might have started for Rome before Tychicus could arrive at Ephesus. He might have orders to visit Corinth or Macedonia on his way. (For the arguments for and against Timothy being at Ephesus at this time, see Alford's 'Proleg.,' as above.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:9-13 The love of this world, is often the cause of turning back from the truths and ways of Jesus Christ. Paul was guided by Divine inspiration, yet he would have his books. As long as we live, we must still learn. The apostles did not neglect human means, in seeking the necessaries of life, or their own instruction. Let us thank the Divine goodness in having given us so many writings of wise and pious men in all ages; and let us seek that by reading them our profiting may appear to all.</body></html>
