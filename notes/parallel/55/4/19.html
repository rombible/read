Originally of Pontus, they had taken up their abode at Rome, where Aquila exercised his trade of a tent-maker.<p>Driven out of Rome by the decree of Claudius, which banished the Jews from the capital, they came to Corinth, where St. Paul became acquainted with them. But they were evidently Christians when St. Paul first met them, about A.D. 51-2. We hear of them in company with St. Paul at Corinth, about A.D. 52-3 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-2.htm" title="And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came to them.">Acts 18:2</a>); at Ephesus, about A.D. 55 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-19.htm" title="The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.">1Corinthians 16:19</a>); and in the year A.D. 58 St. Paul sends greetings to them at Rome (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-3.htm" title="Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:">Romans 16:3</a>).<p>They were, evidently, among the many active and zealous teachers of the first days of the faith. That they possessed great ability as well as zeal is evident from the fact that it was from them that the eloquent and trained Alexandrian master, Apollos, learnt to be a Christian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-26.htm" title="And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him to them, and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly.">Acts 18:26</a>). In this place, and in several other passages, Prisca (or Priscilla) is named <span class= "ital">before </span>her husband, Aquila. This would seem to hint that in this case the woman was the principal worker of the two in the cause of Christ. She, in fact, was one of that band of devoted holy women which the preaching of Christ and His disciples had called into existence: a representative of the great class of noble female workers which had no existence before Christ told the world what was the true position of women--until the same divine Master taught them that they, too, as well as men, had a work to work for Him here.<p><span class= "bld">And the household of Onesiphorus.</span>--St. Paul may have been aware that Onesiphorus was absent then from Ephesus; but this peculiar greeting, taken together with the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-16.htm" title="The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:">2Timothy 1:16</a>, leads us irresistibly to the conclusion that this friend of St. Paul's was dead when the Epistle was written. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-16.htm" title="The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:">2Timothy 1:16</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="accented">House</span> for <span class="accented">household</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Prisca and Aquila.</span> Prisca is elsewhere always called <span class="accented">Priscilla</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-2.htm">Acts 18:2, 18, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>). A similar variation of names is seen in <span class="accented">Drusa</span> and <span class="accented">Drusilla, Livia</span> and <span class="accented">Livella</span>, etc. She is named before her husband, as here in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-18.htm">Acts 18:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3</a>. The mention of them here is in favour of Timothy being at Ephesus at this time, as Ephesus is one of the places where they were wont to sojourn (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-19.htm">Acts 18:19, 26</a>). The house (as in A.V. ch. 1:16) of Onesiphorus (see ch. 1:16, 18, note). This repetition of the "house of Onesiphorus" is almost conclusive as to the recent death of Onesiphorus himself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:19-22 We need no more to make us happy, than to have the Lord Jesus Christ with our spirits; for in him all spiritual blessings are summed up. It is the best prayer we can offer for our friends, that the Lord Jesus Christ may be with their spirits, to sanctify and save them, and at last to receive them to himself. Many who believed as Paul, are now before the throne, giving glory to their Lord: may we be followers of them.</body></html>
