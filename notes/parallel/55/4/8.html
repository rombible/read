The crown was the victory prize which the "good fight" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-7.htm" title="I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:">2Timothy 4:7</a> had won. It is called "the crown of righteousness," it being the crown to which righteousness can lay claim--that <span class= "ital">is, </span>the crown awarded to righteousness.<p><span class= "bld">Which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me.</span>--As a righteous judge will the Lord award him the crown, recognising him as one who had the prize of victory. Not improbably, the expression "the righteous judge" was written in strong contrast to that unrighteous judge who had condemned Paul, and in accordance with whose unjust sentence he would presently suffer a painful death.<p><span class= "bld">At that day.</span>--This is the third time the words "that day" are used in this Epistle (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/1-12.htm" title="For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day.">2Timothy 1:12-18</a>). The day of judgment is, of course, signified, the day when the Lord shall come again with glory.<p><span class= "bld">And not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</span>--Then St. Paul, instead of concluding this section of his letter with the glorious words telling of his serene courage and of his confidence in a crowned and immortal life, adds a gentle reminder to Timothy: <span class= "ital">he, </span>too, with any others who really look for the Second Coming of the Lord, might win the same glorious crown--the sure guerdon of righteousness. The Apostle specifies here exactly the persons for whom "the crown" was reserved--those who in this life have <span class= "ital">indeed</span> longed for the appearance of the Lord in judgment. None here could in very truth desire "His appearing," save His own, who love Him and struggle to live His life. Calvin well remarks: "(St. Paul) excludes from the number of the faithful those to whom Christ's coming is a source of terror."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> for <span class="accented">a</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">to me</span> for <span class="accented">me</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">only to me</span> for <span class="accented">to me only</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">also to all them</span> for <span class="accented">unto all them also</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">have loved</span> for <span class="accented">love. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Henceforth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>); as <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-13.htm">Hebrews 10:13</a>. The work of conflict being over, it only remains to receive the crown. <span class="cmt_word">The crown of righteousness</span> means that crown the possession of which marks the wearer as righteous before God. The analogous phrases are, "the crown of glory" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-4.htm">1 Peter 5:4</a>) and "the crown of life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>). The righteousness, the glory, and the life of the saints are conceived as displayed in crowns, as the kingly dignity is in the crown of royalty. <span class="cmt_word">The righteous Judge</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-42.htm">Acts 10:42</a> the Lord Jesus is said to be ordained of God <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. "the Judge of quick and dead;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-23.htm">Hebrews 12:23</a> we read, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "God the Judge of all." But nowhere else, either in the Old Testament or the New Testament, is this term applied directly either to God or to Christ. Surely its use here is influenced by the preceding metaphor of the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; and "the righteous Judge" is the impartial <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, or "judge," who assigned the prizes at the games to those who had fairly won them. And this is the proper meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, "the umpire," applied, especially at Athens, to the "judges" at the poetic contests (Liddell and Scott). Thucydides contrasts the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>; Aristophanes the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, the "spectators;" and the word "critic" is derived from this meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The whole picture is that of the apostle running his noble race of righteousness to the very end, and of the Lord himself assigning to him the well earned crown of victory in the presence of heaven and earth assembled for the solemnity of that great day. <span class="cmt_word">That have loved his appearing.</span> It will be a characteristic of those who will be crowned at that day that all the time they were lighting the good fight they were looking forward with hope and desire for their Lord's appearing and kingdom. "Thy kingdom come" was their desire and their petition. They will be able to say at that day, "So, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-9.htm">Isaiah 25:9</a>). <span class="accented">His appearing</span>; as in ver. 2. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:6-8 The blood of the martyrs, though not a sacrifice of atonement, yet was a sacrifice of acknowledgment to the grace of God and his truth. Death to a good man, is his release from the imprisonment of this world, and his departure to the enjoyments of another world. As a Christian, and a minister, Paul had kept the faith, kept the doctrines of the gospel. What comfort will it afford, to be able to speak in this manner toward the end of our days! The crown of believers is a crown of righteousness, purchased by the righteousness of Christ. Believers have it not at present, yet it is sure, for it is laid up for them. The believer, amidst poverty, pain, sickness, and the agonies of death, may rejoice; but if the duties of a man's place and station are neglected, his evidence of interest in Christ will be darkened, and uncertainty and distress may be expected to cloud and harass his last hours.</body></html>
