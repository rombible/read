The word translated "endure hardness" in the older authorities is compounded with a preposition, and is better and more literally rendered, <span class= "ital">take thy share in suffering.</span> But Timothy must remember, if he obeys St. Paul's voice, and with steady earnestness follows St. Paul's tracks, the very same sufferings which have been the master's guerdon will be the lot of the loyal disciple. So St. Paul adds, "Take thy share of suffering," or, "Suffer hardship with me." Timothy must be prepared for this. He must look on himself as one of the pioneers of the army of the great King, as a tried veteran, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ, prepared for the dangers and trials which in those days awaited such a calling. Then, under three different pictures, the Apostle paints the duties and rewards of a Christian's life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="accented">Suffer hardship with me</span> for <span class="accented">thou therefore endure hardness</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">Christ Jesus</span> for <span class="accented">Jesus Christ</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Suffer hardship with me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), which is the reading "supported by the weightiest authorities" (Huther), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-8.htm">2 Timothy 1:8</a>. The simple form <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which is the reading of the T.R., occurs also in ver. 9 of this chapter, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-13.htm">James 5:13</a>, and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-10.htm">James 5:10</a>.

This is opposed to our being strong in our own strength. All Christians, but especially ministers, must be faithful to their Captain, and resolute in his cause. The great care of a Christian must be to please Christ. We are to strive to get the mastery of our lusts and corruptions, but we cannot expect the prize unless we observe the laws. We must take care that we do good in a right manner, that our good may not be spoken evil of. Some who are active, spend their zeal about outward forms and doubtful disputations. But those who strive lawfully shall be crowned at last. If we would partake the fruits, we must labour; if we would gain the prize, we must run the race. We must do the will of God, before we receive the promises, for which reason we have need of patience. Together with our prayers for others, that the Lord would give them understanding in all things, we must exhort and stir them up to consider what they hear or read.</body></html>
