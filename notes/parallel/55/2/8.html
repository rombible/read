The translation should run thus: <span class= "ital">Remember Jesus Christ as one raised from the dead, born of the seed of David.</span> Timothy was to remember, was ever to bear in mind, two great facts. They were to be the foundation stones of his whole life's work. Remembering these in the hour of his greatest trouble, he was never to be cast down, but ever to take fresh courage. And the two facts he was to remember were: that Jesus Christ, for whose sake he suffered--like him, Timothy, or like St. Paul--was born of flesh and blood, and yet He had risen from the dead. Surely, in the hour of his weakness, such a thought would be sufficient to inspire him with comfort and courage. Two facts, then, are to be ever in Timothy's mind: the Resurrection and the Incarnation of his Lord. The thought of the first mentioned, "the Resurrection," would always be reminding him of his Master's victory over death and of His present glory. The thought of the second mentioned, "born of the seed of David," "the Incarnation," would ever be whispering to him, "Yes, and the risen and glorified One sprang, too, like himself, from mortal flesh and blood." The reason of the "Incarnation" being expressed in this special manner, "born of the seed of David," was to include another truth. The "risen One "was not only born of flesh and blood, but belonged to the very race specified in those prophets so revered by Timothy and the chosen people as <span class= "ital">the</span> race from which should spring the Messiah: "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth . . . and this is His name whereby He shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/23-5.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>). To raise the fainting heart of his much-tried disciple in this hour of discouragement, to supply a ground of confidence to yet unborn Christians, who in their day would be tried as Timothy was then, was the Apostle's first purpose when he pressed these thoughts on his son in the faith; but in the background, no doubt, there lay another purpose. These great comforting truths were to be maintained and taught in the presence of those false teachers who were ever ready to explain away or even to deny, <span class= "ital">then as now, </span>the beginning and the end of the Son of God's life and ministry on earth--His Incarnation and His Resurrection.<p><span class= "bld">According to my gospel.</span>--This formula, for so it may be considered, occurs frequently in St. Paul's Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-16.htm" title="In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.">Romans 2:16</a>, and again <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25</a>, and in other places), and, with very slight variations, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-11.htm" title="According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.">1Timothy 1:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-1.htm" title="Moreover, brothers, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received, and wherein you stand;">1Corinthians 15:1</a>. Jerome's remark, "As often as St. Paul in his Epistles writes '<span class= "ital">according to my Gospel,</span>' he refers to the volume of Luke," although received with reserve by many expositors, considering the weighty traditional evidence we possess of St. Luke's Gospel being in reality written by St. Paul, appears on the whole substantially correct.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="accented">Jesus Christ, risen from the dead</span> for <span class="accented">that Jesus Christ...was raised from the dead</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">of the seed of David</span> for <span class="accented">Jesus Christ of the seed of David</span>, A.V. Remember Jesus Christ. The A.V. seems to give the sense more correctly than the R.V. The point of the exhortation is to remember that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead, and by that remembrance to be encouraged to face even death courageously. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>, in the New Testament, usually governs the genitive case as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-10.htm">Galatians 2:10</a>. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-9.htm">Matthew 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-5.htm">Revelation 18:5</a>, it has an accusative, as here, and commonly in classical Greek. There seems to be hardly sufficient ground for the distinction mentioned by Bishop Ellicott, that with a genitive it means simply "remember," with the accusative "keep in remembrance." It is more difficult to determine the exact force and intent of the clause, "of the seed of David." It seems, however, to point to Christ's human nature, so as to make the example of Christ's resurrection apposite as an encouragement to Timothy. And this view is much strengthened by <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>, where the addition, "according to the flesh," as contrasted with "the Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness," marks the clause, "of the seed of David," as specially pointing to the human nature of Christ. The particular form which the reference takes probably arises from the form to which the apostle refers us as "my gospel." In that creed, which was the epitome of the gospel as preached by St. Paul, there was no doubt mention made of Christ's Davidic descent. Others, as Huther, think the clause points to the Messianic dignity of David. Others that it is inserted in refutation of the Docetae, and to show the reality of the death and resurrection of Christ; or that it is meant to mark especially the fulfilment of prophecy. But the first explanation is quite satisfactory, and the general purpose of the reference to our Lord as intended to encourage Timothy to endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ, is fully borne out by the "faithful saying" in vers. 11 and 12, "If we died with him, we shall also live with him: if we endure, we shall also reign with him." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-13 Let suffering saints remember, and look to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of their faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despised the shame, and is now set down at the right hand of the throne of God. We must not think it strange if the best men meet with the worst treatment; but this is cheering, that the word of God is not bound. Here we see the real and true cause of the apostle's suffering trouble in, or for, the sake of the gospel. If we are dead to this world, its pleasures, profits, and honours, we shall be for ever with Christ in a better world. He is faithful to his threatenings, and faithful to his promises. This truth makes sure the unbeliever's condemnation, and the believer's salvation.</body></html>
