In <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-10.htm" title="A man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition reject;">Titus 3:10</a> we read how these pronounced heretics--no doubt the teachers and leaders of the school--were, after a first and second admonition, to be shunned, were to be left to themselves. These, however, were evidently to be dealt with in a different manner. Their treatment was to be a gentle one. Nothing is here said respecting a first and second admonition only; no hint is given that these are to be shunned. They are clearly not the same as those referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-10.htm" title="A man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition reject;">Titus 3:10</a>, or above in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-21.htm" title="If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honor, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared to every good work.">2Timothy 2:21</a> of this chapter, where, again, separation is definitely urged.<p><span class= "bld">If God peradventure will give them repentance.</span>--The Greek original here also carries out what was said in the Note on the last clause, and may be rendered literally, <span class= "ital">if perchance at any time God might</span> <span class= "ital">grant to them</span> . . . This suggests a hope at least that at some time or other God's grace would work in these "opposing" members of the congregation a change. The "repentance" here signifies an abandonment on the part of those erring Christians of that wrong course on which they had entered, and a return to the true Church of God and to the full knowledge of the gospel truth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="accented">Correcting them</span> for <span class="accented">instructing those</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">peradventure God</span> for <span class="accented">God peradventure</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">may</span> for <span class="accented">will</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">unto the knowledge</span> for <span class="accented">to the acknowledging</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Correcting</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>), <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> means properly to "educate," "bring up," or "train" a child. Hence sometimes the idea of <span class="accented">teaching</span> predominates, sometimes that of <span class="accented">correcting</span> or chastising. Here the context shows that the idea of <span class="accented">teaching</span> is pre-dominant - partly because the word suggests something contrary to the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> of ver. 23, and partly because the end of this <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is to bring them to the knowledge of God's truth. The A.V. "instructing" is therefore the right word here. Them that oppose themselves (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>); only here in the New Testament or the LXX., or in classical Greek. Literally, <span class="accented">those who arrange</span> or <span class="accented">set themselves in opposition</span>; or, in one word, "opponents," referring, no doubt, chiefly to such <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> as are mentioned in the very similar passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-9.htm">Titus 1:9</a> (see too <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-8.htm">Titus 2:8</a>). If peradventure (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). "<span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, in later Greek, loses its aversative meaning ('lest at any time'), and is almost equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> (Alford, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) - <span class="accented">equivalent</span> to "in case God should," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Repentance</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>); such a change of mind as shall lead them to embrace the truth. <span class="cmt_word">Knowledge</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>); almost invariably used of the knowledge of God or of God's truth (ch. 3:7; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-1.htm">Titus 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The truth</span>; that truth which before they set themselves to oppose, disputing against it and resisting it. The servant of the Lord must never despair of any one, never throw an additional obstacle in any one's way by roughness or harsh speech, and never allow unkind feelings to be roused in his own breast by the perverseness or unreasonableness of them that oppose themselves to him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:22-26 The more we follow that which is good, the faster and the further we shall flee from that which is evil. The keeping up the communion of saints, will take us from fellowship with unfruitful works of darkness. See how often the apostle cautions against disputes in religion; which surely shows that religion consists more in believing and practising what God requires, than in subtle disputes. Those are unapt to teach, who are apt to strive, and are fierce and froward. Teaching, not persecution, is the Scripture method of dealing with those in error. The same God who gives the discovery of the truth, by his grace brings us to acknowledge it, otherwise our hearts would continue to rebel against it. There is no peradventure, in respect of God's pardoning those who do repent; but we cannot tell that he will give repentance to those who oppose his will. Sinners are taken in a snare, and in the worst snare, because it is the devil's; they are slaves to him. And if any long for deliverance, let them remember they never can escape, except by repentance, which is the gift of God; and we must ask it of him by earnest, persevering prayer.</body></html>
