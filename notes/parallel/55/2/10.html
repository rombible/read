And this brave and steadfast endurance on the part of St. Paul contributed to the furtherance of God's projects for gathering these elect in this wise--(1) His endurance, his patient, gallant witness in suffering, would serve as an example to many, not only to the generation then living, but to countless men and women yet unborn; and (2) his faithful, true preaching, now that his voice was hushed, in such writings as this Epistle to Timothy, would help, through the ages to come, to draw countless others, in accordance with the divine counsels, into fellowship with Christ. The question has been often asked, whether those "elect" or whom the Apostle endured these things were, when he wrote these words, <span class= "ital">believers.</span> This point has already been touched upon; it may, however, be here answered, with some certainty, that the "elect" here spoken of include both believers and unbelievers. The first--the believer--would in all ages be built up by the contemplation of the steadfastness under suffering of St. Paul; the second--the unbeliever--would be won to the faith by the divinely-inspired arguments and exhortations which the brave old man ceaselessly spoke or wrote down in prison just as when free. How could one like St. Paul, who was conscious that he himself had won the "salvation," <span class= "ital">not patiently endure</span> all things, if such an endurance could help the elect to obtain that salvation which delivered those who obtained it from the misery of sin and death, and which besides--O blessed thought!--had the sure prospect of eternal glory?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="accented">Sake</span> for <span class="accented">sakes</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">also may</span> for <span class="accented">may also</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>); <span class="accented">for this cause.</span> Some (Wiesinger, Alford, etc.) refer this to what follows, viz. "that the elect may obtain the salvation," etc., after the model of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-16.htm">1 Timothy 1:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-15.htm">Philemon 1:15</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> clearly refers to the words which follow. But the interposition of the words, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, is strongly adverse to this view. It seems, therefore, rather to refer collectively to all the considerations which he had just been urging upon Timothy, perhaps especially the last, of the resurrection of Christ, which he now again enforces by his own example of willing suffering in order that the elect may obtain the eternal salvation which is in Jesus Christ - adding, in vers. 11 and 12, the encouragement to suffering derived from the "faithful saying." <span class="cmt_word">I endure</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>); the exact force of which is seen in the substantive <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, patience, so frequently attributed to the suffering saints of God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-13 Let suffering saints remember, and look to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of their faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despised the shame, and is now set down at the right hand of the throne of God. We must not think it strange if the best men meet with the worst treatment; but this is cheering, that the word of God is not bound. Here we see the real and true cause of the apostle's suffering trouble in, or for, the sake of the gospel. If we are dead to this world, its pleasures, profits, and honours, we shall be for ever with Christ in a better world. He is faithful to his threatenings, and faithful to his promises. This truth makes sure the unbeliever's condemnation, and the believer's salvation.</body></html>
