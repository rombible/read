This it is which the Apostle will help others to win, regardless of any suffering it may cost him; then, with his mind full of the thoughts of the "eternal glory," once more he addressed himself to Timothy. "Faithful is the saying, namely, if we be dead with him," &c. It was as though he said, "Do you not remember that well-known watchword of our own faith, so often repeated among us in our solemn assemblies when the brotherhood meet together?" Many have supposed, from the rhythmical character of the clauses of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/2-11.htm" title="It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:">2Timothy 2:11-13</a>, that this "saying" was taken from some most ancient Christian hymns, composed and used in the very earliest days of the faith; but whether or no this be the case, there is high probability that the words formed part of a liturgy in common use in the days of Timothy. If not as a hymn--which seems, on the whole, the most likely supposition--we can well conceive them as part of the tapestry of a primitive Christian liturgy, woven in like the introductory sentences in our morning and evening prayer, or like the "comfortable words" of the Communion Service. The expression "If we be dead with Him"--more accurately, <span class= "ital">If we died with Him</span>--is well explained by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-31.htm" title="I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our LORD, I die daily.">1Corinthians 15:31</a> : "I die daily." The Apostle <span class= "ital">died</span> when he embraced the lot of daily death. The meaning is still further illustrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.">2Corinthians 4:10</a>, where we read how St. Paul and his companions were "always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus." "He and his faithful companions (was Timothy, to whom he was then writing, to be ranked in this blessed company? ) had given themselves up to a life that involved exposure to sufferings, bitter enmity, cruel persecutions, even death; but if we be thus dead with Him, what matters it? How can we fear even that last agony man can inflict on us--physical death?--for <span class= "ital">death</span> with Him involves, surely, <span class= "ital">life</span> with Him too: that life endless, fadeless, full of glory, we know He is now enjoying, in the possession of which I, Paul, and some of us have even seen Him, face to face, eye to eye. In that life of His we shall share; we shall be partakers in this life of His <span class= "ital">there, </span>but only if we have shared in the life of suffering which was His life <span class= "ital">here.</span>"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="accented">Faithful is the saying</span> for <span class="accented">it is a faithful saying</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">died</span> for <span class="accented">be dead</span>, A.V. Died; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in baptism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-8.htm">Romans 6:8</a>), as denoted by the aorist. But the death with Christ in baptism is conceived of as carrying with it, as a consequence, the daily death of which St. Paul speaks so often (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-31.htm">1 Corinthians 15:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10</a>), as well as the death to sin. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-13 Let suffering saints remember, and look to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of their faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despised the shame, and is now set down at the right hand of the throne of God. We must not think it strange if the best men meet with the worst treatment; but this is cheering, that the word of God is not bound. Here we see the real and true cause of the apostle's suffering trouble in, or for, the sake of the gospel. If we are dead to this world, its pleasures, profits, and honours, we shall be for ever with Christ in a better world. He is faithful to his threatenings, and faithful to his promises. This truth makes sure the unbeliever's condemnation, and the believer's salvation.</body></html>
