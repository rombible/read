And so here everything which is likely to be the cause of strife, heart-burning, or hot words, is, St. Paul urges, singularly out of place in the life of a servant of that Lord who fulfilled to the letter that Isaiah prophecy of Messiah, "He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear His voice in the streets." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-19.htm" title="He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.">Matthew 12:19-20</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">But be gentle unto all men.</span>--Quiet and kind, not only to those belonging to the brotherhood of Christ, but, as is expressly mentioned, <span class= "ital">to all.</span> It is noteworthy how, in these Pastoral Epistles--which contain, so to speak, the last general directions to believers in Jesus as to life as well as doctrine of perhaps the greatest of the inspired teachers--so many careful suggestions are given for the guidance of Christians in all their relations with the great heathen world. <span class= "ital">Conciliation</span> may be termed the key-note of these directions. St. Paul would press upon Timothy and his successors the great truth that it was the Master's will that the unnumbered peoples who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death should learn, by slow though sure degrees, how lovely and desirable a thing it was to be a Christian; should come at length to see clearly that Christ was, after all, the only lover and real friend of man.<p><span class= "bld">Apt to teach, patient.</span>--The Greek word is better rendered by the <span class= "ital">forbearing</span> of the margin than by "patient." <span class= "ital">Patient of wrong, </span>however, best gives the full force of the original. This is what the servant of God should really aim at being: the teacher rather than the controversialist--rather the patient endurer of wrong than the fomenter of dissensions and wordy strifes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="accented">The Lord's servant</span> for <span class="accented">the servant of the Lord</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">towards all</span> for <span class="accented">unto all men</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">forbearing</span> for <span class="accented">patient</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord's servant</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). So St. Paul repeatedly describes himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-1.htm">Titus 1:1</a>), as do also the apostles James, Peter, Jude, and John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-1.htm">Jude 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>). The term seems, therefore, especially (though not exclusively, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-6.htm">Ephesians 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-16.htm">1 Peter 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-2.htm">Revelation 19:2, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-3.htm">Revelation 22:3</a>) to describe those whose office it is to preach the gospel, either as apostles or as ministers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Must not strive</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); a conclusive reason against engaging in those foolish and ignorant questionings which necessarily engender strife. <span class="cmt_word">Gentle</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:7</a>, where we see how St. Paul carried this precept into practice. A nurse does not meet the child's waywardness by blows or threats, but by gentleness and love. It is a classical word. <span class="cmt_word">Apt to teach</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">Forbearing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); only here in the New Testament, not found in the LXX., and only in late Greek. It means literally "bearing up against ill treatment," patiently enduring it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:22-26 The more we follow that which is good, the faster and the further we shall flee from that which is evil. The keeping up the communion of saints, will take us from fellowship with unfruitful works of darkness. See how often the apostle cautions against disputes in religion; which surely shows that religion consists more in believing and practising what God requires, than in subtle disputes. Those are unapt to teach, who are apt to strive, and are fierce and froward. Teaching, not persecution, is the Scripture method of dealing with those in error. The same God who gives the discovery of the truth, by his grace brings us to acknowledge it, otherwise our hearts would continue to rebel against it. There is no peradventure, in respect of God's pardoning those who do repent; but we cannot tell that he will give repentance to those who oppose his will. Sinners are taken in a snare, and in the worst snare, because it is the devil's; they are slaves to him. And if any long for deliverance, let them remember they never can escape, except by repentance, which is the gift of God; and we must ask it of him by earnest, persevering prayer.</body></html>
