"Cancer," which is adopted also by Luther--krebs--fails to express the terrible and deathly nature of the "word" of these false teachers. The life of the sufferer afflicted with cancer may be prolonged for many years; a few hours, however, is sufficient to put a term to the life of the patient attacked with "gangrene," unless the limb affected be at once cut away. To translate this Greek word here by "cancer" is to water down the original, in which St. Paul expresses his dread of the fatal influence of the words of these teachers on the lives of many of the flock of Christ. Perhaps Jerome's words, "a perverse doctrine, beginning with one, at the commencement scarcely finds two or three listeners; but little by little the cancer creeps through the body" (Jerome. in <span class= "ital">Epist. ad Gal.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>has suggested the rendering of the English Version.<p><span class= "bld">Of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus.</span>--Of these false teachers nothing is known beyond the mention, in the First Epistle to Timothy, of Hymenaeus, who, regardless of the severe action which had been taken against him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-20.htm" title="Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.">1Timothy 1:20</a>), was apparently still continuing in his error. Vitringa thinks they were Jews, and probably Samaritans. Their names are simply given as examples of the teachers of error to whom St. Paul was referring--famous leaders, no doubt, in their cheerless school of doctrine.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="accented">Gangrene</span> for <span class="accented">canker</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Their word;</span> as opposed to "the Word of truth" in ver. 15. <span class="cmt_word">Will eat</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> spread, like a gangrene, which gradually enlarges its area, corrupting the flesh that was sound before.

But strifes of words destroy the things of God. The apostle mentions some who erred. They did not deny the resurrection, but they corrupted that true doctrine. Yet nothing can be so foolish or erroneous, but it will overturn the temporary faith of some professors. This foundation has two writings on it. One speaks our comfort. None can overthrow the faith of any whom God hath chosen. The other speaks our duty. Those who would have the comfort of the privilege, must make conscience of the duty Christ gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, Tit 2:14. The church of Christ is like a dwelling: some furniture is of great value; some of smaller value, and put to meaner uses. Some professors of religion are like vessels of wood and earth. When the vessels of dishonour are cast out to be destroyed, the others will be filled with all the fulness of God. We must see to it that we are holy vessels. Every one in the church whom God approves, will be devoted to his Master's service, and thus fitted for his use.</body></html>
