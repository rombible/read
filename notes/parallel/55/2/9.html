Surely his disciple, still free, ought to work on with undiminished spirit and zeal. Though St. Paul was in bonds, his sufferings and imprisonment had in no way weakened the power of the gospel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="accented">Hardship</span> for <span class="accented">trouble</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">unto</span> for <span class="accented">even unto</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">as a malefactor</span> for <span class="accented">as an evil doer</span>, A.V.; transposition of clause, <span class="accented">unto bonds. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Wherein</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1ff7;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in which gospel, in the preaching of which. <span class="cmt_word">Suffer hardship</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;</span>); as ver. 3, T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Unto bonds</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>).

The thought of his own bonds, likely soon to be exchanged for the bonds of a martyr's death, awakens the comforting thought, Though they bind me with an iron chain, they cannot bind the gospel. While I am here, shut up in prison, the Word of God, preached by a thousand tongues, is giving life and liberty to myriads of my brethren of the human race. The tyrant can silence my voice and confine it within the walls of my dungeon; but all the while the sound of the gospel is going through all the earth, its saving words to the ends of the world; and I therein rejoice, yea, and will rejoice; and not all the lemons of Rome can take this joy from me." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-13 Let suffering saints remember, and look to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of their faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despised the shame, and is now set down at the right hand of the throne of God. We must not think it strange if the best men meet with the worst treatment; but this is cheering, that the word of God is not bound. Here we see the real and true cause of the apostle's suffering trouble in, or for, the sake of the gospel. If we are dead to this world, its pleasures, profits, and honours, we shall be for ever with Christ in a better world. He is faithful to his threatenings, and faithful to his promises. This truth makes sure the unbeliever's condemnation, and the believer's salvation.</body></html>
