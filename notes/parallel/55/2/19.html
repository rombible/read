"The firm foundation laid by God" is the Church of Christ, which is here termed <span class= "ital">a foundation</span> laid by God, because it, the Church of Christ, is the ground-storey of the glorious Temple of the future. In other words, the Church of Christ is here considered as the foundation of a far grander building, which, in the fulness of time, will rest upon its massive work (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/2-19.htm" title="Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>)<span class= "ital">., </span>and this ground-storey, the corner-stone of which is Christ, "standeth" age after age, in spite of any efforts which may be made to destroy or even to shake it. The term "foundation," here used for the Church of God on earth, is remarkable, and points to a great truth: that, after all, this life is but a beginning, and that "His Church" here is but a foundation--is only the first and early storey of that glorious Church the Divine Architect has planned, and will complete in heaven.<p><span class= "bld">Having this seal.</span>--It was a custom, which dates back from the very earliest times, to inscribe upon a building or a monument an inscription which told of its origin and purpose. In some cases, as in the oldest monuments of Egypt, the engraved writing told the name of the royal or priestly builder; so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-14.htm" title="And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.">Revelation 21:14</a>, we read how in the wall of the City of God there were twelve foundations, and on them were engraved the names of the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb. On this "foundation storey," of which St. Paul was now speaking, was carved a legible inscription in two sentences--the one told of comfort and hope, reminding men God would ever know "His own;" the other told of duty, reminding men that "God's own" had no share in unrighteousness. It is called "a seal" here instead of an inscription, for a seal best conveys the idea of the solemn binding character of the writing.<p>The Jew was especially accustomed to see the words and promises of his God written or graven on his doorposts and on his gates. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-9.htm" title="And you shall write them on the posts of your house, and on your gates.">Deuteronomy 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-20.htm" title="And you shall write them on the door posts of your house, and on your gates:">Deuteronomy 11:20</a>. See, too, the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-24.htm" title="That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!">Job 19:24</a>, where he would have his most solemn declaration of faith graven or sealed on a rock for ever.)<p><span class= "bld">The Lord knoweth them that are his.</span>--This was the first sentence of the inscription graven on the foundation-storey. The <span class= "ital">words</span> were probably a memory of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-5.htm" title="And he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will show who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near to him: even him whom he has chosen will he cause to come near to him.">Numbers 16:5</a>; but the <span class= "ital">thought</span> here goes far deeper. God's own people, as they read the words graven on the foundation "with an iron pen and with lead for ever," are ever reminded of their deepest, highest, truest comfort. "The Lord <span class= "ital">knoweth</span> them that are His." The words may be paraphrased: "He knows His own because He loves them;" never will He cease to know them, but will keep them for ever and for ever. Compare, too, the words of the Good Shepherd (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-14.htm" title="I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.">John 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/10-27.htm" title="My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:">John 10:27-29</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And, Let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</span>--The thought and the words are from the Old Testament. The thought is expressed in a wider and more general form in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-11.htm" title="Depart you, depart you, go you out from there, touch no unclean thing; go you out of the middle of her; be you clean, that bear the vessels of the LORD.">Isaiah 52:11</a> : "Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing . . . Be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord;" and for the words "nameth the name of the Lord," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-13.htm" title="O LORD our God, other lords beside you have had dominion over us: but by you only will we make mention of your name.">Isaiah 26:13</a>. "Naming the name of Jesus" must be understood in the sense of the last clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm" title="Why I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.">1Corinthians 12:3</a>; in other words, this sentence of the inscription signifies that no man confessing with the <span class= "ital">heart</span> that Jesus is Lord can commit iniquity deliberately--the two things are utterly incompatible. "Iniquity" here includes the teaching of those false men above alluded to, as their teaching led away from the truth, and resulted in a lax and evil way of life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="accented">Howbeit</span> for <span class="accented">nevertheless</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">firm foundation of God standeth</span> for <span class="accented">foundation of God standeth sure</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">this</span> for <span class="accented">the</span> (1611 copy), A.V.; <span class="accented">the Lord</span> for <span class="accented">Christ</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">unrighteousness</span> for <span class="accented">iniquity</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The firm foundation of God standeth;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, though the faith of some is thrown down like a wall built with untempered mortar, the foundation which God has laid fast and firm stands unmoved and unmovable. This is equally true of individual souls (the at <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> of Chrysostom), and of the Church, against which the gates of hell shall not prevail. Compare our Lord's saying, when the Pharisees were offended at him, "Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-13.htm">Matthew 15:13</a>); and those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28, 29</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-19.htm">1 John 2:19</a>. <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in classical Greek is always an adjective agreeing with <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> expressed or understood. In the New Testament it is used only as a substantive (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-48.htm">Luke 6:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-19.htm">1 Timothy 6:19</a>, etc.). Here the word seems to be employed, not so much to denote a foundation on which a house was to be built, as to denote strength and solidity. The elect of God are like foundationstones, which may not be moved. <span class="cmt_word">Having this seal.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a> the twelve foundationstones of the new Jerusalem were each inscribed with the name of an apostle. In like manner there are inscriptions, of the nature of seals, on God's strong foundations, showing their immutable condition. One is, "THE LORD KNOWETH THEM THAT ARE HIS," taken <span class="accented">verbatim</span> from the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-5.htm">Numbers 16:5</a>: the other is, "LET EVERY ONE THAT NAMETH THE NAME OF THE LORD DEPART FROM UNRIGHTEOUSNESS," This is nowhere to be found in the Old Testament. The first part of the verse is indeed equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-13.htm">Isaiah 26:13</a>, but there is nothing to answer to the second part. The passages quoted by commentators from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-26.htm">Numbers 16:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-11.htm">Isaiah 52:11</a> are far too general to indicate any particular reference. Possibly the motto is one of those "faithful sayings" before referred to. The two inscriptions, taken together, show the two sides of the Christian standing - God's election, and man's holiness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7, 8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:14-21 Those disposed to strive, commonly strive about matters of small moment. But strifes of words destroy the things of God. The apostle mentions some who erred. They did not deny the resurrection, but they corrupted that true doctrine. Yet nothing can be so foolish or erroneous, but it will overturn the temporary faith of some professors. This foundation has two writings on it. One speaks our comfort. None can overthrow the faith of any whom God hath chosen. The other speaks our duty. Those who would have the comfort of the privilege, must make conscience of the duty Christ gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, Tit 2:14. The church of Christ is like a dwelling: some furniture is of great value; some of smaller value, and put to meaner uses. Some professors of religion are like vessels of wood and earth. When the vessels of dishonour are cast out to be destroyed, the others will be filled with all the fulness of God. We must see to it that we are holy vessels. Every one in the church whom God approves, will be devoted to his Master's service, and thus fitted for his use.</body></html>
