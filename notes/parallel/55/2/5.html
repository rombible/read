An athlete is chosen to represent the professed servant of Christ, one of those who, after long and careful training, contends in the public games, then so popular, so entirely a part of the life of every city--in the games of wrestling or running, or in the chariot-racing, or in the hand-to-hand contests. Again, this one--as in the case of the soldier--if he aspired to victory and success, must "endure hardness."<p><span class= "bld">Except he strive lawfully.</span>--"Lawfully"--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span> according to the prescribed conditions of the contest. He must, of course, submit himself to the strict rules of the theatre where the games are held, and (for this is also included in the "lawfully") must besides--if he hopes for a prize--go through all the long and severe training and discipline necessary before engaging in such a contest. Galen uses the same phrase, in the sense of complying with the recognised rules of training as regarding diet.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="accented">Also a man</span> for <span class="accented">a man also</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">contend in the games</span> for <span class="accented">strive for masteries</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">he is not</span> for <span class="accented">yet is he not</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">have contended</span> for <span class="accented">strive</span>, A.V. Contend in the games (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;</span>); only here in the New Testament, and not found in the LXX., but common in classical Greek. It means "to contend for <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> the prize, to be an "athlete." This is also the meaning of the A.V. "strive for masteries." "To strive," means properly to contend with an antagonist, and "mastery" is an old English word for "superiority," "victory," or the like. Dryden has "mastership" in the same sense - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"When noble youths for mastership should strive,<br />To quoit, to run, and steeds and chariots drive."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Ovid., 'Met,' bk. 1.</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Lawfully</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-8.htm">1 Timothy 1:8</a>); according to the laws and usages of the games. So Timothy must conform to the laws of the Christian warfare, and not shrink from afflictions, if he would gain the great Christian prize. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 As our trials increase, we need to grow stronger in that which is good; our faith stronger, our resolution stronger, our love to God and Christ stronger. This is opposed to our being strong in our own strength. All Christians, but especially ministers, must be faithful to their Captain, and resolute in his cause. The great care of a Christian must be to please Christ. We are to strive to get the mastery of our lusts and corruptions, but we cannot expect the prize unless we observe the laws. We must take care that we do good in a right manner, that our good may not be spoken evil of. Some who are active, spend their zeal about outward forms and doubtful disputations. But those who strive lawfully shall be crowned at last. If we would partake the fruits, we must labour; if we would gain the prize, we must run the race. We must do the will of God, before we receive the promises, for which reason we have need of patience. Together with our prayers for others, that the Lord would give them understanding in all things, we must exhort and stir them up to consider what they hear or read.</body></html>
