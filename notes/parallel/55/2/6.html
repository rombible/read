"The husbandman that laboureth"--with an emphasis upon "that laboureth"--is the successful tiller of the ground; "the <span class= "ital">labouring</span> husbandman" it is, for whom the earth brings forth her increase. It is the enduring, patient, self-sacrificing toil that is rewarded in the affairs of common life--the man that "endures hardness," whether as a soldier, or athlete, or tiller of the ground, wins the reward; and as in the world, so in religion. Further on in the Epistle the Apostle speaks of <span class= "ital">his</span> having won the crown of righteousness. <span class= "ital">He</span> had <span class= "ital">endured hardness</span> of every conceivable kind; every affliction for the Lord's sake he had endured save death, and <span class= "ital">that</span> he was expecting, and knew it could not long tarry. The teaching of St. Paul in this triple picture is--not <span class= "ital">every</span> soldier wins its commander's applause, but only the veteran who devotes himself heart and soul to his profession; not <span class= "ital">every</span> athlete wins the crown or prize, but only he who trains with anxious, painful care; not <span class= "ital">every</span> tiller of the ground gathers the earth's fruits, but only the patient toiler. So must it be in religious life. It is not enough to <span class= "ital">say</span> we are Christians, or even to <span class= "ital">wish</span> to be of the brotherhood of Christ. Men must really <span class= "ital">live</span> the life they say they love.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="accented">The first to partake</span> for <span class="accented">first partaker</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">That laboureth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>). Let not Timothy think to shirk labour and yet enjoy its fruits. (For <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span>, see note on 1 Timothy 5:17.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 As our trials increase, we need to grow stronger in that which is good; our faith stronger, our resolution stronger, our love to God and Christ stronger. This is opposed to our being strong in our own strength. All Christians, but especially ministers, must be faithful to their Captain, and resolute in his cause. The great care of a Christian must be to please Christ. We are to strive to get the mastery of our lusts and corruptions, but we cannot expect the prize unless we observe the laws. We must take care that we do good in a right manner, that our good may not be spoken evil of. Some who are active, spend their zeal about outward forms and doubtful disputations. But those who strive lawfully shall be crowned at last. If we would partake the fruits, we must labour; if we would gain the prize, we must run the race. We must do the will of God, before we receive the promises, for which reason we have need of patience. Together with our prayers for others, that the Lord would give them understanding in all things, we must exhort and stir them up to consider what they hear or read.</body></html>
