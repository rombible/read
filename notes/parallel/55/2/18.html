Grace be with you. Amen.">1Timothy 6:21</a>.)<p>The resurrection of the body, grounded upon the Lord's own words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/5-28.htm" title="Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,">John 5:28-29</a>), was one of the Articles of the Christian faith upon which St. Paul especially loved to dwell. (See, for instance, his words before Felix--<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-15.htm" title="And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.">Acts 24:15</a>.) With this "resurrection of the body" St. Paul, prompted by the Holy Ghost, taught men that the future state of rewards and punishments was intimately bound up; the soul will be clothed with a body of glory or with a body of shame, according to the deeds done in the flesh. This doctrine appears, in very early times, to have been questioned by some in the Christian community. Then, as now, was the thought repugnant to the shrinking soul of man,--that the body in which he then lived and sinned would rise again.<p>Elaborated, but still scarcely disguised, the same denial of a bodily resurrection was a characteristic of the more important of the widely-spread Gnostic systems of the second and third centuries.<p>These early Christian followers of men like Hymenaeus and Philetus had much in common with the ascetic Jewish sects of Essenes and Therapeutae, and especially with the famous Sadducean school, which attracted then so many cultured and wealthy Jews. They opposed, to use Van Oosterzee's words, "their own sickly idealism to St. Paul's strong and healthy realism." Death and resurrection, with these early opponents of St. Paul, were terms which had only a spiritual meaning and application. As Waterland puts it, "They allegorised away the doctrine, and turned all into figures and metaphors."<p>Another consideration must not be lost sight of when we are considering the reasons for St. Paul's fiery indignation with this unhappy school of dreamers. In attacking, with their thinly-veiled scepticism, the great doctrine of the resurrection of the body, in pushing aside the glorious hope, they touched with their impious hands the corner-stone of all Christian belief--<span class= "ital">the resurrection in the body of the Redeemer. This</span> Resurrection was indeed past already.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="accented">Men who</span> for <span class="accented">who</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Have erred</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-6.htm">1 Timothy 1:6</a> (note) and 1 Tim 6:21.

It is remarkable that it was the subject of the resurrection which was so misunderstood in both cases. The heretics to whom St. Paul here alludes probably explained away the resurrection, as the Gnostics in the time of Irenaeus and Tertullian did (Huther), by spiritualizing it in the sense of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>, etc. It is the usual way with heresy to corrupt and destroy the gospel, under pretence of improving it. And there are always some weak brethren ready to be deceived and misled.

But strifes of words destroy the things of God. The apostle mentions some who erred. They did not deny the resurrection, but they corrupted that true doctrine. Yet nothing can be so foolish or erroneous, but it will overturn the temporary faith of some professors. This foundation has two writings on it. One speaks our comfort. None can overthrow the faith of any whom God hath chosen. The other speaks our duty. Those who would have the comfort of the privilege, must make conscience of the duty Christ gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, Tit 2:14. The church of Christ is like a dwelling: some furniture is of great value; some of smaller value, and put to meaner uses. Some professors of religion are like vessels of wood and earth. When the vessels of dishonour are cast out to be destroyed, the others will be filled with all the fulness of God. We must see to it that we are holy vessels. Every one in the church whom God approves, will be devoted to his Master's service, and thus fitted for his use.</body></html>
