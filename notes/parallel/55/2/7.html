Theophylact suggested because the preceding exhortations were in the form of metaphors, "he spake all things in an enigmatical form:" but surely these metaphors were the reverse of obscure, and did not seem to need for their comprehension any special enlightenment; if then we refer the words of this verse exclusively to what precedes, it will be best to understand the charge of St. Paul, "Consider what I say," &c., as directing Timothy's attention to the <span class= "ital">personal</span> application of each of the pictures, or metaphors. It seems, however, that the words "Consider," &c., while referring to what he <span class= "ital">had</span> said, belong also to the far weightier words he was about to write in the next sentence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-8.htm" title="Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:">2Timothy 2:8</a>). He is in this chapter exhorting Timothy to be strong in the faith in the face of many troubles. He has instanced to him earthly examples to show how success, even <span class= "ital">here, </span>depends on enduring perseverance, and is now passing on to set before him other and far higher inducements for him "to be strong;" and between the first set of arguments and the second he bids him "Consider what I say" (part has been said, but yet other and deeper things are to follow). God will five him power to grasp their meaning in all their depth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="accented">For the Lord shall give</span> for <span class="accented">and the Lord give</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Consider what I say. The</span> apostle's lessons had been given in parables or similitudes. He therefore begs Timothy to note them well, lest the application to himself should escape him, suggesting further that he should seek the necessary wisdom and understanding from God. So our Lord, at the end of the parables recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13.htm">Matthew 13</a>, says to his disciples in ver. 51, "Have ye understood all these things?" and elsewhere, "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear." <span class="cmt_word">Understanding</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); one of the special gifts of the Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, LXX.; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 As our trials increase, we need to grow stronger in that which is good; our faith stronger, our resolution stronger, our love to God and Christ stronger. This is opposed to our being strong in our own strength. All Christians, but especially ministers, must be faithful to their Captain, and resolute in his cause. The great care of a Christian must be to please Christ. We are to strive to get the mastery of our lusts and corruptions, but we cannot expect the prize unless we observe the laws. We must take care that we do good in a right manner, that our good may not be spoken evil of. Some who are active, spend their zeal about outward forms and doubtful disputations. But those who strive lawfully shall be crowned at last. If we would partake the fruits, we must labour; if we would gain the prize, we must run the race. We must do the will of God, before we receive the promises, for which reason we have need of patience. Together with our prayers for others, that the Lord would give them understanding in all things, we must exhort and stir them up to consider what they hear or read.</body></html>
