There was an <span class= "ital">inner</span> work to be accomplished, as well as an outer and more public protest to be made. He must fight with and conquer those lusts, passions, and desires which are more peculiarly tempting to those who are still in the meridian of life. That Timothy was not now in early manhood has been already shown. He was at this time, probably, between thirty and forty years of age. These youthful lusts are by no means to be limited to those varied and fatal excesses summed up in the Seventh Commandment. A victory over these, of course, is imperatively necessary for one who would be "of use" in the house of his God: but such a one must train himself to subdue other and far more subtle lusts than are included in these. He must be watchful and stamp down all covetousness, whether of rank or gold; all longing for empty shows; all pride, conceit, readiness to take offence; all the kindred forms of love of self.<p><span class= "bld">But follow righteousness, faith, charity.</span> See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-11.htm" title="But you, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.">1Timothy 6:11</a>, where the same charge occurs.<p><span class= "bld">Peace.</span>--This last, "peace," must be joined with the words immediately following: "with them that call on the Lord," &c. The "peace" here signifies absence of contention: it is well paraphrased by, "that spiritual concord which unites together all who call upon and who love their Lord," Theodoret thus draws a distinction between "love" and "peace":--"It is possible <span class= "ital">to love</span> all, and this the gospel law enjoins us in the words, 'Love your enemies:' but <span class= "ital">to be at peace</span> with all is not possible." The words "out of a pure heart" contrast those holy and humble men of heart who servo God without any ulterior motive, with those false teachers who dare to make their religion a gain, a source of profit.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="accented">But flee for flee also</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and follow after</span> for <span class="accented">but follow</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">love</span> for <span class="accented">charity</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Youthful</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>); of or belonging to <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, young men; "cupiditates adolescentiae" (Tacit., 'Hist.,' 1:15).

Lusts (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) include, besides the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>, all those ill-regulated passions to which youth is peculiarly liable, such as intem perance, love of company, arrogance, petulance, ambition, love of display, levity, vehemence of action, wilfulness, and the like. Timothy at this time was probably under forty (see note on q Timothy 4:12, and Ellicott on ditto). <span class="cmt_word">Follow after</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>); as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-11.htm">1 Timothy 6:11</a>, where, as here, it is in contrast with <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;</span>.

"With them" may mean either pursue righteousness, etc., in partnership with all who call upon the Lord; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> make the pursuit of righteousness, etc., your pursuit, as it is that of all who call upon the Lord; or it may be construed with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, so as to limit the exhortation to peace to those who call upon the Lord, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> "peace with those that call," etc., which is the construction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>. It is, however, remarkable that in both these passages, which are referred to for the <span class="accented">grammar</span>, the inference from the <span class="accented">doctrine</span> goes rather the other way, as they teach "peace with all men." So does the balance of the sentence here. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:22-26 The more we follow that which is good, the faster and the further we shall flee from that which is evil. The keeping up the communion of saints, will take us from fellowship with unfruitful works of darkness. See how often the apostle cautions against disputes in religion; which surely shows that religion consists more in believing and practising what God requires, than in subtle disputes. Those are unapt to teach, who are apt to strive, and are fierce and froward. Teaching, not persecution, is the Scripture method of dealing with those in error. The same God who gives the discovery of the truth, by his grace brings us to acknowledge it, otherwise our hearts would continue to rebel against it. There is no peradventure, in respect of God's pardoning those who do repent; but we cannot tell that he will give repentance to those who oppose his will. Sinners are taken in a snare, and in the worst snare, because it is the devil's; they are slaves to him. And if any long for deliverance, let them remember they never can escape, except by repentance, which is the gift of God; and we must ask it of him by earnest, persevering prayer.</body></html>
