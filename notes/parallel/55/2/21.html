If <span class= "ital">he</span> would separate from all that was evil in his Church at Ephesus, then would he indeed be one of those golden vessels unto honour. The image of the great house, and its many and varied vessels, though still not quite lost sight of, is passing out of sight. This verse changes into a note of direct exhortation. The good and faithful must separate themselves from the evil and faithless. The thought of those deniers of the resurrection of the body was uppermost in St. Paul's mind. There must, as it has been well said, be no communion on the part of God's servants with impugners of fundamentals. It was imperatively necessary for Timothy--and, by implication, for all members of Christ's Church--if they aimed at becoming vessels for honour in the great Temple, to break off from all Church fellowship, from all intimate friendship, with those above referred to under the image of wooden or earthen vessels.<p><span class= "bld">He shall be a vessel unto honour.</span>--Chrysostom's note upon these words is somewhat remarkable. He points out the possibility of the vessel for dishonour becoming a vessel for honour, and the reverse; and refers to St. Paul, once an earthen vessel, who became a vessel of gold, and to the traitor Judas, who, on the other hand, from being a vessel of gold became an earthen vessel.<p><span class= "bld">Meet for the master's use.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">useful for the master</span> (of the house). "Useful," as the next sentence shows us, through those good works by means of which others' needs are ministered to, and the salvation of others is furthered, and the glory of God is increased.<p><span class= "bld">Prepared unto every good work.</span>--"Prepared"--that is, ready to take advantage of any opportunity which may offer itself to do a generous, noble action. So, too, Chrysostom, who would have the "vessel unto honour" ready for every emergency which would enhance the glory of the Lord--ready even for death, or (any painful) witness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="accented">Meet</span> for <span class="accented">and meet</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">prepared</span> for <span class="accented">and prepared</span>, A.V. Purge himself from these (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x1fc3;</span>); stronger than the simple <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x1fc3;</span>, "thoroughly purge himself," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a> (the only other place in the New Testament where it occurs) and as in classical Greek. It is used also by the LXX. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-4.htm">Judges 7:4</a>, as the rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>, to try metals. The idea, therefore, seems to be that of <span class="accented">separation</span>, and, if so, "from these" may certainly mean from the false teachers described under the image of the vessels unto dishonour, as usually explained. At the same time, the image is better sustained if we understand "from these" to mean the babblings, and ungodliness, and eating words of the heretics denounced. It is hardly natural to imply that one vessel in the house will become a golden vessel by purging itself from the wooden and earthen vessels. Neither is separation from the false teachers the point which St. Paul is here pressing, but avoidance of false doctrines. <span class="cmt_word">Meet for...use</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); only here and ch. 4:11 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-11.htm">Philemon 1:11</a>.

But strifes of words destroy the things of God. The apostle mentions some who erred. They did not deny the resurrection, but they corrupted that true doctrine. Yet nothing can be so foolish or erroneous, but it will overturn the temporary faith of some professors. This foundation has two writings on it. One speaks our comfort. None can overthrow the faith of any whom God hath chosen. The other speaks our duty. Those who would have the comfort of the privilege, must make conscience of the duty Christ gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, Tit 2:14. The church of Christ is like a dwelling: some furniture is of great value; some of smaller value, and put to meaner uses. Some professors of religion are like vessels of wood and earth. When the vessels of dishonour are cast out to be destroyed, the others will be filled with all the fulness of God. We must see to it that we are holy vessels. Every one in the church whom God approves, will be devoted to his Master's service, and thus fitted for his use.</body></html>
