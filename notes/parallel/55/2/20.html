He has been speaking of this Church as the "foundation-storey that cannot be moved" of a still more glorious edifice. He now, as it were, answers a question which would naturally occur to Timothy and to many a devout reader or hearer of the Epistle when they came to this part of the argument. How comes it, then, one would ask, that in this visible Church on earth are so many unworthy members? How is it that in this changeless, abiding foundation of the great Temple of the future, against which all earthly storms may beat, and yet never shake its massive storeys, so many useless crumbling stones are taken for the building?<p><span class= "bld">In a great house, argues St. Paul</span>--still thinking of the Church, but changing the foundation image for that of a great house--are always found two distinct kinds of vessels--the precious and enduring, and also the comparatively valueless and lasting for out a little while; the first kind are destined for honour, the second for dishonour. In St. Paul's mind, when he wrote these words, the natural sequel to his far-reaching and suggestive comparison of the "foundation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-19.htm" title="Nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, The Lord knows them that are his. And, Let every one that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.">2Timothy 2:19</a>) were the words of his Master, who had once compared His Church to a drag-net of wide sweep, including in its take something of every kind out of the vast sea-world. The "net"--His Church--was together and to hold in its meshes its great take--the good and the bad, the useful and the useless--<span class= "ital">till the end of the world.</span> So St. Paul writes how in a great house there must be these varieties of vessels--some for honour, others for dishonour. By these vessels the genuine and spurious members of the Church are represented as forming two distinct classes; and in these classes different degrees of honour and dishonour besides exist--the vessels of gold and silver, the vessels of wood and of earth. To Timothy these comparisons would at once suggest the true and false teachers in his Church at Ephesus; but the reference is a far broader one, and includes <span class= "ital">all</span> members of the Church of Christ. The enduring nature of the metals gold and silver are contrasted with the perishable nature of the other materials, wood and earth. The former will remain a part of the Church for ever; the latter will only endure until the end of the world.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="accented">Now</span> for <span class="accented">but</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">unto</span> for <span class="accented">to</span>, A.V. (twice). <span class="cmt_word">Now in a great house,</span> etc. "Now" is hardly the right conjunction. It should rather be "howbeit." The object of the figure of the various vessels in the "great house" is to show that, though every one that names the Name of the Lord <span class="accented">ought</span> to depart from unrighteousness, yet we must not be surprised if it is not so, and if there are found in the Church some professing Christians whose practice is quite inconsistent with their profession. Perhaps even the vilest members of the visible Church perform some useful function, howbeit they do not mean it. With this mention of the vessels, compare the enumeration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-12.htm">1 Corinthians 3:12</a>. Of earth (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>); only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>, where it is also applied to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;</span>, "earthen vessels;" as it is in the LXX., <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-28.htm">Leviticus 6:28</a>; and to <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-17.htm">Numbers 5:17</a>). <span class="greek">&#x1f4c;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> "a tile."

But strifes of words destroy the things of God. The apostle mentions some who erred. They did not deny the resurrection, but they corrupted that true doctrine. Yet nothing can be so foolish or erroneous, but it will overturn the temporary faith of some professors. This foundation has two writings on it. One speaks our comfort. None can overthrow the faith of any whom God hath chosen. The other speaks our duty. Those who would have the comfort of the privilege, must make conscience of the duty Christ gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, Tit 2:14. The church of Christ is like a dwelling: some furniture is of great value; some of smaller value, and put to meaner uses. Some professors of religion are like vessels of wood and earth. When the vessels of dishonour are cast out to be destroyed, the others will be filled with all the fulness of God. We must see to it that we are holy vessels. Every one in the church whom God approves, will be devoted to his Master's service, and thus fitted for his use.</body></html>
