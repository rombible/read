It is as though he said, Imitate the one loyal follower, and make up to me for the faithless conduct of so many false friends. "Thou, then, be strong," but not as men understand strength or firmness; but do thou be strong "in the grace that is in Christ Jesus"--that is, be strong in the power of that inward sanctification which enables a man to will and to do according to what God has commanded, in the power of that inward sanctification which alone proceeds from Christ, and which will never be wanting to any one who is in Christ; in other words, "Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-10.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.">Ephesians 6:10</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="accented">Child</span> for <span class="accented">son</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">strengthened</span> for <span class="accented">strong</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Be strengthened</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); more exactly (as Huther), <span class="accented">become strong</span>, or, which is the same thing, <span class="accented">strengthen thyself</span>; implying, perhaps, though gently expressed, some previous weakness, as m <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-34.htm">Hebrews 11:34</a>, "From weakness were made strong;" where the image seems to be that of recovery from sickness. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10</a>, however (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>), there is no evidence of preceding weakness, but only a call to use the strength they had; and it may be so here too. The strength, Timothy is reminded, by which he was to fight the good fight, was not his own, but that which would come to him from the grace and love of Jesus Christ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 As our trials increase, we need to grow stronger in that which is good; our faith stronger, our resolution stronger, our love to God and Christ stronger. This is opposed to our being strong in our own strength. All Christians, but especially ministers, must be faithful to their Captain, and resolute in his cause. The great care of a Christian must be to please Christ. We are to strive to get the mastery of our lusts and corruptions, but we cannot expect the prize unless we observe the laws. We must take care that we do good in a right manner, that our good may not be spoken evil of. Some who are active, spend their zeal about outward forms and doubtful disputations. But those who strive lawfully shall be crowned at last. If we would partake the fruits, we must labour; if we would gain the prize, we must run the race. We must do the will of God, before we receive the promises, for which reason we have need of patience. Together with our prayers for others, that the Lord would give them understanding in all things, we must exhort and stir them up to consider what they hear or read.</body></html>
