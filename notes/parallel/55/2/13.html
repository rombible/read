The faithlessness implies more than mere unbelief in any of the fundamental doctrines of the faith, such as the Resurrection of the Lord or His divinity.<p><span class= "bld">Yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</span>--Those who have understood these words as containing soothing, comforting voices for the sinner, for the faithless Christian who has left his first love, are gravely mistaken. The passage is one of distinct severity--may even be termed one of the sternest in the Book of Life; for it tells how it is impossible even for the pitiful Redeemer to forgive in the future life. "He cannot deny Himself"--cannot treat the faithless as though he were faithful--cannot act as though faithfulness and faithlessness were one and the same thing. The Christian teacher, such as Timothy, and the members of his flock likewise, must remember that, sure and certain as are the promises of glory and happiness to those who love the Lord and try to live His life, so surely will fall the chastisement on all who are faithless and untrue.<p>With the solemn words of this "faithful saying" St. Paul closes this, the second division of his Epistle--fellowship in the sufferings of Christ <span class= "ital">here, </span>on this side the grave, and fellowship in the glory of Christ <span class= "ital">there, </span>on the other side the grave--the one side was the sure consequence of the other; the one could not exist without the other.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="accented">Are faithless</span> for <span class="accented">believe not.</span> A.V.; <span class="accented">he</span> for <span class="accented">yet he</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">for he</span> for <span class="accented">he</span>, A.V. and T.B. <span class="cmt_word">Are faithless</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); meaning the same as the A.V. <span class="accented">believe not</span>, which is everywhere in the New Testament the sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-11.htm">Mark 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-11.htm">Luke 24:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-3.htm">Romans 3:3</a>, etc.).

This and the two preceding couplets in vers. 11 and 12 make up "the faithful saying" spoken of in ver. 11 (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-15.htm">1 Timothy 1:15</a>, note). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-13 Let suffering saints remember, and look to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of their faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despised the shame, and is now set down at the right hand of the throne of God. We must not think it strange if the best men meet with the worst treatment; but this is cheering, that the word of God is not bound. Here we see the real and true cause of the apostle's suffering trouble in, or for, the sake of the gospel. If we are dead to this world, its pleasures, profits, and honours, we shall be for ever with Christ in a better world. He is faithful to his threatenings, and faithful to his promises. This truth makes sure the unbeliever's condemnation, and the believer's salvation.</body></html>
