How, it seems to ask, can a believer in Christ shrink from suffering, when he knows what to him will be the glorious consequences of this present suffering? The word rendered "suffer" would be better translated, <span class= "ital">if we endure</span>--that is, if we bravely bear up against sufferings for His sake, and all the while work on with hand and brain for Him and for our brother as best we can. If we do this in this life, we shall, in the life to come, reign with Him--more than merely <span class= "ital">live</span> with Him, as the last verse told us: we shall even "be kings with Him." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-17.htm" title="For if by one man's offense death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)">Romans 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-6.htm" title="And has made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.">Revelation 1:6</a>, where Jesus Christ is especially spoken of as having made us "kings.") The promise thus woven into the faithful saying, and repeated in these several passages, of the "reign of the saints in Christ," gives us a strangely glorious hope--a marvellous on-look, concerning the active and personal work which Christ's redeemed will be intrusted with in the ages of eternity.<p><span class= "bld">If we deny him, he also will deny us.</span>--But there is another side to the words of the Blessed. While to the faithful and the believer He will grant to sit down with Him on His throne, the faithless and unbeliever will have no share in the glories of the life to come. These grave warnings are apparently addressed rather to unfaithful members of the outward and visible Church, than to the Pagan world who have never known Christ. The words, "He also will deny us," imply something of a recognition on the part of us who are denied by Him--something of an expectation on our part that He would recognise us as friends. They are evidently an echo of the Lord's own sad reply to those many who will say to Him in that day, "Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name? . . . and then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from Me, ye that work iniquity." (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/7-22.htm" title="Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name? and in your name have cast out devils? and in your name done many wonderful works?">Matthew 7:22-23</a>.

We must not think it strange if the best men meet with the worst treatment; but this is cheering, that the word of God is not bound. Here we see the real and true cause of the apostle's suffering trouble in, or for, the sake of the gospel. If we are dead to this world, its pleasures, profits, and honours, we shall be for ever with Christ in a better world. He is faithful to his threatenings, and faithful to his promises. This truth makes sure the unbeliever's condemnation, and the believer's salvation.</body></html>
