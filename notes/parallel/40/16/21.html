They had failed to understand the mysterious hints of the future which we find in, "Destroy this temple" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-19.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.">John 2:19</a>), in the Son of Man being "lifted up" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-14.htm" title="And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:">John 3:14</a>), in the sign of the prophet "Jonas" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-39.htm" title="But he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:">Matthew 12:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-4.htm" title="A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.">Matthew 16:4</a>). Now the veil is uplifted, and the order of events is plainly foretold--the entry into Jerusalem, the rejection, the condemnation, the death, the resurrection. It is obvious that if we accept the record as true the prediction is one which implies a foreknowledge that is at least supernatural, and is so far evidence of a divine mission, if not also of a divine nature in the speaker. And it may well be urged that in this case the incidents which surround the prediction--as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> Peter's protest, and the rebuke addressed to him in such striking contrast with the previous promise--have a character of originality and unexpectedness which negatives the hypothesis of its being a prophecy after the event. On the other hand, the fact that the disciples did not take in the meaning of the prediction as to His rising from the dead may, in its turn, be pleaded in bar of the assumption that the prophecy lingered in men's minds, and suggested the belief in a mythical, in the absence of a real, fulfilment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21-ch. 25:46.</span> - SUFFERING: JESUS ACCEPTS AND DOES NOT SHUN IT. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-28.</span> - <span class="accented">Jesus announces plainly his death and resurrection.

He tells of his sufferings, and of their necessity in the order of things, so that any one who opposes this design is fighting against God; and shows how self-denial and pain must be the lot of his followers. <span class="cmt_word">Began to show unto his disciples.</span> No longer obscurely, but plainly and without reserve. He had already intimated his future sufferings, though his disciples had been slow to receive these dark hints, so opposed to all their preconceived opinions of Messiah's glory and victorious career. Such sayings as, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>); and, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14</a>), had fallen unheeded on the disciples' ears, and had not guided them to forecast the future. Even the allusions to their own trials, in the warnings about bearing the cross and following him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-38.htm">Matthew 10:38</a>), were not understood. The great point of his real nature had become clear to them; they had now to learn that the way to glory, both for him and them, led through suffering and death. Conscious of Christ's Divinity, they could now more patiently endure the mystery of his cross and Passion. <span class="cmt_word">Unto Jerusalem.</span> The appointed scene of these events (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-17.htm">Matthew 20:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He must</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">go</span> thither to meet and endure these sufferings, because it was so ordained in the counsels of God and announced by the prophets (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-54.htm">Matthew 26:54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-26.htm">Luke 24:26, 46</a>). Many things. These are detailed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-18.htm">Matthew 20:18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-31.htm">Luke 18:31-33</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Elders, chief priests, and scribes.</span> The various members of the Sanhedrin (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-4.htm">Matthew 2:4</a>). The three classes are, in Nosgen's opinion, intentionally named here - the elders, as the most aged and venerated members, or such as were distinguished by rank and character; the chief priests, heads of the twenty-four courses, as office bearers of the theocracy; and scribes, at that time occupying almost the position of the prophets. The whole religious world would thus be combined against Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Be killed.</span> He does not here say "crucified," as he did afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a>), only gradually revealing the whole awful truth. <span class="cmt_word">Be raised again the third day.</span> This announcement was intended to support the disciples in view of Christ's sufferings and death. And "the third day" is mentioned, not only for typical reasons, but to assure them that his death should be speedily followed by his return to life from the grave. It is obvious to us that Jesus prophesied plainly concerning his resurrection; but such an event, so unprecedented, so unexperienced, was not understood; and though the prediction was so far known as to cause his grave to be watched, it was only a vague kind of expectation, without form or definiteness, that was cherished, and the actual fact came as a surprise (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-10.htm">Mark 9:10, 32</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:21-23 Christ reveals his mind to his people gradually. From that time, when the apostles had made the full confession of Christ, that he was the Son of God, he began to show them of his sufferings. He spake this to set right the mistakes of his disciples about the outward pomp and power of his kingdom. Those that follow Christ, must not expect great or high things in this world. Peter would have Christ to dread suffering as much as he did; but we mistake, if we measure Christ's love and patience by our own. We do not read of any thing said or done by any of his disciples, at any time, that Christ resented so much as this. Whoever takes us from that which is good, and would make us fear to do too much for God, speaks Satan's language. Whatever appears to be a temptation to sin, must be resisted with abhorrence, and not be parleyed with. Those that decline suffering for Christ, savour more of the things of man than of the things of God.</body></html>
