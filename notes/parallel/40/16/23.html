They, we may believe, stood behind, watching the effect of the remonstrance which Peter had uttered as their spokesman, and therefore, the Lord reading their thoughts, the rebuke, though addressed to him, was spoken so that they too might hear.<p><span class= "bld">Get thee behind me, Satan.</span>--The sharpness of the words indicates a strong and intense emotion. The chief of the Apostles was addressed in the self-same terms as those which had been spoken to the Tempter (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-10.htm" title="Then said Jesus to him, Get you hence, Satan: for it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.">Matthew 4:10</a>). It was, indeed, nothing less than a renewal of the same temptation. In this suggestion, that He might gain the crown without the cross, and attain a kingdom of this world as the princes of the world obtain their kingdoms, the Christ saw the recurrence of the temptation which had offered Him the glory of those kingdoms on condition of His drawing back from the path which the Father had appointed for Him, with the associations that had gathered round its original.<p><span class= "bld">Thou art an offence unto me.</span>--The Greek word is, of course, to be taken as meaning a stumbling block, an impediment. So taken, it presents a suggestive contrast to the previous promise. Peter is still a <span class= "ital">stone,</span> but it is as "a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm" title="And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.">Isaiah 8:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-8.htm" title="And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.">1Peter 2:8</a>). He is hindering, not forwarding his Master's work. For one who loved his Lord as Peter did--his very love in this instance prompting the rash words--this was at once the sharpest and yet the tenderest, and therefore the most effective, rebuke that could have been uttered.<p><span class= "bld">Thou savourest not the things that be of God.</span>--The verb, though found in all English versions from Wiclif downwards, and suggested by the <span class= "ital">sapis</span> of the Vulgate, was never a very happy one, and is now so archaic as to be misleading. It may help us to understand it, to remember that our <span class= "ital">savour</span> and the French <span class= "ital">savoir</span> are both forms derived from the Latin <span class= "ital">sapere,</span> and that the translators were so far justified in using it to describe a mental state, or rather act. Elsewhere the word is rendered "mind," or "set affection on," as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> "<span class= "ital">mind</span> the things of the flesh," or "of the spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-5.htm" title="For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.">Romans 8:5</a>), and "<span class= "ital">set your affection</span> on things above" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-2.htm" title=" Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.">Colossians 3:2</a>); and this is obviously a more satisfactory rendering. Peter's sin lay in the fact that his mind was set on the things of earth, its outward pomp and pageantry, measuring the future by a human not a divine standard.<p>It is hardly a needless divergence from the work of mere interpretation to suggest that the weakness of Peter has been again and again reproduced in the history of Christendom at large, most conspicuously in the history of the Church which rests its claims on the greatness of the Apostle's name. The annals of the Papacy, from the colossal sovereignty, which formed the ideal of Hildebrand, down to the last struggle for temporal power, is but the record of the zeal not according to knowledge of those who "savoured not the things that be of God, but those that be of man." So far as this was so, they were working, though they knew it not, for evil and not for good, even as the chief of the Apostles when he thus became of one mind with the spirit of the world, which is also the spirit of the Tempter, placed himself for the moment on a level with the disciple whom our Lord had hinted at as a "devil," because the seeds of treachery and greed of gain were already working in his soul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-70.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?">John 6:70</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He turned</span>. Peter and the rest were following Christ, as he walked onward. Now Jesus stops, turns, and faces them. <span class="cmt_word">Get thee behind me, Satan.</span> Jesus uses nearly the same words in rebuking Peter that he had used to the devil in his temptation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-10.htm">Matthew 4:10</a>); and justly, because the apostle was acting the adversary's part, by opposing the Divine economy, and endeavouring to persuade Jesus that the way he proposed was wholly unnecessary. The lively stone has became a very Satan in opposing the Divine will; hence the sharpness of the rebuke administered to him. <span class="cmt_word">An offence unto me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">my stumbling block.</span> Petros, the stone, to maintain the metaphor, is now "a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-8.htm">1 Peter 2:8</a>). He stood in the Saviour's way, and impeded his onward progress in the course ordained. He who would turn him aside from Calvary is the enemy of man's salvation, which was to be won there. <span class="cmt_word">Thou</span> <span class="cmt_word">savourest</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">not;</span> <span class="accented">mindest not</span> (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-5.htm">Romans 8:5</a>); thy taste is not for the Divine plans, but for human considerations; thou art not promoting the great purpose of God, but worldliness and self-pleasing. "Peter," says St. Chrysostom, "examining the matter by human and earthly reasoning, accounted it disgraceful to him [Christ] and an unmeet thing. Touching him therefore sharply, he saith, 'My Passion is not an unmeet thing, but thou givest this sentence with a carnal mind; whereas if thou hadst hearkened to my sayings in a godly manner, disengaging thyself from thy carnal understanding, thou wouldst know that this of all things most becometh me. For thou indeed supposest that to suffer is unworthy of me; but I say unto thee, that for me not to suffer is of the devil's mind;' by the contrary statements repressing his alarm" (Oxford transl.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:21-23 Christ reveals his mind to his people gradually. From that time, when the apostles had made the full confession of Christ, that he was the Son of God, he began to show them of his sufferings. He spake this to set right the mistakes of his disciples about the outward pomp and power of his kingdom. Those that follow Christ, must not expect great or high things in this world. Peter would have Christ to dread suffering as much as he did; but we mistake, if we measure Christ's love and patience by our own. We do not read of any thing said or done by any of his disciples, at any time, that Christ resented so much as this. Whoever takes us from that which is good, and would make us fear to do too much for God, speaks Satan's language. Whatever appears to be a temptation to sin, must be resisted with abhorrence, and not be parleyed with. Those that decline suffering for Christ, savour more of the things of man than of the things of God.</body></html>
