It is clear, however, that we can only reach the true meaning by putting those controversies aside, at all events till we have endeavoured to realise what thoughts the words at the time actually conveyed to those who heard them, and that when we have grasped that meaning it will be our best preparation for determining what bearing they have upon the later controversies of ancient or modern times. And (1) it would seem clear that the connection between Peter and the rock (the words in the Greek differ in gender, <span class= "greekheb">??????</span> and <span class= "greekheb">?????</span>, but were identical in the Aramaic, which our Lord probably used) was meant to be brought into special prominence. Now, at last, by this confession of his faith, Peter had risen to the height of his new calling, and was worthy of his new name. (2) Whether he is to be identified with the <span class= "ital">rock</span> of the next clause is, however, a question on which men may legitimately differ. On the one side there is the probability that in the Aramaic, in which our Lord spoke, there would be no difference between the words in the two clauses; on the other, the possibility that He may have used the Greek words, or that the Evangelist may have intended to mark the distinction which he felt by the use of the two words, which undoubtedly differ in their meaning, <span class= "greekheb">??????</span> being a "stone" or fragment of rock, while <span class= "greekheb">?????</span> is the rock itself. The Aramaic <span class= "ital">Cepha,</span> it may be noted, has the former rather than the latter meaning. (3) On the assumption of a distinction there follows the question, What is the rock? Peter's faith (subjective)? or the truth (objective) which he confessed? or Christ Himself? Taking all the facts of the case, the balance seems to incline in favour of the last view. (1.) Christ and not Peter is the Rock in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-4.htm" title="And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.">1Corinthians 10:4</a>, the Foundation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-11.htm" title="For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.">1Corinthians 3:11</a>. (2.) The poetry of the Old Testament associated the idea of the Rock with the greatness and steadfastness of God, not with that of a man [<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-4.htm" title="He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-18.htm" title="Of the Rock that begat you you are unmindful, and have forgotten God that formed you.">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-3.htm" title="The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my savior; you save me from violence.">2Samuel 22:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-3.htm" title="The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me, He that rules over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.">2Samuel 23:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm" title="The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.">Psalm 18:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-31.htm" title="For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?">Psalm 18:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-46.htm" title="The LORD lives; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.">Psalm 18:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-10.htm" title="Because you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have not been mindful of the rock of your strength, therefore shall you plant pleasant plants, and shall set it with strange slips:">Isaiah 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-12.htm" title="Are you not from everlasting, O LORD my God, my Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, you have ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, you have established them for correction.">Habakkuk 1:12</a> (Hebrew)]. (3.) As with the words, which in their form present a parallel to these, "Destroy this temple" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-19.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.">John 2:19</a>), so here, we may believe the meaning to have been indicated by significant look or gesture. The Rock on which the Church was to be built was Himself, in the mystery of that union of the Divine and the Human which had been the subject of St. Peter's confession. Had Peter himself been meant, we may. add, the simpler form, "Thou art Peter, and on thee will I build My Church," would have been clearer and more natural. As it is, the collocation suggests an implied contrast: "Thou art the Rock-Apostle; and yet not <span class= "ital">the</span> Rock on which the Church is to be built. It is enough for thee to have found the Rock, and to have built on the one Foundation." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-24.htm" title="Therefore whoever hears these sayings of mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man, which built his house on a rock:">Matthew 7:24</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">I will build my church.</span>--It is significant that this is the first occurrence of the word Church (<span class= "ital">Ecclesia</span>) in the New Testament, the only passage but one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-17.htm" title="And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it to the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be to you as an heathen man and a publican.">Matthew 18:17</a>) in which it is found in the whole cycle of our Lord's recorded teaching. Its use was every way significant. Partly, doubtless, it came with the associations which it had in the Greek of the Old Testament, as used for the "assembly" or "congregation" of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-16.htm" title="According to all that you desired of the LORD your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.">Deuteronomy 18:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-1.htm" title="He that is wounded in the stones, or has his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.">Deuteronomy 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-12.htm" title="My foot stands in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.">Psalm 26:12</a>); but partly also, as soon at least as the word came in its Greek form before Greek readers, it would bring with it the associations of Greek politics. The <span class= "ital">Ecclesia</span> was the assembly of free citizens, to which belonged judicial and legislative power, and from which aliens and slaves were alike excluded. The mere use of the term was accordingly a momentous step in the education of the disciples. They had been looking for a kingdom with the King, as its visible Head, sitting on an earthly throne. They were told that it was to be realised in a society, an assembly, like those which in earthly polities we call popular or democratic. He, the King, claimed that society as His own. He was its real Head and Founder; but, outwardly, it was to be what the word which He now chose described. And this Church He was about to build. It need hardly be said that the word <span class= "ital">ecclesia</span> did not lend itself so readily as the English equivalent does to the idea of building. The society and the fabric in which the members of the society meet were not then, as they are now, described by the same term. The similitude was bolder than it seems to us. Like the "city set on a hill" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-14.htm" title="You are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.">Matthew 5:14</a>, like the "vine" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-1.htm" title="I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer.">John 15:1</a>, it may well have been suggested by the scenery in the midst of which the words were uttered. For there upon one rock rose the ruins of the old Canaanite city of Hazor; and on another the stately palace built by the Herodian princes, and still, as the Castle of Shubeibeh, covering an extent of ground equal to that occupied by the Castle of Heidelberg (Stanley's <span class= "ital">Sinai and Palestine,</span> c. 11). Once started on its way, the similitude became the fruitful source of new thoughts and phrases. The <span class= "ital">ecclesia</span> was the "house of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-15.htm" title="But if I tarry long, that you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.">1Timothy 3:15</a>); it was a "holy temple" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-21.htm" title="In whom all the building fitly framed together grows to an holy temple in the Lord:">Ephesians 2:21</a>). All gifts were bestowed for the work of "edifying" or building it up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-3.htm" title="But he that prophesies speaks to men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.">1Corinthians 14:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-12.htm" title="For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:">Ephesians 4:12</a>). Those who laboured in that work were as "wise architects or master builders" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-10.htm" title="According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds thereon. But let every man take heed how he builds thereupon.">1Corinthians 3:10</a>). But Christ, we must remember, claims the work of building as His own. Whatever others may do, He is the supreme Master-builder. As in His sacerdotal character, He is at once Priest and Victim, so under the aspect now presented (consistency of metaphors giving way to the necessities of spiritual truth) He is at once the Founder and the Foundation of the new society.<p><span class= "bld">The gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</span>--The gates of <span class= "ital">Hades</span> (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-23.htm" title="And you, Capernaum, which are exalted to heaven, shall be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in you, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.">Matthew 11:23</a>), not of Gehenna, the place of torment. Hades as the shadow-world of the dead, the unseen counterpart of the visible grave, all-absorbing, all-destructive, into whose jaws or gates all things human pass, and from which issue all forces that destroy, is half-idealised, half-personified, as a power, or polity of death. The very phrase, "gates of the grave, or of Hades," meets us in Hezekiah's elegy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-10.htm" title="I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.">Isaiah 38:10</a>), and <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/16-13.htm" title="For thou hast power of life and death: thou leadest to the gates of hell, and bringest up again.">Wisdom Of Solomon 16:13</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-8.htm" title="And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given to them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.">Revelation 6:8</a> the personification is carried still further, and Death rides upon a pale horse, and Hades follows after him, and both are in the end overthrown and cast into the lake of fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-14.htm" title="And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.">Revelation 20:14</a>). And as the gates of the Eastern city were the scene at once of kingly judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-2.htm" title="And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, Of what city are you? And he said, Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.">2Samuel 15:2</a>) and of the council of the elders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-23.htm" title="Her husband is known in the gates, when he sits among the elders of the land.">Proverbs 31:23</a>), they became the natural symbol of the polity which ruled there. And so the promise declared that all the powers of Hades, all the forces of destruction that attack and in the long run overpower other societies, should attack, but not overpower, the <span class= "ital">ecclesia</span> of which Christ was the Founder. Nothing in our Lord's teaching is, as measured by man's judgment, more wonderful than the utterance of such a prophecy at such a time. It was, as has been said, a time of seeming failure. He was about to announce, with a clearness unknown before, His coming death as a malefactor, and yet it was at this moment that He proclaimed the perpetuity and triumph of the society which as yet, it may be said, existed only in the germs of a half-realised conception. The history of the world offers hardly any serious parallel to such a prediction, and still less to that fulfilment of it which has been witnessed through eighteen centuries of Christendom, and which does not as yet seem drawing to its close.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I say also</span> (<span class="accented">I also say</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee.</span> As thou hast said unto me, "Thou art the Christ," so I say unto thee, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Thou art Peter</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">Petrus</span>), and upon this <span class="cmt_word">rock</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">petra</span>) <span class="cmt_word">I will build my Church.</span> In classical Greek, the distinction between <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is well known - the former meaning "a rock," the latter "a piece of rock," or "a stone." But probably no such distinction is intended here, as there would be none in Aramaic. There is plainly a paronomasia here in the Greek; and, if our Lord spoke in Aramaic, the same play of words was exhibited in <span class="accented">Kephas</span> or <span class="accented">kepha.</span> When Jesus first called Peter to be a disciple, he imposed upon him the name <span class="accented">Cephas</span>, which the evangelist explains to be <span class="accented">Peter</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-42.htm">John 1:42</a>). The name was bestowed in anticipation of Peter's great confession: "Thou shalt be called." This preannouncement was here fulfilled and confirmed. Upon this passage chiefly the claims of the Roman Church, which for fifteen centuries have been the subject of acrimonious controversy, are founded. It is hence assumed that the Christian Church is founded upon Peter and his successors, and that these successors are the Bishops of Rome. The latter assertion may be left to the decision of history, which fails to <span class="accented">prove</span> that Peter was ever at Rome, or that he transmitted his supposed supremacy to the episcopate of that city. We have in this place to deal with the former assertion. Who or what is the <span class="accented">rock</span> on which Christ says that he will hereafter build his Church? French Romanists consider it a providential coincidence that they can translate the passage, "Je te disque, Tu es Pierre; et sur cette pierre je batirai," etc.; but persons outside the papal communion are not satisfied to hang their faith on a play of words. The early Fathers are by no means at one in their explanations of the paragraph. Living before Rome had laid claim to the tremendous privileges which it afterwards affected, they did not regard the statement in the light of later controversies; and even those who held Peter to be the rock would have indignantly repelled the assumptions which have been built on that interpretation. The apostolic Fathers seem to have mentioned the passage in none of their writings; and they could scarcely have failed to refer to it had they been aware of the tremendous issues dependent thereon. It was embodied in no Catholic Creed, and never made an article of the Christian faith. We may remark also that of the evangelists St. Matthew alone records the promise to Peter; Mark and Luke give his confession, which was the one point which Christ desired to elicit, and omit that which is considered to concern his privileges. This looks as though, in their view, the chief aim of the passage was not Peter, but Christ; not Peter's pre-eminence, but Christ's nature and office. At the same time, to deny all allusion to Peter in the "rock" is quite contrary to the genius of the language and to New Testament usage, and would not have been so pressed in modern times except for polemical purposes. Three views have been held on the interpretation of this passage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That Christ himself is the Rock on which the Church should be built. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That Peter's confession of Jesus Christ as Son of God, or God incarnate, is the Rock. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That St. Peter is the rock. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The first explanation is supported by passages where in Christ speaks of himself in the third person, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "Destroy this temple;" "If any man eat of this bread; Whoso falleth on this stone," etc. In the same sense are cited the words of Isaiah (Isaiah 28:16), "Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation." Almighty God is continually called "a Rock" in the Old Testament (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-32.htm">2 Samuel 22:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-31.htm">Psalm 18:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2, 6, 7</a>, etc.), so that it might be deemed natural and intelligible for Christ to call himself "this Rock," in accordance, with the words of St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>), "Other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), which is Jesus Christ." But then the reference to Peter becomes unmeaning: "Thou art Peter, and upon myself I will build my Church." It is true that some few eminent authorities have taken this view. Thus St. Augustine writes, "It was not said to him, 'Thou art a rock (<span class="accented">petra</span>),' but, 'Thou art Peter,' and the Rock was Christ" ('Retract.,' 1:21). And commentators have imagined that Christ pointed to himself as he spoke. In such surmises there is an inherent improbability, and they do not explain the commencement of the address. In saying, "Thou art Peter," Christ, if he made any gesture at all, would have touched or turned to that apostle. Immediately after this to have directed attention to himself would have been most unnatural and contradictory. We may safely surrender the interpretation which regards Christ himself as the Rock. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The explanation which finds the rock in Peter's great confession has been widely adopted by commentators ancient and modern. Thus St. Chrysostom, "Upon this rock, that is, on the faith of his confession. Hereby he signifies that many were now on the point of believing, and raises his spirit, and makes him a shepherd." To the same purport might be quoted Hilary, Ambrose, Jerome, Gregory Nyss., Cyril, and others. It is remarkable that in the Collect from the Gregorian Sacramentary and in the Roman Missal on the Vigil of St. Peter and St. Paul are found the words, "Grant that thou wouldst not suffer us, whom thou hast established on the rock of the apostolic confession (<span class="accented">quos in apostolicae confessionis petra solidasti</span>) to be shaken by any commotions." Bishop Wordsworth, as many exegetes virtually do, combines the two interpretations, and we cite his exposition as a specimen of the view thus held: "What he says is this, 'I myself, now confessed by thee to be both God and Man, am the Rock of the Church. This is the foundation on which it is built.' And because St. Peter had confessed him as such, he says to St. Peter, 'Thou hast confessed me, and I will now confess thee; thou hast owned me, I will now own thee. Thou art Peter,' <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thou art a lively <span class="accented">stone</span>, hewn out of and built upon me, the living <span class="accented">Rock.</span> Thou art a genuine <span class="accented">Petros</span> of me, the Divine <span class="accented">Petra.</span> And whosoever would be a lively stone, a <span class="accented">Peter</span>, must imitate thee in this thy true confession of me, the living <span class="accented">Rock</span>; for upon this Rock, that is, on myself, believed and confessed to be both God and Man, I will build my Church." As the opinion that Christ means himself by "this rock" is untenable, so we consider that Peter's confession is equally debarred from being the foundation intended. Who does not see that the Church is to be built, not on confessions or dogmas, but on men - men inspired by God to teach the great truth? A confession implies a confessor; it was the person who made the confession that is meant, not the mere statement itself, however momentous and true. Thus elsewhere the Church is said to have been built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>), "Ye," says St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>), "as living stones are built up a spiritual house." "James and Cephas who were reputed to be pillars" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>). In Revelation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-14.htm">Revelation 21:14</a>) the foundationstones of the heavenly temple are "the twelve apostles of the Lamb." Hence we gather that the rock is a person. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> So we come to the explanation of the difficulty which naturally is deduced from the language if considered without regard to prejudice or the pernicious use to which it has been put. Looking at the matter in a straightforward way, we come to the conclusion that Christ is wishing to reward Peter for his outspoken profession of faith; and his commendation is couched in a form which was usual in Oriental addresses, and intelligible to his hearers. "Thou hast said to me, 'Thou art the Son of God;' I say to thee, 'Thou art Peter,' a rock man, 'and on thee,' as a rock, 'I will build my Church.' "As he was the first to acknowledge Christ's nature and office, so he was rewarded by being appointed as the apostle who should inaugurate the Christian Church and lay its first foundation. His name and his work were to coincide. This promise was fulfilled in Peter's acts. He it was who took the lead on the Day of Pentecost, when at his preaching, to the hundred and twenty disciples there were added three thousand souls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a>); he it was who admitted the Gentiles to the Christian community (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>.); he it was who in these early days stood forth prominently as a master builder, and was the first to open the kingdom of heaven to Jews and Gentiles. It is objected that, if Peter was a builder, he could not be the rock on which the building was raised. The expression, of course, is metaphorical. Christ builds the Church by employing Peter as the foundation of the spiritual house; Peter's zeal and activity and stable faith are indeed the living rock which forms the material element, so to speak, of this erection; he, as labouring in the holy cause beyond all others, at any rate in the early days of the gospel, is regarded as that solid basis on which the Church was raised. Christ, in one sense, builds on Peter; Peter builds on Christ. The Church, in so far as it was visible, had Peter for its rocky foundation; in so far as it was spiritual, it was founded on Christ. The distinction thus accorded in the future to Peter was personal, and carried with it none of the consequences which human ambition or mistaken pursuit of unity have elicited therefrom. There was no promise of present supremacy; there was no promise of the privilege being handed down to successors. The other apostles had no conception of any superiority being now conferred on Peter. It was not long after this that there was a strife among them who should be the greatest; James and John claimed the highest places in the heavenly kingdom; Paul resisted Peter to the face "because he stood condemned" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>); the president of the first council was James, the Bishop of Jerusalem. It is plain that neither Peter himself nor his fellow apostles understood or acknowledged his supremacy; and that he transmitted, or was intended to transmit, such authority to successors, is a figment unknown to primitive Christianity, and which was gradually erected, to serve ambitious designs, on forged decretals and spurious writings. This is not the place for polemics, and these few apologetic hints are introduced merely with the view of showing that no one need be afraid of the obvious and straightforward interpretation of Christ's words, or suppose that papal claims are necessarily supported thereby. <span class="cmt_word">I will build my Church</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). My Church, not thine. Plainly, therefore, the Church was not yet builded. Christ speaks of it as a house, temple, or palace, perhaps at the moment gazing on some castle founded securely on a rock, safe from flood and storm and hostile attack. We know how commonly he took his illustrations from objects and scenes around him; and the rocky base of the great castle of Caesarea Philippi may well have supplied the material for the metaphor here introduced. The word translated "church" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), is found here for the first time in the New Testament. It is derived from a verb meaning "to call out," and in classical Greek denotes the regular legislative assembly of a people. In the Septuagint it represents the Hebrew <span class="accented">kahal</span>, the congregation united into one society and forming one polity (see Trench, 'Synonyms'). The name <span class="accented">kehila</span> in modern times is applied to every Jewish community which has its own synagogue and ministers. From the use of the metaphor of a house, and the word employed to designate the Church, we see that it was not to be a mere loose collection of items, but an organized whole, united, officered, and permanent. Hence the word <span class="accented">Ecclesia</span> has been that which designated the Christian society, and has been handed down and recognized in all ages and in all countries. It may be regarded as the personal part of that kingdom of heaven which was to embrace the whole world, when "the kingdom of the world is become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>; see Introduction, &sect; 10.). <span class="cmt_word">The gates of hell</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f85;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">shall not prevail against it.</span> Hades, which our version calls "hell," is the region of the dead, a gloomy and desolate place, according to Jewish tradition, situated in the centre of the earth, a citadel with walls and gates, which admitted the souls of men, but opened not for their egress. There are two ways of explaining these words, though they both come to much the same idea. The gates of Hades represent the entrance thereto; and the Lord affirms that death shall have no power over the members of the Church; they shall be able to rise superior to its attacks, even if for a time they seem to succumb; their triumphant cry shall he, "O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-55.htm">1 Corinthians 15:55</a>). Through the grave and gate of death they shall pass to a joyful resurrection. The other interpretation is derived from the fact that in Oriental cities the gate is the scene of deliberation and counsel. Hence "the gates" here may represent the evil designs planned by the powers of hell to overthrow the Church, the wiles and machinations of the devil and his angels, Hades being taken, not as the abode of the dead, but as the realm of Satan. Neither malignant spirits nor their allies, such as sin, persecution, heresy, shall be able to wreck the eternal building which Christ was founding. Combining the two expositions, we may say that Christ herein promises that neither the power of death nor the power of the devil <span class="accented">shall prevail against it</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>), shall overpower it, keep it in subjection. The pronoun refers doubtless to <span class="accented">Church</span>, not <span class="accented">rock</span>, the verb being more applicable to the former than the latter, and the pronoun being nearer in position to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>. To see here an assurance of the infallibility of the pope, as Romanists do, is to force the words of Scripture most unwarrantably in order to support a modern figment which has done infinite harm to the cause of Christ. As Erasmus says, "Proinde miror esse, qui locum hunc detorqueant ad Romanum Pontificem." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:13-20 Peter, for himself and his brethren, said that they were assured of our Lord's being the promised Messiah, the Son of the living God. This showed that they believed Jesus to be more than man. Our Lord declared Peter to be blessed, as the teaching of God made him differ from his unbelieving countrymen. Christ added that he had named him Peter, in allusion to his stability or firmness in professing the truth. The word translated rock, is not the same word as Peter, but is of a similar meaning. Nothing can be more wrong than to suppose that Christ meant the person of Peter was the rock. Without doubt Christ himself is the Rock, the tried foundation of the church; and woe to him that attempts to lay any other! Peter's confession is this rock as to doctrine. If Jesus be not the Christ, those that own him are not of the church, but deceivers and deceived. Our Lord next declared the authority with which Peter would be invested. He spoke in the name of his brethren, and this related to them as well as to him. They had no certain knowledge of the characters of men, and were liable to mistakes and sins in their own conduct; but they were kept from error in stating the way of acceptance and salvation, the rule of obedience, the believer's character and experience, and the final doom of unbelievers and hypocrites. In such matters their decision was right, and it was confirmed in heaven. But all pretensions of any man, either to absolve or retain men's sins, are blasphemous and absurd. None can forgive sins but God only. And this binding and loosing, in the common language of the Jews, signified to forbid and to allow, or to teach what is lawful or unlawful.</body></html>
