Either the suddenness of their Lord's departure had deprived them of their customary forethought, or, it may be, they were beginning to depend wrongly on the wonder-working power, as though it would be used, not as before, to supply the wants of the famished multitude, but as rendering that forethought needless for themselves.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-12.</span> - <span class="accented">Warning against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-14.htm">Mark 8:14-21</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They had forgotten</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, not pluperfect); <span class="accented">came to the other side, and forgot</span>; <span class="accented">obliti sunt</span> (Vulgate); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they perceived that they had forgotten to take sufficient bread for the journey before them. The district which they were about to traverse was but sparsely inhabited, and offered no hope of supplying this want. It is doubted whether the ensuing conversation took place during the voyage or after they had landed. The language of St. Mark inclines one to believe that the deficiency was discovered during the transit, and the remarks now narrated were made then. As it would take some hours to cross, there was ample time to feel and expatiate upon the need; and if Christ had told them of his future movements, they would naturally feel regret for their carelessness and want of forethought. Or it might be that Christ's observation concerning the leaven was made in the beat, and his reproof of their thoughts was given on landing. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:5-12 Christ speaks of spiritual things under a similitude, and the disciples misunderstand him of carnal things. He took it ill that they should think him as thoughtful about bread as they were; that they should be so little acquainted with his way of preaching. Then understood they what he meant. Christ teaches by the Spirit of wisdom in the heart, opening the understanding to the Spirit of revelation in the word.</body></html>
