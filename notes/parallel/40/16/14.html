They were based, it will be seen in each case, upon a popular doctrine of transmigration, to which the Pharisees had given a place in their system of teaching. The great actors of the past were still in existence. They might, at any great national crisis, reappear to continue and complete their work. Each of the answers has a further special interest of its own. (1.) The identification of our Lord with the Baptist has already met us as coming from the lips of the tetrarch Antipas, adopted, but not originated, by him as explaining our Lord's mighty works (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-2.htm" title="And said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.">Matthew 14:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-7.htm" title="Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;">Luke 9:7</a>). (2.) The belief that Elijah had reappeared was of the same nature. He was expected as the forerunner of the Messiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-5.htm" title="Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:">Malachi 4:5</a>). The imagination of the people had at first seen in the Baptist the reappearance of the Tishbite, but he, though working in the spirit and power of Elijah, had disclaimed the character which was thus ascribed to him, and it was natural that the imagination of the people should now turn to One who appeared to them as simply continuing his work. The character of our Lord's recent miracles, corresponding as it did to that which was recorded as wrought by Elijah for the widow of Sarepta (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-14.htm" title="For thus said the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sends rain on the earth.">1Kings 17:14</a>), had probably strengthened that impression. (3.) The name of Jeremiah introduces a new train of legendary thought. The impression made by that prophet on the minds of men had led to something like a mythical after-growth. It was said that the spirit of Jeremiah had passed into Zechariah (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-9.htm" title="Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;">Matthew 27:9</a>), and on that assumption another reappearance might well seem probable. He, it was believed, had hidden the ark, and the tabernacle, and the altar of incense in a cave in "the mountain where Moses climbed up and saw the heritage of God"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in Nebo, or Pisgah (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/2-1.htm" title="It is also found in the records, that Jeremy the prophet commanded them that were carried away to take of the fire, as it hath been signified:">2 Maccabees 2:1-7</a>)--and was expected to come and guide the people in the time "when God should gather His people together" to the place of concealment. He had appeared to Judas Maccabeus in a vision as "a man with grey hairs, and exceeding glorious," and as the guardian prophet of the people, praying for them and for the Holy City, had given him a golden sword as the gift of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/15-13.htm" title="This done, in like manner there appeared a man with gray hairs, and exceeding glorious, who was of a wonderful and excellent majesty.">2 Maccabees 15:13-16</a>). As the prophet who had foretold the new covenant and the coming of the Lord our Righteousness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm" title="In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.">Jeremiah 23:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:">Jeremiah 31:31</a>) he was identified, as thoroughly as Isaiah, with the Messianic expectations of the people. Something, we may add, there may have been in our Lord's human aspect, as a Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, which may have helped to suggest this identification with the prophet who was, above all others of the goodly company, a prophet of lamentations and tears and woe. (4.) The last conjecture was more vague and undefined, and was probably the resource of those who were impressed with wonder at our Lord's words and works, and yet could not bring themselves to acknowledge Him as what He claimed to be. All the four conjectures, it will be seen, fell far short of the recognition of the Christ.<p>Interpreted in connection with the vision of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a>, the words of the question, "Whom do men say that I, <span class= "ital">the Son of Man,</span> am?" did, in fact, assume His claim to be the Christ. But it remained to be seen whether the disciples had risen to their Lord's meaning in thus speaking of Himself, and would, on their part, adopt that interpretation. The report which they made of the belief of others shows how little, at this time (whatever may have been the case earlier or later), He was regarded as the Messiah by the mass of the people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">John the Baptist.</span> This was the opinion of Herod Antipas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-1.htm">Matthew 14:1, 2</a>), who fancied that Christ was animated by the spirit of John the Baptist, or was actually that personage' revived; though it was noticed by others that John did no miracle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-41.htm">John 10:41</a>), and lived a life in contrast to that of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-18.htm">Matthew 11:18, 19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Elias</span>; Elijah, who was taken up to heaven without dying, and was announced by Malachi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5</a>) as destined to return before the appearance of Messiah. <span class="cmt_word">Jeremias</span>. Some opined that he was Jeremiah, who was expected to come as a precursor of Messiah (2 Esdras 2:18), and reveal the tabernacle, ark, and the altar of incense, which, according to the legend of 2 Macc. 2:4-7, he had hidden in Mount Nebo, "until the time that God gather his people again together, and receive them unto mercy." One of the prophets. One of the celebrated prophets of antiquity revived, restored to life again to prepare the way for the great consummation. The well known prediction of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>) may have given rise to this idea. The four popular opinions here mentioned showed two facts - that Jesus had a high reputation among his contemporaries, and that he was by none at this time regarded as the Messiah. Even those who, after certain of his marvellous works, had been ready to honour him with that title, soon cooled in their ardour, and, checked by his reserve and the slanders of the Pharisees, learned to see in him only a wonder-worker or a precursor of the expected Prince and Liberator. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:13-20 Peter, for himself and his brethren, said that they were assured of our Lord's being the promised Messiah, the Son of the living God. This showed that they believed Jesus to be more than man. Our Lord declared Peter to be blessed, as the teaching of God made him differ from his unbelieving countrymen. Christ added that he had named him Peter, in allusion to his stability or firmness in professing the truth. The word translated rock, is not the same word as Peter, but is of a similar meaning. Nothing can be more wrong than to suppose that Christ meant the person of Peter was the rock. Without doubt Christ himself is the Rock, the tried foundation of the church; and woe to him that attempts to lay any other! Peter's confession is this rock as to doctrine. If Jesus be not the Christ, those that own him are not of the church, but deceivers and deceived. Our Lord next declared the authority with which Peter would be invested. He spoke in the name of his brethren, and this related to them as well as to him. They had no certain knowledge of the characters of men, and were liable to mistakes and sins in their own conduct; but they were kept from error in stating the way of acceptance and salvation, the rule of obedience, the believer's character and experience, and the final doom of unbelievers and hypocrites. In such matters their decision was right, and it was confirmed in heaven. But all pretensions of any man, either to absolve or retain men's sins, are blasphemous and absurd. None can forgive sins but God only. And this binding and loosing, in the common language of the Jews, signified to forbid and to allow, or to teach what is lawful or unlawful.</body></html>
