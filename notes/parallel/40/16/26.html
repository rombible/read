It is probably intended as a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-7.htm">Psalm 49:7, 8</a>. Wordsworth notes that it is quoted by Ignatius, 'Ep. ad Romans,' 6; but it is probably an early interpolation there. The whole world. It is but a trifle of the whole world, with its riches, honours, pleasures, which the most successful man can obtain; but granted it all lay at his feet, how would it repay him for the loss of everlasting life? <span class="cmt_word">Lose his own soul</span> (<span class="accented">life</span>) (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>). The phrase means "suffer loss in respect of," equivalent to "forfeit," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-25.htm">Luke 9:25</a>. "Life" here is the higher life, the life in God.

"Again, he dwells upon the same point. 'What? hast thou another soul to give for this soul?' saith he. 'Why, shouldst thou lose money, thou wilt be able to give other money;or be it house, or slaves, or any other kinds of possession; but for thy soul, if thou lose it, thou wilt have no other soul to give: yea, though thou hadst the world, though thou wast king of the whole earth, thou wouldst not be able, by paying down all earthly goods, together wits the earth itself, to redeem even one soul" (Chrys.,' Hom.,' 55). The value of the soul is often expressed in classical adages. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x2e;</span><br /><span class="accented">"Naught is of higher value than the soul."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f51;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;</span><br /><span class="accented">"Naught unto men is dearer than the life."</span> So Homer, 'Iliad,' 9:401- <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"For not the stores which Troy, they say, contained<br />In peaceful times, ere came the sons of Greece,<br />Nor all the treasures which Apollo's shrine,<br />The archer-god, in rock built Pythos holds,<br />May weigh with life...<br />But when the breath of man hath passed his lips,<br />Nor strength nor foray can the loss repair."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Lord Derby.</span>) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:24-28 A true disciple of Christ is one that does follow him in duty, and shall follow him to glory. He is one that walks in the same way Christ walked in, is led by his Spirit, and treads in his steps, whithersoever he goes. Let him deny himself. If self-denial be a hard lesson, it is no more than what our Master learned and practised, to redeem us, and to teach us. Let him take up his cross. The cross is here put for every trouble that befalls us. We are apt to think we could bear another's cross better than our own; but that is best which is appointed us, and we ought to make the best of it. We must not by our rashness and folly pull crosses down upon our own heads, but must take them up when they are in our way. If any man will have the name and credit of a disciple, let him follow Christ in the work and duty of a disciple. If all worldly things are worthless when compared with the life of the body, how forcible the same argument with respect to the soul and its state of never-ending happiness or misery! Thousands lose their souls for the most trifling gain, or the most worthless indulgence, nay, often from mere sloth and negligence. Whatever is the object for which men forsake Christ, that is the price at which Satan buys their souls. Yet one soul is worth more than all the world. This is Christ's judgment upon the matter; he knew the price of souls, for he redeemed them; nor would he underrate the world, for he made it. The dying transgressor cannot purchase one hour's respite to seek mercy for his perishing soul. Let us then learn rightly to value our souls, and Christ as the only Saviour of them.</body></html>
