They are an essentially Hebrew formula (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-1.htm" title="This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;">Genesis 5:1</a>), and were applied chiefly though not exclusively (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-2.htm" title="These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought to his father their evil report.">Genesis 37:2</a>) to genealogies such as that which follows here.<p><span class= "bld">Jesus Christ.</span>--The collocation of names was not so much a thing of course when St. Matthew wrote as it now seems to us. There were many who bore the name of Jesus--<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> Jesus the son or Sirach, Jesus surnamed Justus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-11.htm" title=" And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellow workers to the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort to me.">Colossians 4:11</a>), possibly even Jesus Bar-abbas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-17.htm" title="Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom will you that I release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?">Matthew 27:17</a>). It was necessary to state that the genealogy that followed was that of Jesus the Messiah, the true "anointed" of the Lord.<p><span class= "bld">The son of David.</span>--This, of course, was added as the most popular of all the names of the expected Christ, owned alike by scribes and Rabbis (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-42.htm" title="Saying, What think you of Christ? whose son is he? They say to him, The son of David.">Matthew 22:42</a>), by children (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-9.htm" title="And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.">Matthew 21:9</a>), and by the poor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-22.htm" title="And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried to him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, you son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.">Matthew 15:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-30.htm" title="And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, you son of David.">Matthew 20:30</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The son of Abraham.</span>--There is no reason to think that this was ever a specially Messianic title. If there is any special significance in its occurrence here, it is as emphasising that which the Messiah had in common with other Israelites. He was thus as a brother to them all, even to the despised publican (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-9.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, This day is salvation come to this house, as much as he also is a son of Abraham.">Luke 19:9</a>), as being the seed of Abraham, in whom all the nations of the earth were to be blessed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-18.htm" title="And in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because you have obeyed my voice.">Genesis 22:18</a>). The former thought appears in another book specially written, like this Gospel, for Hebrews--"On the seed of Abraham he layeth hold" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-16.htm" title="For truly he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.">Hebrews 2:16</a>).<p>(1) Nothing can be inferred directly from St. Matthew's phrase "till she had brought forth" as to what followed after the birth. The writer's purpose is obviously to emphasise the absence of all that might interfere with the absolutely supernatural character of the birth itself. (2) Nothing can be inferred with certainty from the mention of our Lord's "brethren" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-46.htm" title="While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood without, desiring to speak with him.">Matthew 12:46</a> (see Note there), and elsewhere. They may have been children of Joseph by a former marriage, or by what was known as a levirate marriage with the widow of a deceased brother, under the law of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-5.htm" title="If brothers dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without to a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in to her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother to her.">Deuteronomy 25:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-24.htm" title="Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.">Matthew 22:24</a>, or children by adoption, or cousins included under the general name of brethren. (3) The fact that the mother of our Lord found a home with the beloved disciple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-27.htm" title="Then said he to the disciple, Behold your mother! And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home.">John 19:27</a>) and not with any of the "brethren" points, as far as it goes, to their not being her own children, but it does not go far enough to warrant any positive assertion. Scripture therefore supplies no <span class= "ital">data</span> for any decision on either side, nor does any tradition that can really be called primitive. The reverence for virginity as compared with marriage in the patristic and mediaeval Church made the "ever-virgin" to be one of the received titles of the mother of the Lord. The reaction of natural feeling against that reverence led men in earlier and later times to assert the opposite. Every commentator is influenced consciously or unconsciously by his leanings in this or that direction. And so the matter must rest.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The book of the generation</span>. As St. Matthew was writing only for Jews, and they, by reason of their Old Testament prophecies, looked for the Messiah to be born of a certain family, he begins his Gospel with a pedigree of Jesus. In this he mentions, by way of introduction, the two points to which his countrymen would have special regard - the descent of Jesus from David, the founder of the royal line, him in whose descendants the Ruler of Israel must necessarily (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13-16</a>) be looked for; and also from Abraham, who was the head of the covenant nation, and to whom the promise had been given that in his seed all the nations of the earth should bless themselves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). After this he proceeds to fill up the intervening steps in the genealogy. The spelling of the names in the Authorized Version accords with the Greek, and so varies from the Old Testament orthography; but for the sake of the English reader it is certainly advisable to do what has been done in the Revised Version, viz. to conform the spelling to that of the Old Testament, and, where the Greek varies much, to put that form in the margin. It is better to write <span class="accented">Rahab</span> than <span class="accented">Raehab</span>, and <span class="accented">Shealtiel</span> than <span class="accented">Salathiel.</span> Those who read the Greek Gospels when these were first written read also the Old Testament in Greek, and so were in no confusion. The first verse of the Gospel is doubtless intended as a preface to what is contained in vers. 2-17. It is, indeed, true that the phrase, "the book of the generation" (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">sepher toledoth</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a>.1), might <span class="accented">in itself</span> point rather to events and works connected with the active life of him whose name it precedes (cf. the use of <span class="accented">toledoth</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-1.htm">Genesis 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-1.htm">Genesis 10:1</a>; even Genesis 2:4, <span class="accented">et al.</span>) , <span class="accented">a</span>nd thus might refer to the whole of ch. 1. (Kubel), or even the whole of the First Gospel (Keil); yet the addition of <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Son of David, the Son of Abraham</span>, by summarizing the genealogy, limits the reference of ver. 1 to this alone. Observe <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the same word (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) recurs in ver. 18; but being without <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, has a slightly different meaning; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the word translated" generation" in ver. 17 is <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span>, and means a single stratum of human life. The evangelist uses the name Jesus Christ here as a proper name, customary in later Christian circles (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-17.htm">John 1:17</a>, and especially the traces of development from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>). "Christ" is not used in its signification of "Messiah," or "Anointed," till ver. 17, where it would be better rendered "the Christ." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-17 Concerning this genealogy of our Saviour, observe the chief intention. It is not a needless genealogy. It is not a vain-glorious one, as those of great men often are. It proves that our Lord Jesus is of the nation and family out of which the Messiah was to arise. The promise of the blessing was made to Abraham and his seed; of the dominion, to David and his seed. It was promised to Abraham that Christ should descend from him, Ge 12:3; 22:18; and to David that he should descend from him, 2Sa 7:12; Ps 89:3, etc.; 132:11; and, therefore, unless Jesus is a son of David, and a son of Abraham, he is not the Messiah. Now this is here proved from well-known records. When the Son of God was pleased to take our nature, he came near to us, in our fallen, wretched condition; but he was perfectly free from sin: and while we read the names in his genealogy, we should not forget how low the Lord of glory stooped to save the human race.</body></html>
