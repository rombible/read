St. Luke calls Joseph "the son of Heli." There are two ways in which these differing statements may be made to accord. The two sons of Matthan were Jacob the elder, and Heli the younger. It may be that Mary was the only child of Jacob, and Joseph the son of Heli. Then by marriage with his cousin, Joseph would become Jacob's son as well as Heli's. Or it may be that Jacob died without children, and Heli, marrying his widow according to the Jewish usage, became by her the father of Joseph, who hence would be called Jacob's son, that the elder brother's line might not die out. The points noticed above in respect of these varying pedigrees seem to be all those on which anything needs to be said with the view of comparing them. Their variety stands as a constant evidence of the independence of the two evangelists. Had either of them been conscious of the existence of the other's work. it is inconceivable that he would have made no effort to adjust the pedigree, for which he would possess means now lost for ever. They both design to give us the descent of Joseph from David, this being what a Sew would most regard. The descent of Mary from David is nowhere definitely mentioned in the Gospels, but that Jesus was sprung from David on the mother's side too we are warranted in concluding from the words of the angel to Mary (Luke 1:82), "his father David" (cf. also Delitzsch, 'Hess. Proph.,' &sect; 17). But though we ought not to spend vain labour in attempting to reconcile these two genealogies of Joseph, we can see, from what we know of Jewish customs, grounds enough for understanding how these variations came to exist. The same Jew, we find, was often known under two names; of this we have several examples in the lists of the twelve apostles. It is possible, therefore, that in these two pedigrees there may have been more points of union than we are able to detect. Then the rule, before alluded to, by which a man took the childless widow of his deceased brother for his wife and raised seed unto his brother, may also have led to much confusion of names, which we have now no means of unravelling. The evangelists drew each his own list from some authentic source, accessible to others beside themselves, and the record of which could be verified when the Gospels were set forth. This should satisfy us that those we have received were held by the Jews soon after Christ's time to be truthful records, and that each established from a Jewish point of view the descent of the putative father of Jesus from King David. <span class="cmt_word">Of whom was born Jesus</span>. This name, which, through <span class="accented">Jeshua</span>, is the Greek form <span class="accented">of Joshua</span> (for which, indeed, it stands in the Authorized Version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-45.htm">Acts 7:45</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8</a>), signifies "Jehovah is help," and was not an uncommon name among the Jews, though given with marked significance at this time (see ver. 21). We find, according to the best texts, that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-29.htm">Luke 3:29</a> this name occurs in the pedigree of Joseph (where the Authorized Version has Jose), and the Revised Version has adopted that reading. (Of the way in which the name was augmented when given to the famous successor of Moses, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-16.htm">Numbers 13:16</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Who is called Christ</span>. The evangelist here alludes merely to the well-known fact that Jesus was called by this name. The significance of the word, which is a translation of the Hebrew <span class="accented">Messiah</span>, is "anointed," and in the Old Testament it is given to priests (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3, 5, 16</a>), to a king appointed by Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-21.htm">2 Samuel 19:21</a>), also to King Cyrus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>), and to some unnamed representative of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10</a>). It was subsequently applied to Jesus both in the Greek form and in the Hebrew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-41.htm">John 1:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>). It must, however, be noticed ( <span class="accented">vide</span> Bishop Westcott, Add. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-1.htm">1 John 5:1</a>) that it was not a characteristic title of the promised Saviour in the Old Testament, and was not even specifically applied to him, unless, perhaps, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25, 26</a> - a passage of which the interpretation is very doubtful. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-17 Concerning this genealogy of our Saviour, observe the chief intention. It is not a needless genealogy. It is not a vain-glorious one, as those of great men often are. It proves that our Lord Jesus is of the nation and family out of which the Messiah was to arise. The promise of the blessing was made to Abraham and his seed; of the dominion, to David and his seed. It was promised to Abraham that Christ should descend from him, Ge 12:3; 22:18; and to David that he should descend from him, 2Sa 7:12; Ps 89:3, etc.; 132:11; and, therefore, unless Jesus is a son of David, and a son of Abraham, he is not the Messiah. Now this is here proved from well-known records. When the Son of God was pleased to take our nature, he came near to us, in our fallen, wretched condition; but he was perfectly free from sin: and while we read the names in his genealogy, we should not forget how low the Lord of glory stooped to save the human race.</body></html>
