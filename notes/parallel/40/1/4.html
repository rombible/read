A Jewish legend made him the first to enter the waters of the Red Sea.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Naasson</span> ( <span class="accented">Nahshon</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">begat Salmon</span>. This line of descent, from Nahshon to David, is also given by St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-31.htm">Luke 3:31, 32</a>), and is derived from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18-22</a>. But it has occasioned some difficulty, because it makes but five steps from Nahshon, who (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-7.htm">Numbers 1:7</a>) was one of the heads of fathers' houses at the time of the Exodus, to the days of David. According to the chronology added in the margin of the Authorized Version, this period extended from <span class="date">B.C. 1490</span> to <span class="date">B.C. 1056</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> more than four hundred and thirty years, thus making a generation to consist in each case of more than eighty years. And even according to the more accurate computation of the date of the Exodus ( <span class="date">B.C. 1304</span>) the period would be two hundred and forty-eight years, thus making each generation nearly fifty years. Even this seems very long, especially in the East; so that it is probable that the genealogy in Ruth, merely adopted by the evangelists, recorded only the more important names. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-17 Concerning this genealogy of our Saviour, observe the chief intention. It is not a needless genealogy. It is not a vain-glorious one, as those of great men often are. It proves that our Lord Jesus is of the nation and family out of which the Messiah was to arise. The promise of the blessing was made to Abraham and his seed; of the dominion, to David and his seed. It was promised to Abraham that Christ should descend from him, Ge 12:3; 22:18; and to David that he should descend from him, 2Sa 7:12; Ps 89:3, etc.; 132:11; and, therefore, unless Jesus is a son of David, and a son of Abraham, he is not the Messiah. Now this is here proved from well-known records. When the Son of God was pleased to take our nature, he came near to us, in our fallen, wretched condition; but he was perfectly free from sin: and while we read the names in his genealogy, we should not forget how low the Lord of glory stooped to save the human race.</body></html>
