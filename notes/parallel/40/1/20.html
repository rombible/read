The tense lays stress, not on the continuance of his meditation (contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-19.htm">Acts 10:19</a>), but on the fact that the determination to which he had already come (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>) was already in his mind at the time when the following event happened.

Joseph received his communications by dream (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13, 19, 22</a>); to Mary, doubtless the more holy person, the vision was vouchsafed to her bodily eyes. If Joseph, as seems probable, was old, we here have a beginning of the fulfilment of the promise concerning Messianic times, "Your old men shall dream dreams" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Joseph, thou son of David</span>. In reminding Joseph of the greatness of his ancestry, the angel probably desired <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to accept Joseph's resolution as right in so far as Joseph knew the circumstances, because with the promise of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a> there was special need to keep the line pure; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> but, under the true circumstances, to urge him to take Mary, that so the promise might be fully carried out in his family and no other. <span class="cmt_word">Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife</span> (ver. 15, note).

The mystery of Christ's becoming man is to be adored, not curiously inquired into. It was so ordered that Christ should partake of our nature, yet that he should be pure from the defilement of original sin, which has been communicated to all the race of Adam. Observe, it is the thoughtful, not the unthinking, whom God will guide. God's time to come with instruction to his people, is when they are at a loss. Divine comforts most delight the soul when under the pressure of perplexed thoughts. Joseph is told that Mary should bring forth the Saviour of the world. He was to call his name Jesus, a Saviour. Jesus is the same name with Joshua. And the reason of that name is clear, for those whom Christ saves, he saves from their sins; from the guilt of sin by the merit of his death, and from the power of sin by the Spirit of his grace. In saving them from sin, he saves them from wrath and the curse, and all misery, here and hereafter. Christ came to save his people, not in their sins, but from their sins; and so to redeem them from among men, to himself, who is separate from sinners. Joseph did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, speedily, without delay, and cheerfully, without dispute. By applying the general rules of the written word, we should in all the steps of our lives, particularly the great turns of them, take direction from God, and we shall find this safe and comfortable.</body></html>
