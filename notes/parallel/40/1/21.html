The customs of the Jews were, as we have seen, against any communications between the bride and bridegroom during the period of betrothal, and the facts of the case (including Mary's visit to Elizabeth) would make it more improbable than ever.<p>The name Jesus was one full of meaning, but it was not as yet a specially sacred name. In its Old Testament form of Jehoshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-16.htm" title="These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.">Numbers 13:16</a>), Joshua, or Jeshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-6.htm" title="And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:">Numbers 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-17.htm" title="And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun to that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.">Nehemiah 8:17</a>), it meant "Jehovah is salvation;" and the change of the name of the captain of Israel from Hoshea, which did not include the divine name, to the form which gave this full significance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-16.htm" title="These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.">Numbers 13:16</a>) had made it the expression of the deepest faith of the people. After the return from Babylon it received a new prominence in connection with the high priest Joshua, the son of Josedech (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-1.htm" title="In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,">Haggai 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-1.htm" title="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.">Zechariah 3:1</a>), and appears in its Greek form in Jesus the father, and again in the son, of Sirach. In the New Testament itself we find it borne by others (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-1.htm" title="The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.">Matthew 1:1</a>). It had not been directly associated, however, with Messianic hopes, and the intimation that it was to be the name of the Christ gave a new character to men's thoughts of the kingdom. Not conquest, but "salvation"--deliverance, not from human enemies only or chiefly, nor from the penalties of sin, but from the sins themselves. As spoken by the angel to the dreamer it was the answer to prayers and hopes, going beyond the hope, and purifying it from earthly thoughts. As recorded by the Evangelist it was a witness that he had been taught the true nature of the kingdom of the Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - The first half is almost verbally identical with the promise to Mary in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-31.htm">Luke 1:31</a>. It is, perhaps, hypercritical to see anything more than a coincidence when such common terms are used, but it was not unnatural that the communications of the angels to both Mary and Joseph should be purposely clothed in language similar to that used of Sarah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>), and in measure to that used of Hannah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-20.htm">1 Samuel 1:20</a>; cf.

Ecclus. 46:1, "Jesus the son of Nave... who, according to his name, was made great for the saving of the elect of God"). <span class="cmt_word">For he shall save</span>; for <span class="accented">it is he that shall save</span> (Revised Version), equivalent to "He, and no other, is the expected Saviour." (For <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> in this sense of excluding others, cf. especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-20</a>.) It may, however, here not be exclusive, but only intensive - he being what he is. The connexion will then be - the name <span class="accented">Jesus</span> will answer to the fact, for he himself, in his own Person (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2</a>), by virtue of what he is (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24, 25</a>), shall save, etc. <span class="accented">Jesus</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">Jeshua</span> (ver. 16, note); <span class="accented">he shall save</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">Joshi</span> <span class="accented">a. <span class="cmt_word"></span>His people</span>.

Comparative salvation from sin, due to acceptance of Christ, must precede that restoration which Joseph then desired, and all true Jews still ardently pray for; full salvation from sin will be the final issue of that restoration. From their sins. With a greater salvation, therefore, than that which Manoah's wife was told that her son should begin to accomplish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>). Observe that this promise of Christ as Saviour is given to Joseph, who had deeper experience of sin (ver. 20, note), while to Mary, who is marked by promptness of personal devotion, is given the promise of Christ as King (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32, 33</a>). <span class="accented">Sate</span>... <span class="accented">from</span>( <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span>) , not merely "out of" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-27.htm">John 12:27</a>), but from all attacks of sin considered as coming born without (but see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>, note). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:18-25 Let us look to the circumstances under which the Son of God entered into this lower world, till we learn to despise the vain honours of this world, when compared with piety and holiness. The mystery of Christ's becoming man is to be adored, not curiously inquired into. It was so ordered that Christ should partake of our nature, yet that he should be pure from the defilement of original sin, which has been communicated to all the race of Adam. Observe, it is the thoughtful, not the unthinking, whom God will guide. God's time to come with instruction to his people, is when they are at a loss. Divine comforts most delight the soul when under the pressure of perplexed thoughts. Joseph is told that Mary should bring forth the Saviour of the world. He was to call his name Jesus, a Saviour. Jesus is the same name with Joshua. And the reason of that name is clear, for those whom Christ saves, he saves from their sins; from the guilt of sin by the merit of his death, and from the power of sin by the Spirit of his grace. In saving them from sin, he saves them from wrath and the curse, and all misery, here and hereafter. Christ came to save his people, not in their sins, but from their sins; and so to redeem them from among men, to himself, who is separate from sinners. Joseph did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, speedily, without delay, and cheerfully, without dispute. By applying the general rules of the written word, we should in all the steps of our lives, particularly the great turns of them, take direction from God, and we shall find this safe and comfortable.</body></html>
