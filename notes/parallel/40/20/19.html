The Master looked beyond the suffering to the victory over death, but the disciples could not enter into the meaning of the words that spoke of it. St. Luke, indeed (as if he had gathered from some of those who heard them what had been their state of feeling at the time), reports that "they understood none of these things, and this saying was hid from them, neither understood they the things that were spoken" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-34.htm" title="And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.">Luke 18:34</a>). All was to them as a dark and dim dream, a cloud upon their Master's soul which time, they imagined, would disperse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Gentiles.</span> Pilate and the Romans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-2.htm">Matthew 27:2</a>).

The fact of his death he had impressed upon his apostles, but the mode had. not been mentioned; such an unexpected, awful, and ignomiuious close was incredible. and needed special preparation ere it could be received as true. Intimations, indeed, of such a death had been given darkly, when his disciples were told that they must take up the cross and follow him, or when he spoke of being "lifted up" like the serpent in the wilderness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14</a>); but his words were not understood; they fell upon ears prejudiced to a certain erroneous conviction, which events alone could eradicate. <span class="cmt_word">He shall rise again</span> (see on Matthew 16:21). It seems to us almost incredible that, after all that Christ said here and elsewhere, his resurrection should have come upon his followers as a surprise which they could not believe without tangible proof. But when we read of their dulness and unbelief; we are constrained to admire the candour and sincerity of narrators, who record such facts to their discredit without evasion or apology. As St. Luke says, "They understood none of these things; and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:17-19 Christ is more particular here in foretelling his sufferings than before. And here, as before, he adds the mention of his resurrection and his glory, to that of his death and sufferings, to encourage his disciples, and comfort them. A believing view of our once crucified and now glorified Redeemer, is good to humble a proud, self-justifying disposition. When we consider the need of the humiliation and sufferings of the Son of God, in order to the salvation of perishing sinners, surely we must be aware of the freeness and richness of Divine grace in our salvation.</body></html>
