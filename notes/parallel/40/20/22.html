That nearness to Him in His glory could be obtained only by an equal nearness in suffering. Had they counted the cost of that nearness?<p><span class= "bld">To drink of the cup that I shall drink of.</span>--The words that follow, "to be baptised with the baptism that I am baptised with," are not found in many of the best MSS., and have probably been added to bring St. Matthew's narrative into harmony with St. Mark's. For the sake of completeness, however, they will be examined here. And (1) we have the question, How did the two disciples understand our Lord's words? We are familiar with their meaning. Was it equally clear to them? As far as the cup is concerned, there can be little doubt that any reader of the Old Testament would at once recognise it as the symbol of a good or evil fortune. There was the "cup running over" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-5.htm" title="You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies: you anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over.">Psalm 23:5</a>, the "wine-cup of fury" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-15.htm" title="For thus said the LORD God of Israel to me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it.">Jeremiah 25:15</a>, the "cup of astonishment and desolation" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-33.htm" title="You shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of your sister Samaria.">Ezekiel 23:33</a>. The meaning of the "baptism" was, perhaps, less obvious (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-29.htm" title="And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.">Matthew 20:29</a>, on our Lord's use of the symbolism), yet here also there were the overwhelming "proud waters" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/124-5.htm" title="Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.">Psalm 124:5</a>, the "waves and billows" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-7.htm" title="Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterspouts: all your waves and your billows are gone over me.">Psalm 42:7</a>. The very verb, "to baptize" (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to plunge into the deep), was used by Josephus for the destruction of a city (<span class= "ital">Wars,</span> iv. 3, ? 3), by the LXX. for "terrifying" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-4.htm" title="My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure has he turned into fear to me.">Isaiah 21:4</a>. Our Lord Himself had already used it in dim mysterious reference to His coming passion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-50.htm" title="But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!">Luke 12:50</a>, where see Note). There was enough, then, to lead them to see in their Master's words an intimation of some great suffering about to fall on Him, and this is, indeed, implied in the very form of their answer. "We are able," they say, in the tone of those who have been challenged and accept the challenge. That their insight into the great mystery of the passion went but a little way as compared with their Master's, lies, of course, in the very nature of the case. When the beloved disciple, in after years, taught by his own experience and by his brother's death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-2.htm" title="And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.">Acts 12:2</a>), thought over the words, "Let this cup pass from Me" (26:39), he must have seen somewhat more clearly into its depth of meaning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye know not what ye ask.</span> Jesus addresses, not the mother, but the two brothers who had prompted and virtually made the request. They indeed merited a rebuke for their preposterous demand; but the Saviour deals mildly with them. They had spoken ignorantly, perhaps fancying that some favour might be shown to them on the ground of their relationship to the Virgin Mary, or because of their nearness to Jesus, and certainly not in the least realizing the nature of the kingdom, the qualifications of its inheritors, or the difficulties that have to be surmounted by those who would win eminent positions therein. Things that we deem most desirable would often be the very worst for our spiritual progress; and in praying for really good things, we are apt to forget to count the cost we must pay for their attainment. Jesus sets before the ambitious brethren the obstacles that would meet them. <span class="cmt_word">Are ye able to drink of the cup?</span> Joy and sorrow, blessing and affliction, in Holy Scripture are often denoted under the metaphor of a cup (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>). Here the cup signifies the internal, mental, and spiritual sufferings which Christ endured (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39, 42</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That I shall drink of;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">which I am about to drink</span>; or am purposing to drink. Christ expresses his voluntary intention of suffering bitterly, and asks if they are prepared to do the same. <span class="cmt_word">To he baptized,</span> etc. The baptism is significant of the external pains and persecutions, in the sea of which he was to be sunk (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-2.htm">Psalm 69:2, 15</a>). The cup and the baptism adumbrate the two sacraments by which we are made one with Christ. Many of the best manuscripts, the Vulgate and other versions, omit this last clause, and the corresponding one in the following verse; and many modern editors, with the Revised Version, expunge it also. It is supposed to have been introduced from the parallel passage in St. Mark. There it is undoubtedly genuine; so we have good warrant to believe that our Lord spoke the words, whether St. Matthew really reported them or not. <span class="cmt_word">We are able.</span> They came forward now and answered in simplicity, not understanding that to which they pledged themselves. They loved their Master, they knew that trials awaited him, and they were willing to share his lot. Ere long they were put to the proof, and in the end came out victorious. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:20-28 The sons of Zebedee abused what Christ said to comfort the disciples. Some cannot have comforts but they turn them to a wrong purpose. Pride is a sin that most easily besets us; it is sinful ambition to outdo others in pomp and grandeur. To put down the vanity and ambition of their request, Christ leads them to the thoughts of their sufferings. It is a bitter cup that is to be drunk of; a cup of trembling, but not the cup of the wicked. It is but a cup, it is but a draught, bitter perhaps, but soon emptied; it is a cup in the hand of a Father, Joh 18:11. Baptism is an ordinance by which we are joined to the Lord in covenant and communion; and so is suffering for Christ, Eze 20:37; Isa 48:10. Baptism is an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace; and so is suffering for Christ, for unto us it is given, Php 1:29. But they knew not what Christ's cup was, nor what his baptism. Those are commonly most confident, who are least acquainted with the cross. Nothing makes more mischief among brethren, than desire of greatness. And we never find Christ's disciples quarrelling, but something of this was at the bottom of it. That man who labours most diligently, and suffers most patiently, seeking to do good to his brethren, and to promote the salvation of souls, most resembles Christ, and will be most honoured by him to all eternity. Our Lord speaks of his death in the terms applied to the sacrifices of old. It is a sacrifice for the sins of men, and is that true and substantial sacrifice, which those of the law faintly and imperfectly represented. It was a ransom for many, enough for all, working upon many; and, if for many, then the poor trembling soul may say, Why not for me?</body></html>
