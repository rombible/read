John was known emphatically as "the disciple whom Jesus loved" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-23.htm" title="Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.">John 13:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-26.htm" title="When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he said to his mother, Woman, behold your son!">John 19:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-2.htm" title="Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.">John 20:2</a>), and if we may infer a general practice from that of the Last Supper (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-23.htm" title="Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.">John 13:23</a>), he sat near Him at their customary meals. James was one of the chosen three who had been witnesses of the Transfiguration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-1.htm" title="And after six days Jesus takes Peter, James, and John his brother, and brings them up into an high mountain apart,">Matthew 17:1</a>). Both had been marked out for special honour by the new name of the Sons of Thunder (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-17.htm" title="And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:">Mark 3:17</a>). The mother might well think that she was but asking for her sons a continuance of what they had hitherto enjoyed. The sternness of our Lord's words to Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-23.htm" title="But he turned, and said to Peter, Get you behind me, Satan: you are an offense to me: for you mind not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.">Matthew 16:23</a>) might almost justify the thought that his position had been forfeited.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What wilt thou.</span> Jesus will make no unconditional promise; he compels her to formulate her petition. <span class="cmt_word">Grant</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;</span>: <span class="accented">command</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>These my two sons.</span> She points to them, as they stood or knelt behind her. <span class="cmt_word">May sit... in thy kingdom.</span> The right and left hand would be the places occupied by those next to the sovereign in dignity and consideration. There is here no thought of St. Peter's pre-eminence (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-19.htm">1 Kings 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-18.htm">2 Chronicles 18:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>). The petition was urged at this moment, because it was felt that a great crisis was at hand. This visit to Jerusalem must have momentous results; here Jesus was about to set up his throne; now was the moment to secure the highest places in his court. He had announced his death; he had also announced his glory; they balanced one declaration against the other, and seized on that which was most consonant to their national prejudices and their own ambitious views. Probably they interpreted the unintelligible resurrection to mean the establishment of the kingdom of Messiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-11.htm">Luke 19:11</a>). If this was imminent, no time was to be lost in making their claims known. So thought the "sons of thunder," and acted with energy and haste. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:20-28 The sons of Zebedee abused what Christ said to comfort the disciples. Some cannot have comforts but they turn them to a wrong purpose. Pride is a sin that most easily besets us; it is sinful ambition to outdo others in pomp and grandeur. To put down the vanity and ambition of their request, Christ leads them to the thoughts of their sufferings. It is a bitter cup that is to be drunk of; a cup of trembling, but not the cup of the wicked. It is but a cup, it is but a draught, bitter perhaps, but soon emptied; it is a cup in the hand of a Father, Joh 18:11. Baptism is an ordinance by which we are joined to the Lord in covenant and communion; and so is suffering for Christ, Eze 20:37; Isa 48:10. Baptism is an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace; and so is suffering for Christ, for unto us it is given, Php 1:29. But they knew not what Christ's cup was, nor what his baptism. Those are commonly most confident, who are least acquainted with the cross. Nothing makes more mischief among brethren, than desire of greatness. And we never find Christ's disciples quarrelling, but something of this was at the bottom of it. That man who labours most diligently, and suffers most patiently, seeking to do good to his brethren, and to promote the salvation of souls, most resembles Christ, and will be most honoured by him to all eternity. Our Lord speaks of his death in the terms applied to the sacrifices of old. It is a sacrifice for the sins of men, and is that true and substantial sacrifice, which those of the law faintly and imperfectly represented. It was a ransom for many, enough for all, working upon many; and, if for many, then the poor trembling soul may say, Why not for me?</body></html>
