It is not too much to say that we can scarcely understand it at all unless we connect it with the history of the young ruler who had great possessions, and the claims which the disciples had made for themselves when they contrasted their readiness with his reluctance.<p><span class= "bld">To hire labourers into his vineyard.</span>--The framework of the parable brings before us a form of labour in some respects lower than that of the "servants," or "slaves," who formed part of the household, and had been bought or born to their position. The labourers here are the "hired servants" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-17.htm" title="And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!">Luke 15:17</a>, engaged for a time only, and paid by the day. Interpreting the parable, we may see in the householder our Lord Himself. It was indeed a title which He seems to have, as it were, delighted in, and which He applies directly to Himself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-25.htm" title="It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?">Matthew 10:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-27.htm" title="So the servants of the householder came and said to him, Sir, did not you sow good seed in your field? from where then has it tares?">Matthew 13:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-52.htm" title="Then said he to them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed to the kingdom of heaven is like to a man that is an householder, which brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.">Matthew 13:52</a>. And the "vineyard" is primarily, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-1.htm" title="Now will I sing to my well beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My well beloved has a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:">Isaiah 5:1</a>, the house of Israel, which the Anointed of the Lord had come to claim as His kingdom. The "early morning" answered accordingly to the beginning of our Lord's ministry; the "labourers" He then called were the disciples whom, at the outset of His ministry, He had summoned to follow Him. He had promised them a reward. Though at the best they were unprofitable servants, He yet offered them wages, and the wages were the kingdom of heaven itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-3.htm" title="Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-10.htm" title="Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:10</a>); in other words, "righteousness, and peace, and joy;" in other words, yet again, "eternal life, seeing and knowing God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-8.htm" title="Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.">Matthew 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>). We may trace, I believe, something of a subtle and peculiar fitness in our Lord's choice of this form of labour, as distinct, on the one side, from free and willing service, and, on the other, from the task-work of slaves. It was not in itself the best or most adequate symbol of the relation of the disciples to their Lord, but as their question, "What shall we have, therefore?" implies, it was that on which their minds were dwelling, and therefore He chose it, adapting Himself so far to their weakness, that He might teach them the lesson which they needed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-16.</span> - <span class="accented">Parable of the labourers in the vineyard</span>. (Peculiar to St. Matthew.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>. The following parable is intended to illustrate the apophthegm at the end of the last chapter, which is repeated almost in the same words at the close, "Many that are first," etc., and "The last shall be first," etc. It taught the apostles a lesson in answer to Peter's question (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-27.htm">Matthew 19:27</a>), "What shall we have therefore?" and the primary lesson was that the reward of the kingdom is not of debt, but of grace. There are many difficulties in the parable, which may be better noticed after we have expounded its literal bearing and details. <span class="cmt_word">The kingdom of heaven is like.</span> That is, what happens in the kingdom of heaven is parallel to the case of a householder, etc. The kingdom of heaven is the Church of Christ, whether militant on earth (when the labourers are hired) or triumphant in heaven (when the reward is bestowed). We may refer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24, 45</a>, where an analogous comparison is found. <span class="cmt_word">Early in the morning</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x1f77;</span>); <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. at the end of the last night watch (see on ver. 3), wishing to secure labourers, who at vintage time were probably in great request. <span class="cmt_word">Vineyard</span>. The Church is elsewhere so called by our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-28.htm">Matthew 21:28, 33</a>, etc.), and in the Old Testament (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-10.htm">Jeremiah 12:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-16 The direct object of this parable seems to be, to show that though the Jews were first called into the vineyard, at length the gospel should be preached to the Gentiles, and they should be admitted to equal privileges and advantages with the Jews. The parable may also be applied more generally, and shows, 1. That God is debtor to no man. 2. That many who begin last, and promise little in religion, sometimes, by the blessing of God, arrive at a great deal of knowledge, grace, and usefulness. 3. That the recompense of reward will be given to the saints, but not according to the time of their conversion. It describes the state of the visible church, and explains the declaration that the last shall be first, and the first last, in its various references. Till we are hired into the service of God, we are standing all the day idle: a sinful state, though a state of drudgery to Satan, may be called a state of idleness. The market-place is the world, and from that we are called by the gospel. Come, come from this market-place. Work for God will not admit of trifling. A man may go idle to hell, but he that will go to heaven, must be diligent. The Roman penny was sevenpence halfpenny in our money, wages then enough for the day's support. This does not prove that the reward of our obedience to God is of works, or of debt; when we have done all, we are unprofitable servants; but it signifies that there is a reward set before us, yet let none, upon this presumption, put off repentance till they are old. Some were sent into the vineyard at the eleventh hour; but nobody had hired them before. The Gentiles came in at the eleventh hour; the gospel had not been before preached to them. Those that have had gospel offers made them at the third or sixth hour, and have refused them, will not have to say at the eleventh hour, as these had, No man has hired us. Therefore, not to discourage any, but to awaken all, be it remembered, that now is the accepted time. The riches of Divine grace are loudly murmured at, among proud Pharisees and nominal Christians. There is great proneness in us to think that we have too little, and others too much of the tokens of God's favour; and that we do too much, and others too little in the work of God. But if God gives grace to others, it is kindness to them, and no injustice to us. Carnal worldlings agree with God for their penny in this world; and choose their portion in this life. Obedient believers agree with God for their penny in the other world, and must remember they have so agreed. Didst not thou agree to take up with heaven as thy portion, thy all; wilt thou seek for happiness in the creature? God punishes none more than they deserve, and recompenses every service done for him; he therefore does no wrong to any, by showing extraordinary grace to some. See here the nature of envy. It is an evil eye, which is displeased at the good of others, and desires their hurt. It is a grief to ourselves, displeasing to God, and hurtful to our neighbours: it is a sin that has neither pleasure, profit, nor honour. Let us forego every proud claim, and seek for salvation as a free gift. Let us never envy or grudge, but rejoice and praise God for his mercy to others as well as to ourselves.</body></html>
