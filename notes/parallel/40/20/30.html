(1.) The former agrees with St. Matthew as to time and place, but speaks of <span class= "ital">one</span> blind man only, and gives his name as "Bartimseus, the son of Timaeus." (2.) The latter speaks of one only, and fixes the time of the miracle at our Lord's entry into Jericho. The probable explanation of (1) is, that of the two men, the one whom St. Mark names was the more conspicuous and better known, and of (2), that St. Luke, visiting the scene and having the spot pointed out to him outside the gates of the city, was left to conjecture, or was misinformed, as to the work having been done when our Lord drew nigh unto it. The fact that St. Luke alone records the incident connected with Zacchaeus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/19-1.htm" title="And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.">Luke 19:1-10</a>) indicates either that he had been on the spot as an inquirer, or had sought for local sources of information. The assumption that he recorded a different miracle from St. Matthew and St. Mark is possible, but hardly probable, and certainly needless, except on a very rigid and <span class= "ital">a priori</span> theory of inspiration. It is possible, again, that St. Luke's local inquiries may have made his narrative more accurate than the recollection on which St. Matthew's and St. Mark's rested.<p><span class= "bld">O Lord, thou son of David.</span>--The blind men probably echoed the whispered murmurs of the crowd that was sweeping by, or, in any case, used (as did the woman of Canaan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-22.htm" title="And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried to him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, you son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.">Matthew 15:22</a>) the most popular and widely diffused of the names of the Messiah. They were beggars, and they appealed to the pity of the King.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Two blind men.</span> St. Matthew is doubtless accurate in this statement. Tradition might easily drop one of the sufferers in the course of time, but it is not likely to have multiplied one into two. These sufferers had heard of the miracles of healing performed by Jesus in his various circuits, and especially of the late cure at Jerusalem of one born blind, and they were ready to believe in his power and to profit by his mercy. <span class="cmt_word">Heard</span>. The beggars (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-46.htm">Mark 10:46</a>), debarred from sight, had their attention aroused by the tread of numerous feet, and the voices of the excited crowd, and naturally asked the bystanders to tell them what it all meant. When they heard that Jesus was there, the hope of relief immediately rushed into their mind. <span class="cmt_word">Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David!</span> "O Lord" is only the usual respectful address of an inferior to one in higher station; but to call on Jesus as "Son of David" was virtually to acknowledge him to be the Messiah, who, as old prophets foretold, was to open the eyes of the blind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-18.htm">Isaiah 29:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>). The same cry had been raised by the blind men who were cured earlier in the ministry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-27.htm">Matthew 9:27</a>), and by the Syro-Phoenician woman (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-22.htm">Matthew 15:22</a>, where see note), How these men had learned the truth we know not; they could not see or read for themselves; their faith must have come by hearing, and the inward illumination of the Holy Spirit. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:29-34 It is good for those under the same trial, or infirmity of body or mind, to join in prayer to God for relief, that they may quicken and encourage one another. There is mercy enough in Christ for all that ask. They were earnest in prayer. They cried out as men in earnest. Cold desires beg denials. They were humble in prayer, casting themselves upon, and referring themselves cheerfully to, the Mediator's mercy. They showed faith in prayer, by the title they gave to Christ. Surely it was by the Holy Ghost that they called Jesus, Lord. They persevered in prayer. When they were in pursuit of such mercy, it was no time for timidity or hesitation: they cried earnestly. Christ encouraged them. The wants and burdens of the body we are soon sensible of, and can readily relate. Oh that we did as feelingly complain of our spiritual maladies, especially our spiritual blindness! Many are spiritually blind, yet say they see. Jesus cured these blind men; and when they had received sight, they followed him. None follow Christ blindly. He first by his grace opens men's eyes, and so draws their hearts after him. These miracles are our call to Jesus; may we hear it, and make it our daily prayer to grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</body></html>
