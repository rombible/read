To minister to the maintenance of a scribe was, they taught, the best use of wealth. The "long prayer" refers probably to the well-known Eighteen Prayers, which formed the standard of the Pharisee's devotion.

There is some doubt about the genuineness of this verse, and our Revisers have expunged it from their text, relegating it to the margin. It is omitted by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, D, L, Z, some copies of the Vulgate and some versions; on the other hand, it is found in E, F, G, H, K, M, and other later uncials, and in the received Vulgate and Syriac Versions. Critics reject it as a supposed interpolation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-40.htm">Mark 12:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-47.htm">Luke 20:47</a>. At any rate, whether spoken now or at another time, it is undoubtedly an utterance of Christ, and to be received with all reverence. <span class="cmt_word">Ye devour widows' houses.</span> Women who have lost their natural protector become their prey. To these they attach themselves, winning them over by flattery and fraud, and persuading them to assist them with their substance to the ruin of their fortunes. God had always defended the cause of widows, and had urged his people to deal gently and mercifully with them (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-19.htm">Deuteronomy 27:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-3.htm">Luke 18:3-7</a>). This woe is followed in St. Luke by the episode of the widow's mite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-47.htm">Luke 20:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-1.htm">Luke 21:1-4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And for a pretence make long prayer;</span> or, <span class="accented">and that, making long prayers for a pretence.</span> They put on an appearance of extraordinary devotion, that they might more easily secure the favour of the widows; or else they exacted large sums of money, engaging to offer continual prayers for the donors (compare St. Paul's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-6.htm">2 Timothy 3:6</a>). Thus these hypocrites made a gain of godliness at the expense of the most helpless members of the community. <span class="cmt_word">Greater</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">more abundant</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>damnation.</span> No condemnation in this world or the next can be more justly awarded than to him who adds hypocrisy to covetousness, and makes religion a cloke for cruel rapacity. The comparative may refer to "the lengthened hypocritical prayers which went before" (Lange). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:13-33 The scribes and Pharisees were enemies to the gospel of Christ, and therefore to the salvation of the souls of men. It is bad to keep away from Christ ourselves, but worse also to keep others from him. Yet it is no new thing for the show and form of godliness to be made a cloak to the greatest enormities. But dissembled piety will be reckoned double iniquity. They were very busy to turn souls to be of their party. Not for the glory of God and the good of souls, but that they might have the credit and advantage of making converts. Gain being their godliness, by a thousand devices they made religion give way to their worldly interests. They were very strict and precise in smaller matters of the law, but careless and loose in weightier matters. It is not the scrupling a little sin that Christ here reproves; if it be a sin, though but a gnat, it must be strained out; but the doing that, and then swallowing a camel, or, committing a greater sin. While they would seem to be godly, they were neither sober nor righteous. We are really, what we are inwardly. Outward motives may keep the outside clean, while the inside is filthy; but if the heart and spirit be made new, there will be newness of life; here we must begin with ourselves. The righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees was like the ornaments of a grave, or dressing up a dead body, only for show. The deceitfulness of sinners' hearts appears in that they go down the streams of the sins of their own day, while they fancy that they should have opposed the sins of former days. We sometimes think, if we had lived when Christ was upon earth, that we should not have despised and rejected him, as men then did; yet Christ in his Spirit, in his word, in his ministers, is still no better treated. And it is just with God to give those up to their hearts' lusts, who obstinately persist in gratifying them. Christ gives men their true characters.</body></html>
