The things so named were worn by well-nigh all Jews as soon as they became Children of the Law, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> at thirteen. They consisted of a small box containing the four passages in which frontlets are mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/13-2.htm" title="Sanctify to me all the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.">Exodus 13:2-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/6-4.htm" title="Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/11-13.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,">Deuteronomy 11:13-22</a>), written on four slips of vellum for the phylactery of the head, and on one for that of the arm. This is fastened by a loop to thin leather straps, which are twisted in the one case round the arm, with the box on the heart, in the other, round the head, with the box on the brow. They were worn commonly during the act of prayer (hence the Hebrew name), and by those who made a show of perpetual devotion and study of the Law, during the whole day. The Pharisees, in their ostentatious show of piety, made either the box or the straps wider than the common size, and wore them as they walked to and fro in the streets, or prayed standing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-5.htm" title="And when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:5</a>), that men might see and admire them.<p><span class= "bld">The borders of their garments.</span>--The word is the same as the "hem" of the garment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-20.htm" title="And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:">Matthew 9:20</a>) worn by our Lord. The practice rested on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/15-37.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Numbers 15:37-41</a>, which enjoined a "ribband" or "thread" of blue (the colour symbolical of heaven) to be put into the fringe or tassels of the outer cloak or plaid. The other threads were white, and the number of threads 613, as coinciding with the number of precepts in the Law, as counted by the scribes. The fringes in question were worn, as we see, by our Lord (see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-20.htm" title="And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:">Matthew 9:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-36.htm" title="And sought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.">Matthew 14:36</a>), and probably by the disciples. It was reserved for the Pharisees to make them so conspicuous as to attract men's notice.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For to be seen of men.</span> The second bad principle in their religion was ostentation and vanity. Acts done professedly in the honour of God were animated by self-seeking and ambition. They never penetrated beyond externalism. See this spirit reproved in the sermon on the mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1, 2</a>, etc.). "They loved the glory of men more than the glory of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-43.htm">John 12:43</a>). Christ then gives proofs of this spirit of ostentation in religion and in private life. <span class="cmt_word">Phylacteries</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>: literally, <span class="accented">preservatives</span>; equivalent to "amulets;" the translation of the Hebrew word <span class="accented">tephillin</span>, "prayer fillets." These were either strips of parchment or small cubes covered with leather, on or in which were written four sections of the Law, viz. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-1.htm">Exodus 13:1-10, 11-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13-21</a>. They were worn fastened either to the forehead, or inside the left arm, so as to be near the heart. Their use arose from a literal and superstitious interpretation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-9.htm">Exodus 13:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-18.htm">Deuteronomy 11:18</a>. Their dimensions were defined by rabbinical rules, but the extra pious formalists of the day set these at naught, and increased the breadth of the strips or of the bands by which they were fastened, in order to draw attention to their religiousness and their strict attention to the least observances of the Law. These phylacteries are still in use among the Jews. Thus in a 'Class Book for Jewish Youth' we read, "Every boy, three months before he attains the age of thirteen, commences to make use of the tephillin, which must be worn at least during the time of the morning prayers. The ordinance of the tephillin is one of the signs of the covenant existing between the Almighty and ourselves, that we may continually bear in mind the miracles God wrought for our forefathers." <span class="cmt_word">Enlarge the borders of their garments;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">the fringes of their outer garments.</span> The best manuscripts have merely <span class="accented">their fringes.</span> So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">magnificant fimbrias.</span> These fringes or tassels (<span class="accented">zizith, zizijoth</span>) were fastened to the corners of the garments, in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38-41</a>, and were composed of white and blue threads. They were intended to remind the wearers of the commandments of the Lord, and were regarded as peculiarly sacred (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-20.htm">Matthew 9:20</a>). Christ condemns the ostentatious enlargement of these fringes as a badge of extraordinary piety and obedience. We quote again from the Jewish 'Class. Book:' "Every male of the Jewish nation must wear a garment [not usually an undergarment] made with four corners, having fringes fixed at each corner. These fringes are called <span class="accented">tsetsis</span>, or, memorial fringes. In the synagogue, during the morning prayers, a scarf with fringes attached to it is worn, which is called <span class="accented">tollece</span>, 'scarf or veil.' These memorial fringes typically point out the six hundred and thirteen precepts contained in the volume of the sacred Law. They are also intended to remind us of the goodness of the Almighty in having delivered our forefathers from the slavery in Egypt." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-12 The scribes and Pharisees explained the law of Moses, and enforced obedience to it. They are charged with hypocrisy in religion. We can only judge according to outward appearance; but God searches the heart. They made phylacteries. These were scrolls of paper or parchment, wherein were written four paragraphs of the law, to be worn on their foreheads and left arms, Ex 13:2-10; 13:11-16; De 6:4-9; 11:13-21. They made these phylacteries broad, that they might be thought more zealous for the law than others. God appointed the Jews to make fringes upon their garments, Nu 15:38, to remind them of their being a peculiar people; but the Pharisees made them larger than common, as if they were thereby more religious than others. Pride was the darling, reigning sin of the Pharisees, the sin that most easily beset them, and which our Lord Jesus takes all occasions to speak against. For him that is taught in the word to give respect to him that teaches, is commendable; but for him that teaches, to demand it, to be puffed up with it, is sinful. How much is all this against the spirit of Christianity! The consistent disciple of Christ is pained by being put into chief places. But who that looks around on the visible church, would think this was the spirit required? It is plain that some measure of this antichristian spirit prevails in every religious society, and in every one of our hearts.</body></html>
