The received text of the Greek gives the word which means "guide," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-10.htm" title="Neither be you called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.">Matthew 23:10</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Even Christ.</span>--The words are wanting in the best MSS., and have apparently crept into the text from a marginal explanatory note, completing the sense after the pattern of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-10.htm" title="Neither be you called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.">Matthew 23:10</a>.<p><span class= "bld">All ye are brethren.</span>--The words would seem to come more naturally at the close of the next verse, and are so placed in some MSS. There is, however, a preponderance of authority in favour of this position, nor is the use of the name here without significance. The fact that men are disciples of the same Teacher constitutes in itself a bond of brotherhood.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be not ye called Rabbi.</span> After stating the customs of the Pharisees, Christ proceeds (vers. 8-12) to give his own disciples a lesson in humility. The pronoun is emphatic, "But ye, be not ye called." They are not to be eager for such distinctions, indicative of spiritual superiority. The prohibition must be understood in the spirit, and not in the letter (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-1.htm">1 Corinthians 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-2.htm">1 Timothy 1:2</a>). Our Lord does not forbid respect for teachers or different grades in his Church (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-13</a>); that which he censures is the inordinate grasping at such personal distinctions, the greedy ambition which loves the empty title, and takes any means to obtain it. <span class="cmt_word">One is your Master, even Christ.</span> The received text gives <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. Many good manuscripts read <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">Teacher</span> (so Revised Version) instead of <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">Leader</span>, [and omit <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. Both these variations seem reasonable and warranted. "Leader" has probably been introduced from ver. 10, where it occurs naturally; it is out of place here, where, for the sake of concinnity, "Teacher" is required in both parts of the sentence. And it is unlikely that Jesus should here expressly mention himself. He is speaking now of their heavenly Father; to himself he refers in ver. 10. In support of the allusion to the Father, Bengel cites <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-45.htm">John 6:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-28.htm">Acts 10:28</a>, etc. The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Unus est enim Magister vester</span>; and yet Roman Catholic commentators interpret the clause of Christ, in spite of the purposed indefiniteness of the expression. Jesus points to the inspiration of the Father or the Holy Spirit as that which teaches his disciples. They were to follow no earthly rabbi, but the heavenly Teacher. <span class="cmt_word">All ye are brethren.</span> And therefore, so far, equal. They were disciples of our Lord, and to them appertained equality and fraternity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-12 The scribes and Pharisees explained the law of Moses, and enforced obedience to it. They are charged with hypocrisy in religion. We can only judge according to outward appearance; but God searches the heart. They made phylacteries. These were scrolls of paper or parchment, wherein were written four paragraphs of the law, to be worn on their foreheads and left arms, Ex 13:2-10; 13:11-16; De 6:4-9; 11:13-21. They made these phylacteries broad, that they might be thought more zealous for the law than others. God appointed the Jews to make fringes upon their garments, Nu 15:38, to remind them of their being a peculiar people; but the Pharisees made them larger than common, as if they were thereby more religious than others. Pride was the darling, reigning sin of the Pharisees, the sin that most easily beset them, and which our Lord Jesus takes all occasions to speak against. For him that is taught in the word to give respect to him that teaches, is commendable; but for him that teaches, to demand it, to be puffed up with it, is sinful. How much is all this against the spirit of Christianity! The consistent disciple of Christ is pained by being put into chief places. But who that looks around on the visible church, would think this was the spirit required? It is plain that some measure of this antichristian spirit prevails in every religious society, and in every one of our hearts.</body></html>
