The words are, in any case, remarkable as including "scribes" no less than "prophets" among the ministers of the New Covenant. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-52.htm" title="Then said he to them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed to the kingdom of heaven is like to a man that is an householder, which brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.">Matthew 13:52</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Shall ye scourge in your synagogues.--</span>See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-17.htm" title="But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will whip you in their synagogues;">Matthew 10:17</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>.

In the parallel passage of St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-49.htm">Luke 11:49</a>) we read, "Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send." Christ is the Wisdom of God, and by his own authority gives mission to his messengers. "As the Father hath sent me, even so send I you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-21.htm">John 20:21</a>), he says to his apostles; and to such he is referring in the words which follow. <span class="cmt_word">Prophets</span>.

Not in the then Jewish sense, but instructors in the new law of life, the law of Christ's religion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-52.htm">Matthew 13:52</a>).

The passage in the Second (Fourth) Book of Esdras 1:32, which is strikingly parallel to our Lord's denunciation, may possibly be a Christian interpolation, "I sent unto you my servants the prophets, whom ye have taken and slain, and torn their bodies in pieces, whose blood I will require of your hands, saith the Lord." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:34-39 Our Lord declares the miseries the inhabitants of Jerusalem were about to bring upon themselves, but he does not notice the sufferings he was to undergo. A hen gathering her chickens under her wings, is an apt emblem of the Saviour's tender love to those who trust in him, and his faithful care of them. He calls sinners to take refuge under his tender protection, keeps them safe, and nourishes them to eternal life. The present dispersion and unbelief of the Jews, and their future conversion to Christ, were here foretold. Jerusalem and her children had a large share of guilt, and their punishment has been signal. But ere long, deserved vengeance will fall on every church which is Christian in name only. In the mean time the Saviour stands ready to receive all who come to him. There is nothing between sinners and eternal happiness, but their proud and unbelieving unwillingness.</body></html>
