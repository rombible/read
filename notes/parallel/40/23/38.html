The words "your house" may refer either generally to the whole polity of Israel, or more specifically to the "house" in which they gloried, the Temple, which was the joy of their hearts. It had been the house of God, but He, as represented by His Son, was now leaving it for ever. It was <span class= "ital">their</span> house now, not His. We must remember that the words were spoken as our Lord was "departing from the Temple" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-1.htm" title="And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple.">Matthew 24:1</a>), never to reappear there.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Your house.</span> The temple or Jerusalem, no longer God's habitation. This betokens not only Christ's solemn departure from the sacred precincts; but the withdrawal of God's Spirit from the Jewish Church and nation. <span class="cmt_word">Unto you.</span> Henceforward ye shall have it all to yourselves; my Father and I forsake it; we give it up altogether to you. <span class="cmt_word">Desolate</span>. The word is omitted by some few uncials, but retained by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, C, D, etc., most cursives, the Vulgate, etc. The protecting wing is withdrawn, the Divine presence removed, and the house is indeed deserted (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); (comp. Psalm 59:25; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-7.htm">Jeremiah 12:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:34-39 Our Lord declares the miseries the inhabitants of Jerusalem were about to bring upon themselves, but he does not notice the sufferings he was to undergo. A hen gathering her chickens under her wings, is an apt emblem of the Saviour's tender love to those who trust in him, and his faithful care of them. He calls sinners to take refuge under his tender protection, keeps them safe, and nourishes them to eternal life. The present dispersion and unbelief of the Jews, and their future conversion to Christ, were here foretold. Jerusalem and her children had a large share of guilt, and their punishment has been signal. But ere long, deserved vengeance will fall on every church which is Christian in name only. In the mean time the Saviour stands ready to receive all who come to him. There is nothing between sinners and eternal happiness, but their proud and unbelieving unwillingness.</body></html>
