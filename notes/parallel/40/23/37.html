As with a sad prescience our Lord speaks of the sufferings which were in store for His messengers, and of which the deaths of Stephen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-60.htm" title="And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.">Acts 7:60</a>) and of James (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-2.htm" title="And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.">Acts 12:2</a>) were representative instances. That the persecution in each case took a wider range, was in the nature of the case inevitable. It is distinctly stated, indeed, that it did so in both instances (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-1.htm" title="And Saul was consenting to his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.">Acts 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-1.htm" title="Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.">Acts 12:1</a>), and is implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="For you, brothers, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:">1Thessalonians 2:14-15</a>, where the "prophets" who suffered are clearly Christian prophets, and probably in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-10.htm" title="Take, my brothers, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.">James 5:10</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Even as a hen gathereth her chickens.</span>--The words reproduce (if we follow the English version), under an image of singular tenderness, the similitude of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-11.htm" title="As an eagle stirs up her nest, flutters over her young, spreads abroad her wings, takes them, bears them on her wings:">Deuteronomy 32:11</a>, the care of the hen for her chickens taking the place of that of the eagle for her nestlings. Possibly, however, the contrast between the two images lies in the English rather than the Greek, where we have the generic term, "as a bird gathereth her brood." The words "how often" may be noted as implying (though they occur in the Gospels that confine themselves to our Lord's Galilean ministry) a yearning pity for Jerusalem, such as we naturally associate with the thought of His ministry in that city.<p><span class= "bld">Ye would not.</span>--No words could more emphatically state man's fatal gift of freedom, as shown in the power of his will to frustrate the love and pity, and therefore the will, even of the Almighty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Jerusalem, Jerusalem!</span> Pathetic iteration! As he approached the city on another occasion Christ had used the same words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-34.htm">Luke 13:34, 35</a>); he repeats them now as he takes his final farewell He speaks with Divine tenderness, yet with poignant sorrow, knowing that this last appeal will be in vain. It has been remarked that, whereas St. Matthew elsewhere names the capital city, the theocratic centre, Hierosolyma, which is the Greek equivalent, he here calls it Hierousalem, which is Hebrew, as though, while recording the words used by Jesus, he desired to reproduce the actual sound of the Saviour's affecting address. <span class="cmt_word">Killest...stonest.</span> Such is thy wont, thy evil practice. So Christ says elsewhere, "It cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-33.htm">Luke 13:33</a>). "Stonest" was particularly appropriate after the reference to Zechariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Sent unto thee.</span> The received Greek is, <span class="accented">sent unto it</span> or <span class="accented">her</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>), though some manuscripts and the Vulgate give "thee." But the change of persons is not uncommon. Alford quotes <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-45.htm">Luke 1:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-34.htm">Luke 13:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-24.htm">Revelation 18:24</a>. <span class="cmt_word">How often!</span> Some would confine Christ's allusion to his own mission in Judaea, and the efforts made by him to win disciples; but it surely applies to all the doings and visitations of God towards Israel during the whole course of their history, which showed his gracious desire that all should be saved, if they only had willed with him. He hereby asserts himself as one with the God of the Old Testament. Christ's ministry in Jerusalem and Judaea is mentioned by St. John. <span class="cmt_word">Gathered... wings.</span> A tender similitude, which is found in the Old Testament and in classic authors. It implies love, care, and protection. Thus the psalmist prays, "Hide me under the shadow of thy wings;" "In the shadow of thy wings will I take refuge, until these calamities be overpast" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-8.htm">Psalm 17:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-1.htm">Psalm 57:1</a>); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-11.htm">Deuteronomy 32:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-5.htm">Isaiah 31:5</a>, etc. So Euripides, 'Herc. Fur.,' 72 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The children whom I cherish 'neath my wings,<br />As a bird cowering o'er her youthful brood."</span> The metaphor is peculiarly appropriate at the time, when, as Lange puts it, the Roman eagles were hovering near, and there was no hope of safety but under the Lord's wings. <span class="cmt_word">And ye would not.</span> Unmoved by warning and chastisement, impenetrable to long suffering love, ungrateful for mercies, the Jews repulsed all efforts for their amendment, and blindly pursued the course of ruin. It was always in their power to turn if they willed, but they wilfully resisted grace, and must suffer accordingly (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:34-39 Our Lord declares the miseries the inhabitants of Jerusalem were about to bring upon themselves, but he does not notice the sufferings he was to undergo. A hen gathering her chickens under her wings, is an apt emblem of the Saviour's tender love to those who trust in him, and his faithful care of them. He calls sinners to take refuge under his tender protection, keeps them safe, and nourishes them to eternal life. The present dispersion and unbelief of the Jews, and their future conversion to Christ, were here foretold. Jerusalem and her children had a large share of guilt, and their punishment has been signal. But ere long, deserved vengeance will fall on every church which is Christian in name only. In the mean time the Saviour stands ready to receive all who come to him. There is nothing between sinners and eternal happiness, but their proud and unbelieving unwillingness.</body></html>
