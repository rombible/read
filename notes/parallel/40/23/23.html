The Pharisee, in his minute scrupulosity (based, it may be, on the more general language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-30.htm" title="And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy to the LORD.">Leviticus 27:30</a>), made a point of gathering the tenth sprig of every garden herb, and presenting it to the priest. So far as this was done at the bidding of an imperfectly illumined conscience our Lord does not blame it. It was not, like the teaching as to oaths and the Corban, a direct perversion of the Law. What He did censure was the substitution of the lower for the higher. With the three examples of the "infinitely little" He contrasts the three ethical obligations that were infinitely great, "judgment, mercy, and faith." The word translated "mint" means literally the "sweet-smelling," the "fragrant."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23, 24.</span> - <span class="accented">Fifth woe</span> - against scrupulosity in trifles and neglect of weighty duties (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-42.htm">Luke 11:42</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye pay tithe of</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">ye tithe</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>mint and anise and cummin.</span> Practically, the law of tithe was enforced only in the case of the produce mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-23.htm">Deuteronomy 14:23</a> - corn, wine, and oil - but the Pharisees, in their overstrained scrupulosity, applied the law of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30</a> ("all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord's") to the smallest pot herbs, even to their leaves and stalks. "Mint" (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). Of this well known plant several species grow in Palestine; it was one of the ingredients of the sauce of bitter herbs eaten at the Paschal feast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-8.htm">Exodus 12:8</a>), and was hung up in the synagogue for its fragrance. "Anise" (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) is known to us as "dill," and is much used in medicine and for seasoning. "Cummin" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-25.htm">Isaiah 28:25, 27</a>), an umbelliferous plant, with seeds something like caraways, and used, like them, as a condiment and medicine. <span class="cmt_word">Have emitted the weightier matters of the Law.</span> The Pharisees were very far from treating important duties with the same scrupulosity which they observed in little matters. Christ particularizes these weighty duties: <span class="cmt_word">Judgment,</span> (<span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>mercy, and faith.</span> Three are named, in contrast to the three petty observances mentioned above. Christ seems to refer to the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, "What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?" (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-6.htm">Hosea 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-9.htm">Zechariah 7:9, 10</a>). Worthless are all outward observances when the moral precepts are neglected. "Judgment" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) means acting equitably to one's neighbour, hurting nobody by word or deed; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a> a man is sought "that exerciseth justice.'" Such impartiality is specially enjoined in the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>, etc.). "Mercy," loving kindness in conduct, often taught in the Pentateuch, as in the case of the widow, the stranger, and the debtor, and very different from the feeling of those who "devour widows' houses." "Faith" may mean fidelity to promises: "He that sweareth unto his neighbour and disappointeth him not, though it were to his own hindrance" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4</a>); but it is more probably taken as that belief in God without which it is not possible to please him, and which should underlie and influence all moral action (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">These</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>)... <span class="cmt_word">the other</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>). "These last" are judgment, mercy, and faith; these it was your duty to have done. "The other" refers to the tithing mentioned above. Christ does not censure this attention to minutiae. He would teach conformity to regulations made by competent authority, or conscientiously felt to be binding, even though not distinctly enjoined in Scripture (see vers. 2, 3); his blame is reserved for that expenditure of zeal on trifles which stood in the place of, or left no strength for, higher duties. It was a very elastic conscience which tithed a pot herb and neglected judgment. <span class="cmt_word">Strain at a gnat;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span>. "At" is supposed to be a misprint for "out." Thus Revised Version, and early English versions, <span class="accented">which strain out the gnat</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">excolantes culicem.</span> Alford thinks the present reading was an intentional alteration, meaning "strain (out the wine) at (the occurrence of) a gnat" - which seems more ingenious than probable. If "at" be retained, it must be taken as expressive of the fastidiousness which had to make a strong effort to overcome its distaste at this little insect. The wine, before drinking, was carefully strained through linen (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>, "strained wine," Septuagint) to avoid the accidental violation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-20.htm">Leviticus 11:20, 23</a>, etc.; Leviticus 17:10-14, by swallowing an unclean insect. The practice, which was in some sense a religious act, is found among the Buddhists in Hindostan and Ceylon, either to avoid pollution or to obviate the danger of taking life, which their code forbids. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>camel</span>. The gnat and the camel, which were alike unclean, stand at the extremities of the scale of comparative size. Our Lord uses a proverbial expression to denote the inconsistency which would avoid the smallest ceremonial defilement, but would take no account of the gravest moral pollution. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:13-33 The scribes and Pharisees were enemies to the gospel of Christ, and therefore to the salvation of the souls of men. It is bad to keep away from Christ ourselves, but worse also to keep others from him. Yet it is no new thing for the show and form of godliness to be made a cloak to the greatest enormities. But dissembled piety will be reckoned double iniquity. They were very busy to turn souls to be of their party. Not for the glory of God and the good of souls, but that they might have the credit and advantage of making converts. Gain being their godliness, by a thousand devices they made religion give way to their worldly interests. They were very strict and precise in smaller matters of the law, but careless and loose in weightier matters. It is not the scrupling a little sin that Christ here reproves; if it be a sin, though but a gnat, it must be strained out; but the doing that, and then swallowing a camel, or, committing a greater sin. While they would seem to be godly, they were neither sober nor righteous. We are really, what we are inwardly. Outward motives may keep the outside clean, while the inside is filthy; but if the heart and spirit be made new, there will be newness of life; here we must begin with ourselves. The righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees was like the ornaments of a grave, or dressing up a dead body, only for show. The deceitfulness of sinners' hearts appears in that they go down the streams of the sins of their own day, while they fancy that they should have opposed the sins of former days. We sometimes think, if we had lived when Christ was upon earth, that we should not have despised and rejected him, as men then did; yet Christ in his Spirit, in his word, in his ministers, is still no better treated. And it is just with God to give those up to their hearts' lusts, who obstinately persist in gratifying them. Christ gives men their true characters.</body></html>
