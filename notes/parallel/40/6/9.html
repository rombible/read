In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-2.htm" title="And he said to them, When you pray, say, Our Father which are in heaven, Hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.">Luke 11:2</a> we have the more definite, "When ye pray, say, . . . ."<p><span class= "bld">Our Father.</span>--It is clear that the very word "Abba" (<span class= "ital">father</span>) uttered by our Lord here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-36.htm" title="And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to you; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what you will.">Mark 14:36</a>, so impressed itself on the minds of men that, like "Amen" and "Hallelujah" and "Hosanna," it was used in the prayers even of converts from heathenism and Hellenistic Judaism. From its special association with the work of the Spirit in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm" title="For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but you have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.">Romans 8:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm" title="And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.">Galatians 4:6</a>, it would seem to have belonged to the class of utterances commonly described as the "tongues," in which apparently words from two or more languages were mingled together according as each best expressed the devout enthusiasm of the worshipper.<p>The thought of the Fatherhood of God was not altogether new. He had claimed "Israel as His son, even His firstborn" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm" title="And you shall say to Pharaoh, Thus said the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:">Exodus 4:22</a>), had loved him as His child (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-9.htm" title="They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.">Jeremiah 31:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-1.htm" title="When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.">Hosea 11:1</a>). The thought of an outraged Fatherhood underlies the reproaches of Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm" title="Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD has spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.">Isaiah 1:2</a>) and Malachi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-6.htm" title="A son honors his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is my honor? and if I be a master, where is my fear? said the LORD of hosts to you, O priests, that despise my name. And you say, Wherein have we despised your name?">Malachi 1:6</a>). "Thou, O Lord, art our Father" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-8.htm" title="But now, O LORD, you are our father; we are the clay, and you our potter; and we all are the work of your hand.">Isaiah 64:8</a>) was the refuge of Israel from despair. It had become common in Jewish liturgies and forms of private prayer. As the disciples heard it, it would not at first convey to their minds thoughts beyond those with which they were thus familiar. But it was a word pregnant with a future. Time and the teaching of the Spirit were to develop what was now in germ. That it had its ground in the union with the Eternal Son, which makes us also sons of God; that it was a name that might be used, not by Israelites only, but by every child of man; that of all the names of God that express His being and character, it was the fullest and the truest--this was to be learnt as men were guided into all the truth. Like all such names, it had its inner and its outer circles of application. It was true of all men, true of all members of the Church of Christ, true of those who were led by the Spirit, in different degrees; but all true theology rests on the assumption that the ever-widening circles have the same centre, and that that centre is the Love of the Father.<p>The words "Our Father" are not a form excluding the use of the more personal "My Father" in solitary prayer, but they are a perpetual witness that even then we should remember that our right to use that name is no peculiar privilege of ours, but is shared by every member of the great family of God.<p><span class= "bld">Which art in heaven.</span>--The phrase, familiar as it is, has a history of special interest. (1.) In the earlier books of the Old Testament the words "Jehovah is God in heaven above and in earth beneath" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-39.htm" title="Know therefore this day, and consider it in your heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and on the earth beneath: there is none else.">Deuteronomy 4:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-11.htm" title="And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.">Joshua 2:11</a>), express His universal presence; and this was embodied also in the name of "the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth," of the earliest patriarchal faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-22.htm" title="And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up my hand to the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,">Genesis 14:22</a>). Later on, men began to be more conscious of the infinite distance between themselves and God, and represented the contrast by the thought that He was in heaven and they on earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm" title="Be not rash with your mouth, and let not your heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and you on earth: therefore let your words be few.">Ecclesiastes 5:2</a>); and this thought became a liturgical formula in the great dedication prayer of Solomon, "Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place" (l Kings 8:42, 43, <span class= "ital">et cet.;</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-21.htm" title="Listen therefore to the supplications of your servant, and of your people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear you from your dwelling place, even from heaven; and when you hear, forgive.">2Chronicles 6:21</a>, <span class= "ital">etc.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> And so, emancipated from over-close identification with the visible firmament, the phrase became current as symbolising the world visible and invisible, which is alike the dwelling-place of God, uttering in the language of poetry that which we vainly attempt to express in the language of metaphysics by such terms as the Infinite, the Absolute, the Unconditioned. (2.) We ought not to forget that the words supply at once (as in the phrase, "God of heaven," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-2.htm" title="Thus said Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he has charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.">Ezra 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/2-18.htm" title="That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.">Daniel 2:18-19</a>) a link and a contrast between the heathen and the Jew, the Aryan and Semitic races. Each alike found in the visible heaven the symbol of the invisible forces of the universe of an unseen world; but the one first identified his heaven (the Varuna of the Vedic hymns, the Ouranos of the Greeks) with that world, and then personified each several force in it, the Pantheism of the thinker becoming the Polytheism of the worshipper; whilst to the other heaven was never more than the dwelling-place of God in His undivided unity.<p><span class= "bld">Hallowed be thy name.</span>--The first expression of thought in the pattern prayer is not the utterance of <span class= "ital">our</span> wants and wishes, but that the Name of God--that which sums up all our thoughts of God--should be "hallowed," be to us and all men as a consecrated name, not lightly used in trivial speech, or rash assertion, or bitterness of debate, but the object of awe and love and adoration. The words "Jehovah, hallowed be His name," were familiar enough to all Israelites, and are found in many of their prayers, but here the position of the petition gives a new meaning to it, and makes it the key to all that follows. Still more striking is the fact, that this supplies a link between the teaching of the first three Gospels and that of the fourth. Thus the Lord Jesus taught His disciples to pray--thus, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-28.htm" title="Father, glorify your name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.">John 12:28</a>, He prayed Himself, "Father, glorify Thy name."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-13.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">pattern of prayer.</span> Parallel passage: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-2.htm">Luke 11:2-4</a>. For most suggestive remarks on the Lord's Prayer, both generally and in its greater difficulties of detail, compare by all means Chase, 'The Lord's Prayer in the Early Church:' (Cambridge Texts and Studies). Observe: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> If the prayer had already been given by the Lord in the sermon on the mount, "one of his disciples" would hardly afterwards have asked him to teach them to pray, as John also taught his disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11.htm">Luke 11</a>. l). It is much more easy, therefore, to consider that the original occasion of its utterance is recorded by St. Luke, and that it therefore did not belong to the sermon on the mount as that discourse was originally delivered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> A question that admits of a more doubtful answer is whether the more original form of the prayer is found in Matthew or in Luke. It will be remembered that in the true text of his Gospel, the latter does not record the words, "Which art in heaven," "Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth," "But deliver us from evil," besides reading "day by day" instead of "this day," "sins" instead of "debts," and "for we ourselves also forgive every one that is indebted to us" instead of" as we also have forgiven our debtors." Most writers suppose St. Matthew's form to be the original, and St. Luke's to be only a shortened form. In favour of this are the considerations that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> St. Matthew's words, "Forgive us our debts," represent an older, because parabolic, form of expression than the apparently interpretative "Forgive us our sins" in St. Luke. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> St. Matthew's words, "as we also," seem to be expanded into "for we ourselves also," in St. Luke. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> St. Luke's "day by day" occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in his writings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-47.htm">Luke 19:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>), so that it is likely to be his own phrase, and therefore less original than St. Matthew's "this day" (cf. Weiss, 'Matthiaus-Ev.,' and Page, <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, III. 7:436). On the ether hand, the words, "Which art in heaven," are so characteristic of St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32, 33</a>; cf. 12:50; 15:13; 18:10, 14, 19, 35; 23. 9), and especially of the sermon on the mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-11.htm">Matthew 7:11, 21</a>; cf. 5:45, 48; 6:14, 26, 32), that it seems more natural to suppose that this clause at least was added by him or by the authors of his sources to the original form, rather than that it was omitted by St. Luke. In connexion with this it may be pointed out how easy it was for our Lord to say only "Father" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-2.htm">Luke 11:2</a>) immediately after his own prayer to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-1.htm">Luke 11:1</a>). Taking everything into consideration, it seems reasonable to arrive at two conclusions. First, that the form in Luke presents, <span class="accented">as a whole</span>, the more primitive and original instruction of the Lord, and that that given in Matthew presents the Lord's words as fully developed, partly perhaps by himself directly, partly by his indirect guidance of Christian usage. St. Matthew's Gospel would thus at once both show the effect and be the cause of the preference for the longer form in liturgical use. Secondly, and more exactly, that both the evangelists record the prayer after it had passed through some development in different parts of the Church, St. Matthew giving it a generally later stage, but preserving one or two clauses in an earlier and better form. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After this manner therefore</span>. <span class="accented">Therefore</span>; in contrast to the heathen practice, and in the full confidence which you have in your almighty Father's intuitive knowledge of your needs. <span class="accented">After this manner</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>). Not "in these words;" but he will most closely imitate the manner who most often reminds himself of it by using the words. <span class="cmt_word">Pray ye</span>. "Ye" emphatic - ye my disciples; ye the children of such a Father. <span class="cmt_word">Our</span> <span class="cmt_word">Father</span>. In English we just lack the power to keep, with a plural possessive pronoun (contrast "father mine"), the order of Christ's words (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) which other languages possess (<span class="accented">Pater noster</span>; <span class="accented">Vater unser</span>). Christ places in the very forefront the primary importance of the recognition of spiritual relationship to God. There is no direct thought here of God as the All-Father in the modern and often deistic sense. Yet it is affirmed elsewhere in Scripture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-28.htm">Acts 17:28</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-21.htm">Luke 15:21</a>), and spiritual relationship is perhaps only possible because of the natural relationship (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>, note). <span class="accented">Our.</span> Though the prayer is here given with special reference to praying alone (ver. 6), the believer is to be reminded at once that he is joined by spiritual relationship to many others who have the same needs, etc., as himself. <span class="cmt_word">Which art in heaven</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). Added in this fuller form of the prayer (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>), on the one hand to definitely exclude the application of the words however mediately to any human teacher (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-9.htm">Matthew 23:9</a>), and on the other to remind those who pray of the awful majesty of him whom they address. "They are a <span class="accented">Sursum corda</span>; they remind us that now we have lifted up our hearts from earth and things earthly to another and a higher world" (Trench, 'Sermon on the Mount'). <span class="cmt_word">Hallowed be thy name</span>. The first of the three prayers for the furtherance of God's cause. Their parallelism is seen much more clearly in the Greek than in the English order of the words. Thy name. We look on a name almost as an accidental appendage by which a person is designated, but in its true idea it is the designation of a person which exactly answers to his nature and qualities. Hence the full Name of God is properly that description of him which embraces all that he really is. As, however, the term "name" implies that it is expressed, it must, when it is used of God, be limited to that portion of his nature and qualities which can be expressed in human terms, because it has been already made known to us. The "name" of God, here and elsewhere in the Bible, therefore, does not mean God in his essence, but rather that manifestation of himself which he has been pleased to give, whether partial and preparatory as under the old covenant (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-26.htm">Genesis 4:26</a> [16:13]; 32:29; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-5.htm">Exodus 34:5</a>), or final as under the new (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-6.htm">John 17:6</a>); or again (to take another division found in Exell's 'Biblical Illustrator,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) the manifestation of himself through nature, through inspired words, through the Incarnation. Compared with the Glory (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>) "the Name expresses the revelation as it is apprehended and used by man. Man is called by the Name, and employs it. The Glory expresses rather the manifestation of the Divine as Divine, as a partial disclosure of the Divine Majesty not directly intelligble by man (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-18.htm">Exodus 33:18</a>, ft.)" (Bishop Westcott,' Add. Note' on <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1.htm">3 John 1:7</a>). <span class="accented">Hallowed be.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f09;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> cannot here, as sometimes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-11.htm">Revelation 22:11</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>), mean "be made holy," for this God's manifestation of himself already is; but "be counted holy," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in human judgment. The prayer is that God's manifestation of himself may be acknowledged and revered as the one supreme standard of truth and the one means of knowing God and approaching him; of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>, where "<span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> obviously means 'set apart, enshrined as the object of supreme, absolute reverence, as free from all defilement and possessed of all excellence'" (Johnstone, <span class="accented">in lee.</span>); cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-23.htm">Isaiah 29:23</a>. The same thought appears to have been the basis of the early Western alternative petition (Marcion's or Tertullian's, <span class="accented">vide</span> Westcott and Herr, 'App.,' <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-2.htm">Luke 11:2</a>) for the gift of the Holy Spirit; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the address to the Father was followed by a prayer for purification by the Holy Spirit preparatory to the prayer, "Thy kingdom come." A man must accept God's manifestation of himself before he can take part in the spread of the kingdom. Gregory of Nyssa (<span class="accented">vide</span> Westcott and Herr, lee. <span class="accented">cit.</span>, and Resch, 'Agrapha,' p. 398) says distinctly, "Let thy Holy Spirit come upon us and purify us;" but he <span class="accented">substitutes</span> this prayer for the words, "Thy kingdom come." (For the support afforded by this to the theory that the Lord's Prayer circulated in a varying form, cf. Chase, <span class="accented">loc. cit</span>.) Gregory's petition, as affecting only humanity, is less comprehensive than that found m o r Gospels. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:9-15 Christ saw it needful to show his disciples what must commonly be the matter and method of their prayer. Not that we are tied up to the use of this only, or of this always; yet, without doubt, it is very good to use it. It has much in a little; and it is used acceptably no further than it is used with understanding, and without being needlessly repeated. The petitions are six; the first three relate more expressly to God and his honour, the last three to our own concerns, both temporal and spiritual. This prayer teaches us to seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and that all other things shall be added. After the things of God's glory, kingdom, and will, we pray for the needful supports and comforts of this present life. Every word here has a lesson in it. We ask for bread; that teaches us sobriety and temperance: and we ask only for bread; not for what we do not need. We ask for our bread; that teaches us honesty and industry: we do not ask for the bread of others, nor the bread of deceit, Pr 20:17; nor the bread of idleness, Pr 31:27, but the bread honestly gotten. We ask for our daily bread; which teaches us constantly to depend upon Divine Providence. We beg of God to give it us; not sell it us, nor lend it us, but give it. The greatest of men must be beholden to the mercy of God for their daily bread. We pray, Give it to us. This teaches us a compassion for the poor. Also that we ought to pray with our families. We pray that God would give it us this day; which teaches us to renew the desires of our souls toward God, as the wants of our bodies are renewed. As the day comes we must pray to our heavenly Father, and reckon we could as well go a day without food, as without prayer. We are taught to hate and dread sin while we hope for mercy, to distrust ourselves, to rely on the providence and grace of God to keep us from it, to be prepared to resist the tempter, and not to become tempters of others. Here is a promise, If you forgive, your heavenly Father will also forgive. We must forgive, as we hope to be forgiven. Those who desire to find mercy with God, must show mercy to their brethren. Christ came into the world as the great Peace-maker, not only to reconcile us to God, but one to another.</body></html>
