Of these the former is the dominant meaning in the language of the New Testament, and is that of which we must think here. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-41.htm" title="Watch and pray, that you enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.">Matthew 26:41</a>.) We are taught not to think of the temptation in which lust meets opportunity as that into which God leads us (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/1-13.htm" title="Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempts he any man:">James 1:13-14</a>); there is therefore something that shocks us in the thought of asking Him not to lead us into it. But trials of another kind, persecution, spiritual conflicts, agony of body or of spirit, these may come to us as a test or as a discipline. Should we shrink from these? An ideal stoicism, a perfected faith, would say, "No, let us accept them, and leave the issue in our Father's hands." But those who are conscious of their weakness cannot shake off the thought that they might fail in the conflict, and the cry of that conscious weakness is therefore, "Lead us not into such trials," even as our Lord prayed, "If it be possible, let this cup pass away from me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-39.htm" title="And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as you will.">Matthew 26:39</a>). And the answer to the prayer may come either directly in actual exemption from the trial, or in "the way to escape" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-13.htm" title="There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it.">1Corinthians 10:13</a>), or in strength to bear it. It is hardly possible to read the prayer without thinking of the recent experience of "temptation" through which our Lord had passed. The memory of that trial in all its terrible aspects was still present with Him, and in His tender love for His disciples He bade them pray that they might not be led into anything so awful.<p><span class= "bld">Deliver us from evil.</span>--The Greek may grammatically be either neuter or masculine, "evil" in the abstract, or the "evil one" as equivalent to the "devil." The whole weight of the usage of New Testament language is in favour of the latter meaning. In our Lord's own teaching we have the "evil one" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-19.htm" title="When any one hears the word of the kingdom, and understands it not, then comes the wicked one, and catches away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.">Matthew 13:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-38.htm" title="The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;">Matthew 13:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-15.htm" title="I pray not that you should take them out of the world, but that you should keep them from the evil.">John 17:15</a> (probably); in St. Paul's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-16.htm" title="Above all, taking the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.">Ephesians 6:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm" title="But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and keep you from evil.">2Thessalonians 3:3</a>), in St. John's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-13.htm" title="I write to you, fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one.

Added to this, there is the thought just adverted to, which leads us to connect our Lord's words with His own experience. The prayer against temptation would not have been complete without reference to the Tempter whose presence was felt in it. We may lawfully pray to be spared the trial. If it comes, there is yet room for the prayer, "Deliver us from the power of him who is our enemy and Thine."<p><span class= "bld">For thine is the kingdom. . . .</span>--The whole clause is wanting in the best MSS. and in the earlier versions, and is left unnoticed by the early Fathers, who comment on the rest of the Prayer. Most recent editors have accordingly omitted it, as probably an addition made at first (after the pattern of most Jewish prayers) for the liturgical use of the Prayer, and then interpolated by transcribers to make the text of the discourse harmonise with the liturgies.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil</span>.

This first clause is a prayer against being brought into the fulness and awfulness of temptation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a>; parallel passage's: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-38.htm">Mark 14:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-46.htm">Luke 22:46</a>). As such it cannot, indeed, always be granted, since in exceptional cases this may be part of the permission given to the prince of this world. So it was in our Lord's case (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a>, and context). The words are a cry issuing from a deep sense of our personal weakness against the powers of evil. <span class="accented">Into temptation</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> spiritual. External trials, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> persecution, may be included, but only in so far as they are the occasion of real temptation to the soul. <span class="accented">But.</span> Do not bring us into the full force of temptation, but, instead, rescue us now and at any other time from the attack of the evil one (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>). Thus this clause is more than a merely positive form of the preceding. It is a prayer against even the slightest attacks of the enemy <span class="accented">when they are made. Deliver us</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span>).

The peril is, as it were, something outside him (compare, however, Chase, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>)<span class="accented">. Evil.</span> So also the Revised Version margin; but <span class="accented">the evil one</span> (Revised Version). In itself <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> might, of course, be either neuter or masculine, but in view of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-19.htm">Matthew 13:19</a>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> the many passages in the New Testament where the expression is either certainly or probably masculine; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-13.htm">1 John 2:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-18.htm">1 John 5:18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-15.htm">John 17:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:3</a>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> the many allusions to the masculine reference of this petition shown by Bishop Lightfoot ('Revision,' etc., edit. 1891) and Mr. Chase (<span class="accented">lot. cit.</span>) to exist in early Christian literature - there seems little doubt that the Revised Version is right. Chase (<span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>) shows that the primary notion of both <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, and its Hebrew equivalent <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5e2;</span>, is not malignity (Trench), but worthless ness, essential badness. For thine is the kingdom, etc. Omitted in the Revised Ver sion on overwhelming authority (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, D, Z, Old Latin, Memphitic, "all Greek commentators on the Lord's Prayer except Chrysostom and his <span class="accented">followers</span>," Westcott and Hort, 'App., <span class="accented">q.v.</span>). In the 'Didache,' &sect;&sect; 8, 9, 10, however, we find our doxology with very little other variation than the omission of "the kingdom," this itself being explained in the two latter sections by the immediately preceding mention of the kingdom. Similar omissions of one or more of the three terms, "kingdom, power, glory," are found in the Old Syriac, an "African" text of the Old Latin, and the Thebaic. "It was probably derived ultimately from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-11.htm">1 Chronicles 29:11</a> (Hebrews), but, it may be, through the medium of some contemporary Jewish usage: the people's response to prayers in the temple is said to have been 'Blessed be the name of the glory of his kingdom for ever and ever'" (Westcott and Hort, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>). Indeed, it was so usual for doxologies of one kind or another to be added by the Jews to prayers, that, though we cannot for one moment accept the words here as genuine, we must consider it very doubtful in the Lord's Prayer was ever used in Jewish circles without a doxology, or that our Lord, as Man, ever intended it to be so used (cf. further, Taylor, 'Lectures,' p. 64). At all events, the feeling of the Christian Church in using the doxology is fully justified by its contents; for it places us more emphatically than ever in a right relation to God. By our praise to him it induces in us the remembrance that it is to God's <span class="accented">kingdom</span> that we belong, having him for King and Source of law; that it is by God's <span class="accented">power</span> that we live on earth and stand freed from Satan's grasp; that it is for the furtherance of God's <span class="accented">glory</span> that all has been done for us, all wrought in us, all these petitions are now made and all our hopes and aims are directed. Hereafter, as Bengel says. the whole prayer will be doxology: "Hallowed be the Name of our God. His kingdom has come; his will is done. He has forgiven us our sins. He has brought our temptation to an end; He has delivered us from the evil one. His is the kingdom and the power and the glory for ever. Amen." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:9-15 Christ saw it needful to show his disciples what must commonly be the matter and method of their prayer. Not that we are tied up to the use of this only, or of this always; yet, without doubt, it is very good to use it. It has much in a little; and it is used acceptably no further than it is used with understanding, and without being needlessly repeated. The petitions are six; the first three relate more expressly to God and his honour, the last three to our own concerns, both temporal and spiritual. This prayer teaches us to seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and that all other things shall be added. After the things of God's glory, kingdom, and will, we pray for the needful supports and comforts of this present life. Every word here has a lesson in it. We ask for bread; that teaches us sobriety and temperance: and we ask only for bread; not for what we do not need. We ask for our bread; that teaches us honesty and industry: we do not ask for the bread of others, nor the bread of deceit, Pr 20:17; nor the bread of idleness, Pr 31:27, but the bread honestly gotten. We ask for our daily bread; which teaches us constantly to depend upon Divine Providence. We beg of God to give it us; not sell it us, nor lend it us, but give it. The greatest of men must be beholden to the mercy of God for their daily bread. We pray, Give it to us. This teaches us a compassion for the poor. Also that we ought to pray with our families. We pray that God would give it us this day; which teaches us to renew the desires of our souls toward God, as the wants of our bodies are renewed. As the day comes we must pray to our heavenly Father, and reckon we could as well go a day without food, as without prayer. We are taught to hate and dread sin while we hope for mercy, to distrust ourselves, to rely on the providence and grace of God to keep us from it, to be prepared to resist the tempter, and not to become tempters of others. Here is a promise, If you forgive, your heavenly Father will also forgive. We must forgive, as we hope to be forgiven. Those who desire to find mercy with God, must show mercy to their brethren. Christ came into the world as the great Peace-maker, not only to reconcile us to God, but one to another.</body></html>
