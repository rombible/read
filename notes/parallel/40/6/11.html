The word translated "daily" is found nowhere else, with the one exception of the parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-3.htm" title="Give us day by day our daily bread.">Luke 11:3</a>, and so far as we can judge must have been coined for the purpose, as the best equivalent for the unknown Aramaic word which our Lord actually used. We are accordingly thrown partly on its possible derivation, partly on what seems (compatibly with its derivation) most in harmony with the spirit of our Lord's teaching. The form of the word (see Note in <span class= "ital">Excursus</span>) admits of the meanings, (1) bread sufficient for the day now coming; (2) sufficient for the morrow; (3) sufficient for existence; (4) over and above material substance--or, as the Vulgate renders it, <span class= "ital">panis super substantialis.</span> Of these, (1) and (2) are the most commonly received; and the idea conveyed by them is expressed in the rendering "daily bread." So taken, it is a simple petition, like the prayer of Agur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-8.htm" title="Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:">Proverbs 30:8</a>, for "food convenient for us;" and as such, has been uttered by a thousand child-like hearts, and has borne its witness alike against over-anxiety and far-reaching desires for outward prosperity. It is not without some hesitation, in face of so general a concurrence of authority, that I find myself constrained to say that the last meaning seems to me the truest. Let us remember (1) the words with which our Lord had answered the Tempter, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-4.htm" title="But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.">Matthew 4:4</a>); (2) His application of those words in "I have meat to eat that ye know not of" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-32.htm" title="But he said to them, I have meat to eat that you know not of.">John 4:32</a>); (3) His own use of bread as the symbol of that which sustains the spiritual life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-27.htm" title="Labor not for the meat which perishes, but for that meat which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give to you: for him has God the Father sealed.">John 6:27-58</a>); (4) the warnings in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/6-25.htm" title="Therefore I say to you, Take no thought for your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor yet for your body, what you shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?">Matthew 6:25-31</a> not only against anxiety about what we shall eat and drink, but against <span class= "ital">seeking</span> these things instead of seeking simply the kingdom of God and His righteousness--and we can scarcely fail, I think, to see that He meant His disciples, in this pattern Prayer, to seek for the nourishment of the higher and not the lower life. So taken, the petition, instead of being a contrast to the rest of the Prayer, is in perfect harmony with it, and the whole raises us to the region of thought in which we leave all that concerns our earthly life in the hands of our Father, without asking Him even for the supply of its simplest wants, seeking only that He would sustain and perfect the higher life of our spirit. So when we ask for "daily bread," we mean not common food, but the "Bread from heaven, which giveth life unto the world." So the reality of which the Eucharistic bread is the symbol is the Lord's gracious answer to the Prayer He has taught us.<p><span class= "bld">II.</span>--<span class= "bld">THE WORD "DAILY," IN Matthew 6:11.</span><p>The word <span class= "greekheb"></span>?<span class= "greekheb">????</span>?<span class= "greekheb">????</span> has been derived (1) from <span class= "greekheb"><span class= "ital">? ??????? </span></span>(<span class= "ital">sc.</span> <span class= "greekheb">?????</span>)<span class= "ital">=the</span> day that is coming on; and this meaning is favoured by the fact that Jerome says that the Hebrew Gospel current in his time gave the word m<span class= "ital">ahar</span> (= <span class= "ital">crastinus</span>) to-morrow's bread, and by the very early rendering, <span class= "ital">quotidianum,</span> in the Latin versions. On the other hand, this meaning introduces a strange tautology into St. Luke's version of the prayer, "Give us day by day--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> daily--our daily bread." (2) The other derivation connects it with <span class= "greekheb"><span class= "ital">?????</span></span> in some one or other of its many senses, and with <span class= "greekheb">??? </span>as signifying either "for" or "over"--the former force of the preposition suggesting the thought "for our existence or subsistence;" the latter, the <span class= "ital">supersubstantialis</span> of Jerome, that is, "over or above our material substance." It is said, and with truth, that in classical Greek the form would have been not <span class= "greekheb">?????????</span>, but <span class= "greekheb">????????</span>; but it is clear that that difficulty did not prevent a scholar like Jerome from accepting the derivation, and it was not likely that the Hellenistic Jew who first translated our Lord's discourses should be more accurate than Jerome in coining a word which seemed to him wanted to express our Lord's meaning. The derivation being then admissible, it remains to ask which of the two meanings of <span class= "greekheb">?????</span> and of <span class= "greekheb">??? </span>gives most force to the clause in which the word occurs, and for the reasons given above I am led to decide in favour of the latter. New words would hardly have been wanted for the meanings "daily" or "sufficient." When a word is coined, it may fairly be assumed that it was wanted to express a new thought, and the new thought here was that which our Lord afterwards developed in John 6, that the spirit of a man needs sustenance not less than his body, and that that sustenance is found in the "bread of God which cometh down from heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-33.htm" title="For the bread of God is he which comes down from heaven, and gives life to the world.">John 6:33</a>). The student should, however, consult Dr. Lightfoot's admirable excursus on the word in his <span class= "ital">Hints on a Revised Version of the New Testament.</span><p>On the assumption that the Lord's Prayer included and spiritualised the highest thoughts that had previously been expressed separably by devout Israelites, we may note, as against the meaning of "bread for the morrow," the saying of Rabbi Elieser, that "He who has a crumb left in his scrip, and asks, 'What shall I eat to-morrow?' belongs to those of little faith."<p>There is, it must be admitted, a difficulty in conjecturing what Aramaic word could have answered to this meaning of <span class= "greekheb">?????????</span><span class= "ital">,</span> and the fact that a word giving the other meaning is, as it were, ready to hand, and was actually found in the Hebrew Gospel in the fourth century, has some weight on the other side. That word may, however, itself have been not a translation of the original, but a re-translation of the Latin <span class= "ital">quotidianus;</span> and the fact that Jerome, knowing of this, chose another rendering here, while he retained <span class= "ital">quotidianus</span> in St. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-3.htm" title="Give us day by day our daily bread.">Luke 11:3</a>, shows that he was not satisfied with it, and at last, it may be, halted between two opinions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Give us this day our daily</span> <span class="cmt_word">bread</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> Here begin the petitions for our personal needs.

The chief and fatal objection to both <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> is that the form would be <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. especially Lightfoot. <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>, p. 201). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>, "to come;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> with direct reference to "bread" - our "successive," "continual," "ever-coming" bread (so the Old Syriac, and partly the Egyptian versions), that which comes as each supply is required; the prayer then meaning, "Our bread as it is needed give us to-day" (so apparently Dr. Taylor, 'Sayings,' etc., p. 140); (b) derived mediately from <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3be;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> (cf. Acts 16:11; 20:15; 21:18), "bread for the coming day," i.e. the same day, if the prayer be said in the morning; the next day if it be said in the evening (so Bishop Lightfoot). Between (3) (a) and (3) (b) it is very difficult to decide. Against (a) is the fact that it is hard to say why the common form ejpi>onta would not have served; against (b), while the use of the word is perfectly consistent with casting all care upon God for to-morrow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-34.htm">Matthew 6:34</a>), there still remains the fact that there is some tautology in saying, "Our bread for the coming day give us to-day," or even the formula in the parallel passage in Luke, "Our bread for the coming day give us day by day." On the whole, perhaps (3) (a) presents the least difficulties. Bread. It is very doubtful if to use this petition of spiritual food is anything more than a legitimate application (made, indeed, as early as the 'Didache,' &sect; 10.) of words which in themselves refer only to material food (see further Chase, loc. cit.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:9-15 Christ saw it needful to show his disciples what must commonly be the matter and method of their prayer. Not that we are tied up to the use of this only, or of this always; yet, without doubt, it is very good to use it. It has much in a little; and it is used acceptably no further than it is used with understanding, and without being needlessly repeated. The petitions are six; the first three relate more expressly to God and his honour, the last three to our own concerns, both temporal and spiritual. This prayer teaches us to seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and that all other things shall be added. After the things of God's glory, kingdom, and will, we pray for the needful supports and comforts of this present life. Every word here has a lesson in it. We ask for bread; that teaches us sobriety and temperance: and we ask only for bread; not for what we do not need. We ask for our bread; that teaches us honesty and industry: we do not ask for the bread of others, nor the bread of deceit, Pr 20:17; nor the bread of idleness, Pr 31:27, but the bread honestly gotten. We ask for our daily bread; which teaches us constantly to depend upon Divine Providence. We beg of God to give it us; not sell it us, nor lend it us, but give it. The greatest of men must be beholden to the mercy of God for their daily bread. We pray, Give it to us. This teaches us a compassion for the poor. Also that we ought to pray with our families. We pray that God would give it us this day; which teaches us to renew the desires of our souls toward God, as the wants of our bodies are renewed. As the day comes we must pray to our heavenly Father, and reckon we could as well go a day without food, as without prayer. We are taught to hate and dread sin while we hope for mercy, to distrust ourselves, to rely on the providence and grace of God to keep us from it, to be prepared to resist the tempter, and not to become tempters of others. Here is a promise, If you forgive, your heavenly Father will also forgive. We must forgive, as we hope to be forgiven. Those who desire to find mercy with God, must show mercy to their brethren. Christ came into the world as the great Peace-maker, not only to reconcile us to God, but one to another.</body></html>
