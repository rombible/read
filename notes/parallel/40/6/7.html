Formed from a word which reproduces the repeated attempts of the stammerer to clothe his thoughts in words, it might be almost rendered, "Do not stutter out your prayers, do not babble them over." The words describe only too faithfully the act of prayer when it becomes mechanical. The devotion of the rosary, in which every bead is connected with a Pater Noster or an Ave Maria, does but reproduce the eighteen prayers of the Rabbis, which they held it to be an act of religion to repeat. On the other hand, it is clear that the law of Christ does not exclude the iteration of intense emotion. That is not a "vain repetition;" and in the great crisis of His human life our Lord Himself prayed thrice "using the same words" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-44.htm" title="And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.">Matthew 26:44</a>). How far our use of the Lord's Prayer, or of the Kyrie Eleison of our Litanies, is open to the charge of "vain repetition" is another question. It is obvious that it may easily become so to any mechanical worshipper of the Pharisaic type; but there is, on the other side, an ever-accumulating weight of evidence from really devout souls, that they have found it helpful in sustaining the emotion without which prayer is dead.<p><span class= "bld">As the heathen do.</span>--We know too little of the details of the ritual of classical heathenism to be able to say how far the charge of vain repetition applied at this time to them. The cries of the worshippers of Baal "from morning even until noon" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-26.htm" title="And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped on the altar which was made.">1Kings 18:26</a>), the shouts of those of Artemis at Ephesus "for the space of two hours" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-34.htm" title="But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.">Acts 19:34</a>), may be taken as representative instances.<p><span class= "bld">Their much speaking.</span>--This thought was the root-evil of the worship of the heathen or the Pharisee. It gave to prayer a quantitative mechanical force, increased in proportion to the number of prayers offered. If fifty failed, a hundred might succeed. But this assumed that the object of prayer was to change the will of God, or to inform Him of what He did not know before, and our Lord teaches us--as, indeed, all masters of the higher life have taught--that that assumption vitiates prayer at once.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But when</span> <span class="cmt_word">ye pray</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>). The Revised Version, <span class="accented">and in praying</span>, shows that our Lord is only continuing the subject, and not turning to a new one, as in vers. 2, 5, 16. But while he has thus far thought of prayer as an external act, he now speaks of the substance of the prayers offered, the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span> indicating a transition to another aspect of the same subject. Use not vain repetitions; "Babble not much" (Tyndale).

The Peshito employs here the same root () as for <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-32.htm">Mark 7:32</a> (). But from the primary sense of stuttering, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, naturally passed to that of babbling in senseless repetitions. <span class="cmt_word">As the heathen do</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, <span class="accented">Gentiles</span>, Revised Version; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-47.htm">Matthew 5:47</a>, note). Thinking that the virtue lies in the mere utterance of the words. Even the Jews came perilously near this in their abundant use of synonyms and synonymous expressions in their prayers (cf. Lightfoot, 'Hor. Hebr.'). Perhaps it was this fact that assisted the introduction of the reading "hypocrites" in B and the Old Syriac. <span class="cmt_word">For they think that they shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">be heard for their much speaking.</span> In the continuance (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>) of their external action lies their hope of being fully heard (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:5-8 It is taken for granted that all who are disciples of Christ pray. You may as soon find a living man that does not breathe, as a living Christian that does not pray. If prayerless, then graceless. The Scribes and Pharisees were guilty of two great faults in prayer, vain-glory and vain repetitions. Verily they have their reward; if in so great a matter as is between us and God, when we are at prayer, we can look to so poor a thing as the praise of men, it is just that it should be all our reward. Yet there is not a secret, sudden breathing after God, but he observes it. It is called a reward, but it is of grace, not of debt; what merit can there be in begging? If he does not give his people what they ask, it is because he knows they do not need it, and that it is not for their good. So far is God from being wrought upon by the length or words of our prayers, that the most powerful intercessions are those which are made with groanings that cannot be uttered. Let us well study what is shown of the frame of mind in which our prayers should be offered, and learn daily from Christ how to pray.</body></html>
