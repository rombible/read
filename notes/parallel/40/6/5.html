What our Lord's words point to, was the custom of going into the synagogue, as men go now into the churches of Latin Christendom, to offer private devotion (as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in the parable of the Pharisee and the publican), and of doing this so as to attract notice, the worshipper standing apart as if absorbed in prayer, while secretly glancing round to watch the impression which he might be making on others who were looking on.<p><span class= "bld">In the corners of the streets.</span>--Not the same word as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-3.htm" title="But when you do alms, let not your left hand know what your right hand does:">Matthew 6:3</a>, but the broad, open places of the city. There, too, the Pharisees might be seen, reciting their appointed prayers--probably the well-known eighteen acts of devotion which were appointed for the use of devout Israelites--and with the <span class= "ital">tallith</span> or veil of prayer over their head.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-15.</span> - <span class="accented">Prayer.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-8.</span> - Matthew only. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be</span>, etc.; Revised Version, plural. Ver. 5 is addressed to the disciples generally, ver. 6 to them individually. (For the future, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-48.htm">Matthew 5:48</a>, note.) <span class="cmt_word">As the hypocrites are</span> (ver. 2, note). The 'Didache,' &sect; 8, following this passage, says, "Neither pray ye as the hypocrites," referring, like our Lord, to practices affected chiefly by the Pharisees. <span class="cmt_word">For they love</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>). Not to be translated "they are wont." Our Lord points out the cause of this their custom. It was not that the synagogue was more convenient (he is, of course, thinking of their private prayers), or that they were accidentally overtaken by the prayer-hour when in the street, but their innate love of display made them choose these places "that they may be seen of men" (cf. ver. 16, and contrast ver. 2). <span class="cmt_word">To pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets</span>; <span class="accented">to stand and pray</span>, etc. (Revised Version), giving, however, slightly more emphasis on "stand" than its position warrants.

(For the practice here condemned by our Lord, cf. Lightfoot, 'Hor. Hebr.,' "R. Jochauau said, I saw R. Jannai standing and praying in the streets of Tsippor, and going four cubits, and then praying the Additionary Prayer.") <span class="cmt_word">They have,</span> etc. (ver. 2, note). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:5-8 It is taken for granted that all who are disciples of Christ pray. You may as soon find a living man that does not breathe, as a living Christian that does not pray. If prayerless, then graceless. The Scribes and Pharisees were guilty of two great faults in prayer, vain-glory and vain repetitions. Verily they have their reward; if in so great a matter as is between us and God, when we are at prayer, we can look to so poor a thing as the praise of men, it is just that it should be all our reward. Yet there is not a secret, sudden breathing after God, but he observes it. It is called a reward, but it is of grace, not of debt; what merit can there be in begging? If he does not give his people what they ask, it is because he knows they do not need it, and that it is not for their good. So far is God from being wrought upon by the length or words of our prayers, that the most powerful intercessions are those which are made with groanings that cannot be uttered. Let us well study what is shown of the frame of mind in which our prayers should be offered, and learn daily from Christ how to pray.</body></html>
