Publicity may be a duty, especially in public work. But this--gifts for schools, hospitals, and the like--is hardly contemplated in the word "alms," which refers rather to acts of mercy, to cases of individual suffering. Ostentation in those acts is what our Lord especially condemns.<p><span class= "bld">Thy Father which seeth in secret.</span>--The attribute which we call the Omniscience of God is commonly dwelt on as calculated to inspire a just fear of the All-seeing One. He sees, we say, the evil deeds that are done in secret. Here it is brought before us as an encouragement and ground of hope. Do we feel isolated, not understood, not appreciated? He sees in secret and will reward.<p><span class= "bld">Shall reward thee openly.</span>--A curious instance of an early attempt to improve on our Lord's teaching. The adverb "openly" is not found in the best MSS., and is now omitted by most editors. It would seem either as if a false rhetorical taste desired a more complete antithesis, or that the craving for public acknowledgment in the presence of men and angels asserted itself even here, and led men to add to the words of the divine Teacher. It need hardly be said that the addition weakens and lowers the force of the truth asserted. It is not necessarily in this way, "openly," that God rewards His servants, nor do the words point only to the reward of the last great day. The reward is at once immediate, and, it may be, secret--the hidden manna, the joy with which a stranger doth not intermeddle, and which no man taketh from us.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thy Father which seeth in secret</span> (comp. ver. 6, note). <span class="cmt_word">Himself</span>. Revised 'Version omits, with the manuscripts. <span class="cmt_word">Shall reward thee</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">shall recompense thee</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). Shall give to thee in full measure corresponding to the contents of that which is really due (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-6.htm">Isaiah 65:6, 7</a>, LXX.). When this" recompense" shall be given is not stated. If, as is probable, our Lord is thinking of the" reward" of ver. 1 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a>, it would naturally be given at the judgment-day. <span class="cmt_word">Openly</span>. Revised Version omits, with the manuscripts; similarly vers. 6,18. The interpolation was probably made not only because of the contrast suggested by "in secret," but also to indicate more precisely the time when God would do this. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-4 Our Lord next warned against hypocrisy and outward show in religious duties. What we do, must be done from an inward principle, that we may be approved of God, not that we may be praised of men. In these verses we are cautioned against hypocrisy in giving alms. Take heed of it. It is a subtle sin; and vain-glory creeps into what we do, before we are aware. But the duty is not the less necessary and excellent for being abused by hypocrites to serve their pride. The doom Christ passes, at first may seem a promise, but it is their reward; not the reward God promises to those who do good, but the reward hypocrites promise themselves, and a poor reward it is; they did it to be seen of men, and they are seen of men. When we take least notice of our good deeds ourselves, God takes most notice of them. He will reward thee; not as a master who gives his servant what he earns, and no more, but as a Father who gives abundantly to his son that serves him.</body></html>
