In most cases, there will be love for the one, and a real hatred for the other. The man who loves God cannot love the evil world, and, so far as it is evil, will learn to hate it. The man who loves the world will, even in the midst of lip-homage, hate the service of God in his inmost heart. But there are natures which seem hardly susceptible of such strong emotions as love or hatred. In that case there will be a like though not an identical, issue. The man's will will drift in one direction or another. He will cleave to one with such affection as he is capable of, and will hold the other cheap. God or mammon, not both together, will be the ruling power with him.<p><span class= "bld">Mammon.</span>--The word means in Syriac "money" or "riches," and is used in this sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-9.htm" title="And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when you fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.">Luke 16:9</a>. It occurs frequently in the Chaldee Targum, but no word resembling it is found in the Hebrew of the Old Testament. In the fourth century Jerome found it in use in Syria, and Augustine in the Punic dialect of his native country. There is no ground for believing that it ever became the name of any deity, who, like the Plutus of the Greeks, was worshipped as the god of wealth. Here, there is obviously an approach to a personification for the sake of contrasting the service or worship of money with that which is due to God. Milton's description of Mammon among the fallen angels is a development of the same thought (<span class= "ital">Par. Lost, I.</span> 678).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">No man can serve two masters</span>, etc. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-13.htm">Luke 16:13</a> the saying is found almost word for word immediately after the parable of the unjust steward. As the word "mammon" comes twice in that parable, but nowhere else in the New Testament, it is probable that its occurrence caused the insertion of this saying in that place (cf. ver. 22, note). <span class="accented">No man can serve two masters.</span> The thought is still of earnestness of purpose and singleness of heart. Our Lord here speaks of the impossibility of such divided service as he has been warning his disciples against attempting. No man can give due service to two masters. For, apart from the extent of the claim of each master - total bond-service (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) - thorough service of two masters is incompatible with the effects produced upon the servant himself. The result of service is to incline him towards the one master and against the other. Notice how our Lord continues his plan of setting forth the moral effect of modes of thought or action upon the agents themselves (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For either he will hate the one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">and love the other.</span> Because human nature is such that it must attach itself to one of two principles. "Cor hominis neque its vacuum esse potest, ut non serviat <span class="accented">ant Dee aut</span> creaturae: neque simul duobus servire" (Bengel). <span class="cmt_word">Or else he will hold to</span> <span class="cmt_word">the one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). The Revised Version omits "the." The stress here is on "one - not both." <span class="accented">Hold to</span>; in steadfast application (cf. Ellicott, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-9.htm">Titus 1:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye cannot serve God and mammon</span>; "Ye moun not serve god and ricchesse" (Wickliffe). A repetition of the statement of the impossibility of serving two masters, but more than a repetition, for it is enforced by defining who the masters are. <span class="accented">Mammon.</span> The change in the Revised Version from a capital to a small <span class="accented">m</span> has probably been made to prevent "mammon" being understood as the proper name of some god. The derivation of the word (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5d0;</span>) is very doubtful. The most probable suggestion is that it is formed from the stem of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span>, and is equivalent to that which is apportioned or counted (cf. Levy, 'Neuheb. Worterb.,' <span class="accented">s.v.</span>; Edersheim, 'Life,' 2. p. 269). Hence its well-known meaning of property, wealth, especially money. Observe that our Lord does not here contrast God and Satan; he is emphasizing the thought which he has been adducing since ver. 19, viz., the relation that his disciples must hold to things of earth, which are summed up by him under the term "mammon" as with us under the term "wealth." Observe also that it is not the possession of wealth that he condemns, but the serving it, making it an object of thought and pursuit. Gathering it and using it in the service of and according to the will of God is not serving mammon (cf. Weiss, 'Matthaus-Ev.'). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:19-24 Worldly-mindedness is a common and fatal symptom of hypocrisy, for by no sin can Satan have a surer and faster hold of the soul, under the cloak of a profession of religion. Something the soul will have, which it looks upon as the best thing; in which it has pleasure and confidence above other things. Christ counsels to make our best things the joys and glories of the other world, those things not seen which are eternal, and to place our happiness in them. There are treasures in heaven. It is our wisdom to give all diligence to make our title to eternal life sure through Jesus Christ, and to look on all things here below, as not worthy to be compared with it, and to be content with nothing short of it. It is happiness above and beyond the changes and chances of time, an inheritance incorruptible. The worldly man is wrong in his first principle; therefore all his reasonings and actions therefrom must be wrong. It is equally to be applied to false religion; that which is deemed light is thick darkness. This is an awful, but a common case; we should therefore carefully examine our leading principles by the word of God, with earnest prayer for the teaching of his Spirit. A man may do some service to two masters, but he can devote himself to the service of no more than one. God requires the whole heart, and will not share it with the world. When two masters oppose each other, no man can serve both. He who holds to the world and loves it, must despise God; he who loves God, must give up the friendship of the world.</body></html>
