A duty unfulfilled is a debt unpaid. Primarily, therefore, the words "our debts" represent sins of omission, and "trespasses" the transgression of a law, sins of commission. The distinction, however, though convenient, is more or less technical. Every transgression implies the non-fulfilment of duty in a more aggravated form, and the memory of both presents itself to the awakened conscience under the character of an ever-accumulating debt. Even the sins against our neighbour are, in this sense, debts which we have incurred to God; and as the past cannot be undone, they are debts which we can never pay. For us, therefore, the one helpful prayer is, "Forgive the debt," and the gospel which our Lord proclaimed was, that the Father was ready to forgive. The confession of the debt was enough to ensure its remission, and then there was to come the willing service of a grateful love instead of the vain attempt, which Pharisaism encouraged, to score up an account of good works, as part payment, and therefore as a set-off, reducing the amount of debt. The parables of the Two Debtors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-41.htm" title="There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.">Luke 7:41</a>) and of the Unforgiving Creditor whose own debt had been forgiven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/18-23.htm" title="Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened to a certain king, which would take account of his servants.">Matthew 18:23-35</a>) were but expansions of the thought which we find in its germ in this clause of the Lord's Prayer.<p>In striking contrast with that clause is the claim of merit which insinuates itself so readily into the hearts of those who worship without the consciousness that they need forgiveness, and which uttered itself in the daring prayer attributed to Apollonius of Tyana, "Give me that which is my due--pay me, ye gods, the debts ye owe to me."<p><span class= "bld">As we forgive our debtors.</span>--The better reading gives, <span class= "ital">We have forgiven,</span> as a completed act before we begin to pray. In the very act of prayer we are taught to remind ourselves of the conditions of forgiveness. Even here, in the region of the free grace of God, there is a law of retribution. The temper that does not forgive cannot be forgiven, because it is <span class= "ital">ipso facto</span> a proof that we do not realise the amount of the debt we owe. We forget the ten thousand talents as we exact the hundred pence, and in the act of exacting we bring back that burden of the greater debt upon ourselves.<p>Up to this point, in the petitions of the Lord's Prayer, we may think of the Man Christ Jesus as having not only taught the Prayer, but Himself used it. During the years of youth and manhood it may well have been thus far the embodiment of the outpourings of His soul in communion with His Father. Even the prayer, "Give us this day our daily bread," whether we take it in its higher or its lower meaning, would be the fit utterance of His sense of dependence as the Son of Man. Can we think the same of the prayer, "Forgive us our debts?" It is, of course, opposed to the whole teaching of Scripture to believe that there dwelt on His human spirit the memory of a single transgression. In the fullest sense of the word He was without sin, the Just One, needing no repentance. And yet the analogy of those of His saints and servants who have followed most closely in the footsteps of His holiness may lead us to think it possible that even these words also may have had a meaning in which He could use them. In proportion as men attain holiness and cease to transgress, they gain a clearer perception of the infinite holiness of God, and seek to be made partakers of it. They would fain pray and praise and work for Him evermore, but though the spirit is willing, the flesh is weak. They are weary and faint, and they become more intensely conscious of the limits of their human powers as contrasted with the limitless range of their desires. In this sense, therefore, and strictly in reference to the limitations of the true, yet absolutely sinless, humanity which He vouchsafed to assume, it is just conceivable that He too Himself may have used this prayer. And we must remember also that He prayed as the Brother of mankind, as the representative of the race. The intensity of His sympathy with sinners, which was the condition of His atoning work (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-15.htm" title="For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.">Hebrews 4:15</a>), would make Him, though He knew no sin, to identify Himself with sinners. He would feel as if their transgressions were His transgressions, their debts His debts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors</span>. <span class="accented">Forgive</span>; a change in God's relation to us and our sins.

It is probable that Matthew took one meaning, perhaps the more primary, and Luke another, perhaps the more secondary (cf. Gesenius, Thes,' <span class="accented">s.v.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span>, and Professor Marshall, <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, IV. 3:281), of the original Aramaic word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;</span>); but, as "debtors" comes in the next clause, it seems reasonable to suppose that Matthew represents the sense in which our Lord intended the word to be understood. Luke may have avoided it as too strongly Hebraic a metaphor, even though he does use <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of men in relation to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-4.htm">Luke 13:4</a>).

The singular, especially with "debtors" following, would very naturally be corrupted to the plural. Sins are termed "debts," as not rendering to God his due (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-21.htm">Matthew 22:21</a>; cf. 25:27). <span class="accented">As we</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">as we also</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). In the same way as we have - a comparison of fact, not of proportion (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-13.htm">Matthew 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-33.htm">Matthew 18:33</a>). (For the thought, cf. Ecclus. 28:2.) Luke's "for we ourselves also" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>) lays more stress on our forgiving others being a <span class="accented">reason</span> for God forgiving us. <span class="accented">Forgive</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">have forgiven</span>, in the past (aorist). Luke's present is of the habit. <span class="accented">Our debtors.</span> Luke individualizes (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:9-15 Christ saw it needful to show his disciples what must commonly be the matter and method of their prayer. Not that we are tied up to the use of this only, or of this always; yet, without doubt, it is very good to use it. It has much in a little; and it is used acceptably no further than it is used with understanding, and without being needlessly repeated. The petitions are six; the first three relate more expressly to God and his honour, the last three to our own concerns, both temporal and spiritual. This prayer teaches us to seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and that all other things shall be added. After the things of God's glory, kingdom, and will, we pray for the needful supports and comforts of this present life. Every word here has a lesson in it. We ask for bread; that teaches us sobriety and temperance: and we ask only for bread; not for what we do not need. We ask for our bread; that teaches us honesty and industry: we do not ask for the bread of others, nor the bread of deceit, Pr 20:17; nor the bread of idleness, Pr 31:27, but the bread honestly gotten. We ask for our daily bread; which teaches us constantly to depend upon Divine Providence. We beg of God to give it us; not sell it us, nor lend it us, but give it. The greatest of men must be beholden to the mercy of God for their daily bread. We pray, Give it to us. This teaches us a compassion for the poor. Also that we ought to pray with our families. We pray that God would give it us this day; which teaches us to renew the desires of our souls toward God, as the wants of our bodies are renewed. As the day comes we must pray to our heavenly Father, and reckon we could as well go a day without food, as without prayer. We are taught to hate and dread sin while we hope for mercy, to distrust ourselves, to rely on the providence and grace of God to keep us from it, to be prepared to resist the tempter, and not to become tempters of others. Here is a promise, If you forgive, your heavenly Father will also forgive. We must forgive, as we hope to be forgiven. Those who desire to find mercy with God, must show mercy to their brethren. Christ came into the world as the great Peace-maker, not only to reconcile us to God, but one to another.</body></html>
