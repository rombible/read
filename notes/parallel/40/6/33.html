What is thus to be sought is "the kingdom of God" (the change from the less personal "kingdom of heaven" is significant), the higher spiritual life in its completeness, for ourselves and for others; and with it we are to seek "His righteousness," that which, being perfect beyond the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, must be His gift to us, and therefore to be sought in prayer. One who seeks for this may well be content to leave all else in his Father's hands. Even without his asking "they shall be added unto him" in such measure as is best for him. Among the few traditional sayings ascribed to our Lord of which we can think as probably an authentic report of His teaching, is one to the same effect quoted by Origen and Clement of Alexandria," Ask great things, and little things shall be added to you: ask heavenly things, and earthly things shall be added to you."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-31.htm">Luke 12:31</a>, which is shorter. <span class="cmt_word">But</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in contrast to such seeking as he has just spoken cf. Our Lord at length gives a distinct promise that if God's cause is made the first aim, all the necessaries of life shall be provided. <span class="cmt_word">Seek ye first</span>. The difference between <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> here and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 32 seems to be only that the latter points out more clearly the direction of the search. <span class="accented">First.</span> If the search for earthly things be put into a secondary place, it may be allowable. <span class="cmt_word">The kingdom of God, and his righteousness</span>; <span class="accented">his kingdom and his righteousness</span> (Revised Version). "Of God" must almost certainly be omitted with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">B</span>); cf. Westcott and Hort, 'App.' The first phrase represents rather the external, the second the internal aim. Seek ye the spread and accomplishment of God's kingdom; seek ye personal conformity to his standard of righteousness. Both thoughts are of fundamental importance for this "sermon" (<span class="accented">kingdom</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3, 10, 19, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-10.htm">Matthew 6:10</a>; <span class="accented">righteousness</span>, especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17-20</a>), which treats essentially of the way in which the subjects of the Divine <span class="accented">kingdom</span> should regard the Divine <span class="accented">righteousness</span> and conform to it. And all these things shall be added unto you; cf. the apocryphal saying of our Lord, repeated by Origen (Clem. Alex.), "Jesus said to his disciples, <span class="accented">Ask great things</span>, <span class="accented">and the small shall be added to you</span>; <span class="accented">and ask heavenly things</span>, <span class="accented">and the earthly shall be added to you"</span> (Westcott, 'Introd.,' App. C; Resch, 'Agrapha,' p. 230, etc.; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-11.htm">1 Kings 3:11-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-29.htm">Mark 10:29, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:25-34 There is scarcely any sin against which our Lord Jesus more warns his disciples, than disquieting, distracting, distrustful cares about the things of this life. This often insnares the poor as much as the love of wealth does the rich. But there is a carefulness about temporal things which is a duty, though we must not carry these lawful cares too far. Take no thought for your life. Not about the length of it; but refer it to God to lengthen or shorten it as he pleases; our times are in his hand, and they are in a good hand. Not about the comforts of this life; but leave it to God to make it bitter or sweet as he pleases. Food and raiment God has promised, therefore we may expect them. Take no thought for the morrow, for the time to come. Be not anxious for the future, how you shall live next year, or when you are old, or what you shall leave behind you. As we must not boast of tomorrow, so we must not care for to-morrow, or the events of it. God has given us life, and has given us the body. And what can he not do for us, who did that? If we take care about our souls and for eternity, which are more than the body and its life, we may leave it to God to provide for us food and raiment, which are less. Improve this as an encouragement to trust in God. We must reconcile ourselves to our worldly estate, as we do to our stature. We cannot alter the disposals of Providence, therefore we must submit and resign ourselves to them. Thoughtfulness for our souls is the best cure of thoughtfulness for the world. Seek first the kingdom of God, and make religion your business: say not that this is the way to starve; no, it is the way to be well provided for, even in this world. The conclusion of the whole matter is, that it is the will and command of the Lord Jesus, that by daily prayers we may get strength to bear us up under our daily troubles, and to arm us against the temptations that attend them, and then let none of these things move us. Happy are those who take the Lord for their God, and make full proof of it by trusting themselves wholly to his wise disposal. Let thy Spirit convince us of sin in the want of this disposition, and take away the worldliness of our hearts.</body></html>
