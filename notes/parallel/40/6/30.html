The scarcity of wood in Palestine made the latter use more common there than in Europe. The "oven" in this passage was the portable earthen vessel used by the poor for baking their bread. The coarse ligneous hay was placed below it and round it, and short-lived as the flame was, so that "the crackling of the thorns" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-12.htm" title="They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.">Psalm 118:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-6.htm" title="For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.">Ecclesiastes 7:6</a>) became proverbial, it had time to do its work.<p><span class= "bld">O ye of little faith.</span>--The word is found only in our Lord's teaching, and the passages in which it occurs are all singularly suggestive. The disciples were not faithless or unbelieving, but their trust was weak. They lacked in moments of anxiety the courage which leads men to rely implicitly on the love and wisdom of their Father. So in the stormy night on the lake, or when Peter began to sink in the waves, or when the disciples had forgotten to take bread, the same word recurs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-26.htm" title="And he said to them, Why are you fearful, O you of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.">Matthew 8:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-31.htm" title="And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said to him, O you of little faith, why did you doubt?">Matthew 14:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-8.htm" title="Which when Jesus perceived, he said to them, O you of little faith, why reason you among yourselves, because you have brought no bread?">Matthew 16:8</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-28.htm">Luke 12:28</a> with slight differences.

This often insnares the poor as much as the love of wealth does the rich. But there is a carefulness about temporal things which is a duty, though we must not carry these lawful cares too far. Take no thought for your life. Not about the length of it; but refer it to God to lengthen or shorten it as he pleases; our times are in his hand, and they are in a good hand. Not about the comforts of this life; but leave it to God to make it bitter or sweet as he pleases. Food and raiment God has promised, therefore we may expect them. Take no thought for the morrow, for the time to come. Be not anxious for the future, how you shall live next year, or when you are old, or what you shall leave behind you. As we must not boast of tomorrow, so we must not care for to-morrow, or the events of it. God has given us life, and has given us the body. And what can he not do for us, who did that? If we take care about our souls and for eternity, which are more than the body and its life, we may leave it to God to provide for us food and raiment, which are less. Improve this as an encouragement to trust in God. We must reconcile ourselves to our worldly estate, as we do to our stature. We cannot alter the disposals of Providence, therefore we must submit and resign ourselves to them. Thoughtfulness for our souls is the best cure of thoughtfulness for the world. Seek first the kingdom of God, and make religion your business: say not that this is the way to starve; no, it is the way to be well provided for, even in this world. The conclusion of the whole matter is, that it is the will and command of the Lord Jesus, that by daily prayers we may get strength to bear us up under our daily troubles, and to arm us against the temptations that attend them, and then let none of these things move us. Happy are those who take the Lord for their God, and make full proof of it by trusting themselves wholly to his wise disposal. Let thy Spirit convince us of sin in the want of this disposition, and take away the worldliness of our hearts.</body></html>
