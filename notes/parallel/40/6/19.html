Lay up treasure indeed, but in the right place (cf. a still more striking case in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-27.htm">John 6:27</a>); observe that in both cases it is "for yourselves." Lightfoot ('Hor. Hebr.,' on ver. 1) quotes an interesting Haggada from Talm. Jeremiah,' Peah,' 15b (equivalent to Talm. Bob., 'Baba Bathra,' 11<span class="accented">a</span>), in which "Monobazes, the king," when blamed for giving so much to the poor, defends himself at length: "My fathers laid up their wealth on earth; I lay up mine in heaven," etc. But our Lord here does not mean to limit his reference to almsgiving. He thinks of all that has been mentioned since <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a> (cf. Weiss) as affording means of heavenly wealth. Upon earth; <span class="accented">upon the earth</span> (Revised Version). Our Lord here wishes to emphasize the locality as such (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>): in ver. 20 rather the nature and quality of the locality (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff7;</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Where moth</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-2.htm">James 5:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-8.htm">Isaiah 51:8</a>, especially LXX.). Either directly or by its larvae, whether the treasure be clothes or food. Or rust. Any power that eats, or corrodes, or wastes (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Doth</span> <span class="cmt_word">corrupt</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">doth consume.</span> "Corrupt" "has now a moral significance, which does not in any degree appertain to the Greek" (Humphry). <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> (ver. 16, note) is here used of the complete change in the appearance or even of the complete destruction caused by these slow but sure enemies of earthly wealth. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">where thieves.</span> Before, physical or non-responsible agents; here, human beings. <span class="cmt_word">Break through</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); "dig through" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-43.htm">Matthew 24:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-39.htm">Luke 12:39</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-16.htm">Job 24:16</a>, LXX.). Where the houses are so frequently made of mud or sun-burnt bricks, this would be comparatively easy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:19-24 Worldly-mindedness is a common and fatal symptom of hypocrisy, for by no sin can Satan have a surer and faster hold of the soul, under the cloak of a profession of religion. Something the soul will have, which it looks upon as the best thing; in which it has pleasure and confidence above other things. Christ counsels to make our best things the joys and glories of the other world, those things not seen which are eternal, and to place our happiness in them. There are treasures in heaven. It is our wisdom to give all diligence to make our title to eternal life sure through Jesus Christ, and to look on all things here below, as not worthy to be compared with it, and to be content with nothing short of it. It is happiness above and beyond the changes and chances of time, an inheritance incorruptible. The worldly man is wrong in his first principle; therefore all his reasonings and actions therefrom must be wrong. It is equally to be applied to false religion; that which is deemed light is thick darkness. This is an awful, but a common case; we should therefore carefully examine our leading principles by the word of God, with earnest prayer for the teaching of his Spirit. A man may do some service to two masters, but he can devote himself to the service of no more than one. God requires the whole heart, and will not share it with the world. When two masters oppose each other, no man can serve both. He who holds to the world and loves it, must despise God; he who loves God, must give up the friendship of the world.</body></html>
