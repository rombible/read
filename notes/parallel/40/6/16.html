Under the Law there had been but the one great fast of the Day of Atonement, on which men were "to afflict their souls" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-27.htm" title="Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation to you; and you shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire to the LORD.">Leviticus 23:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-7.htm" title="And you shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an holy convocation; and you shall afflict your souls: you shall not do any work therein:">Numbers 29:7</a>) and practice had interpreted that phrase as meaning total abstinence from food. Other fasts were occasional, in times of distress or penitence, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-14.htm" title="Sanctify you a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God, and cry to the LORD,">Joel 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-15.htm" title="Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:">Joel 2:15</a>; or as part of a policy affecting to be religious zeal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-9.htm" title="And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:">1Kings 21:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-12.htm" title="They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.">1Kings 21:12</a>); or as the expression of personal sorrow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-34.htm" title="So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.">1Samuel 20:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-16.htm" title="David therefore sought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the earth.">2Samuel 12:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-6.htm" title="Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.">Ezra 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-4.htm" title="And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,">Nehemiah 1:4</a>; <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> These were observed with an ostentatious show of affliction which called forth the indignant sarcasm of the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-5.htm" title="Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? will you call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?">Isaiah 58:5</a>). The "sackcloth" took the place of the usual raiment, "ashes" on the head, of the usual unguents (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-1.htm" title="Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackcloths, and earth on them.">Nehemiah 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-13.htm" title="But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into my own bosom.">Psalm 35:13</a>). The tradition of the Pharisees starting from the true principle that fasting was one way of attaining self-control, and that as a discipline it was effectual in proportion as it was systematic, fixed on the fasts "twice in the week," specified in the prayer of the Pharisee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-12.htm" title="I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.">Luke 18:12</a>); and the second and fifth days of the week were fixed, and connected with some vague idea that Moses went up Mount Sinai on the one, and descended on the other. Our Lord, we may note, does not blame the principle, or even the rule, on which the Pharisees acted. He recognises fasting, as He recognises almsgiving and prayer, and is content to warn His disciples against the ostentation that vitiates all three, the secret self-satisfaction under the mask of contrition, the "pride that apes humility." The very words, "when thou fastest" contain an implied command.<p><span class= "bld">Of a sad countenance.</span>--Strictly, <span class= "ital">of sullen look, </span>the moroseness of affected austerity rather than of real sorrow.<p><span class= "bld">They disfigure their faces.</span>--The verb is the same as that translated "corrupt" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-19.htm" title="Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust does corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:">Matthew 6:19</a>.

(On the prominence given to fasting, see 'Psalms of Solomon,' 3:9, with Ryle's and James's note, and Schurer, II. 2:118; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-14.htm">Matthew 9:14</a>.)

The early Jewish Christians are bidden in the 'Didache' to avoid the fasting-days chosen by the Jews. <span class="accented">Be not.</span> Our Lord does not forbid even this sad countenance if it be, so to speak, natural; but do not, because you fast, therefore purposely become so (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in sign of your supposed sorrow for sin (cf.

As ver. 19 is peculiar to Matthew, and ver. 20 is a corollary to it though in part found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-33.htm">Luke 12:33</a>, the whole passage vers. 16-20 is probably either due to the author of the First Gospel or else derived by him from some one source. In this connexion it may be noticed that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> comes in the New Testament only in ver. 18 (twice).
