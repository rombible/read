Epicurean self-indulgence, Stoic apathy, practical common-sense, have all preached the same lesson, and bidden men to cease their questionings about the future. That which was new in our Lord's teaching was the ground on which the precept rested. It was not simply the <span class= "ital">carpe diem</span>--"make the most of the present"--of the seeker after a maximum of enjoyment, nor the acceptance by man's will of an inevitable destiny, nor the vain struggle to rise above that inevitable fate. Men were to look forward to the future calmly, to avoid the temper<p>"Over-exquisite<p>To cast the fashion of uncertain evils,"<p>because they had a Father in heaven who cared for each one of them with a personal and individualising love.<p><span class= "bld">Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</span>--The word rendered "evil" occurs in the Gospels only in this passage, and in the Epistles has commonly the sense of "wickedness." That meaning would be too strong here; but it reminds us that our Lord is speaking not of what we call the simple accidents or misfortunes of life, but of the troubling element which each day brings with it, and against which we have to contend, lest it should lead us into sin. That conflict is more than enough for the day, without anticipating a further mischief.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take</span> <span class="cmt_word">therefore no thought for</span> the <span class="cmt_word">morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof</span>. Matthew only. Luke's conclusion to this section ("Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom") is perhaps more closely connected with the preceding verse, and also grander as dwelling upon God's side; but Matthew's is more practical, dealing with the subject from man's side. Christ says, "Because all needful things shall be added, do not have one anxious thought for the future, even for what is coming on the very next day." Such anxiety shows a want of common sense, for each day brings its own burden of anxiety for itself. Christ here seems to allow anxiety for each day <span class="accented">as it comes round.</span> "But," he says, "put off your to-morrow's anxiety until to-morrow." If this be done, the greater part of all our anxiety is put aside at once, and, for the rest of it, the principle will apply to each hour as well as to each day (cf. Bengel). The Christian will ever try to follow the inspired advice of St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>) and St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>). <span class="accented">The morrow shall take thought for</span>; "be anxious" as <span class="accented">supra. The things of itself</span>; <span class="accented">for itself</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f51;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>. The unique construction of the genitive after <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> led to the insertion of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> by the copyists (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-32.htm">1 Corinthians 7:32-34</a>). <span class="accented">Sufficient unto the day</span>, etc.; Tyndale, "For the day present hath ever enough of his own trouble." <span class="accented">Sufficient</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-25.htm">Matthew 10:25</a>, note). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:25-34 There is scarcely any sin against which our Lord Jesus more warns his disciples, than disquieting, distracting, distrustful cares about the things of this life. This often insnares the poor as much as the love of wealth does the rich. But there is a carefulness about temporal things which is a duty, though we must not carry these lawful cares too far. Take no thought for your life. Not about the length of it; but refer it to God to lengthen or shorten it as he pleases; our times are in his hand, and they are in a good hand. Not about the comforts of this life; but leave it to God to make it bitter or sweet as he pleases. Food and raiment God has promised, therefore we may expect them. Take no thought for the morrow, for the time to come. Be not anxious for the future, how you shall live next year, or when you are old, or what you shall leave behind you. As we must not boast of tomorrow, so we must not care for to-morrow, or the events of it. God has given us life, and has given us the body. And what can he not do for us, who did that? If we take care about our souls and for eternity, which are more than the body and its life, we may leave it to God to provide for us food and raiment, which are less. Improve this as an encouragement to trust in God. We must reconcile ourselves to our worldly estate, as we do to our stature. We cannot alter the disposals of Providence, therefore we must submit and resign ourselves to them. Thoughtfulness for our souls is the best cure of thoughtfulness for the world. Seek first the kingdom of God, and make religion your business: say not that this is the way to starve; no, it is the way to be well provided for, even in this world. The conclusion of the whole matter is, that it is the will and command of the Lord Jesus, that by daily prayers we may get strength to bear us up under our daily troubles, and to arm us against the temptations that attend them, and then let none of these things move us. Happy are those who take the Lord for their God, and make full proof of it by trusting themselves wholly to his wise disposal. Let thy Spirit convince us of sin in the want of this disposition, and take away the worldliness of our hearts.</body></html>
