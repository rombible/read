The fact that it reappears there is significant as to the prominence, in our Lord's thoughts and teaching, of the whole cycle of imagery on which it rests. Here the opening words, "How think ye?" sharpen its personal application to the disciples, as an appeal to their own experience. Even in this shorter form the parable involves the claim on our Lord's part to be the true Shepherd, and suggests the thought that the "ninety and nine" are (1) strictly, the unfallen creatures of God's spiritual universe; and (2) relatively, those among men who are comparatively free from gross offences.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - The parable that follows teaches the same lesson as the preceding verse. It is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-1.htm">Luke 15:1-7</a>, with some variations, delivered to a different audience and under different circumstances, as Jesus often repeated his instructions and teaching according to the occasion. <span class="cmt_word">How think ye?</span> What say ye to the following case? Thus the Lord engages the disciples' attention. <span class="cmt_word">An hundred sheep.</span> A round number, representing a considerable flock. If but one of these stray, the good Shepherd regards only the danger and possible destruction of this wanderer, and puts aside every other care in order to secure its safety. <span class="cmt_word">The ninety and nine.</span> These must be left for a time, if he is to conduct the search in person. It may he that some idea of probation is here intended, as when Jesus let the disciples embark on the lake while he himself remained on the shore. Many of the Fathers interpret the ninety-nine as representing the sinless angels, the lost sheep as man, to seek and save whom Christ left heaven, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. became incarnate. This, indeed, may be a legitimate application of the parable, but is inexact as an exposition of the passage, which regards the whole flock as figuring the human race. The sheep that remained safe and true to their Master are the righteous; the errant are the sinners, which, however few, are the special care of the merciful Lord. <span class="cmt_word">Into the mountains</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f54;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;</span>). There is much doubt whether these words are to be joined with <span class="cmt_word">goeth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span>), as in both our versions, or with <span class="cmt_word">leave</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span>), as in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Nonne</span> <span class="accented">relinquit nonaginta novem in montibus?</span> In the former case we have a picture of the toil of the shepherd traversing the mountains in search of the lost. But this does not seem to be the particular point contemplated, nor is any special emphasis assigned to this part of the transaction. In the parable as recounted by St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4</a>), we read, "Doth he not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go?" So here it is best to render, <span class="accented">Doth he not leave the ninety and nine upon the mountains?</span> The shepherd is not regardless of the safety and comfort of the flock during his temporary absence; he leaves them where they are sure to find pasture, as they roam over (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> with accusative) the hill tops, which, catching clouds and dew, are never without fresh grass. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-8.htm">Psalm 147:8</a>, "Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains." <span class="cmt_word">Seeketh</span>. The lost sheep would not return of itself. Such erring souls Jesus seeks by the inspiration of his Spirit, by allowing distress and sorrow, by awakening conscience and memory, by ways manifold which may lead the sinner to "come to himself." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:7-14 Considering the cunning and malice of Satan, and the weakness and depravity of men's hearts, it is not possible but that there should be offences. God permits them for wise and holy ends, that those who are sincere, and those who are not, may be made known. Being told before, that there will be seducers, tempters, persecutors, and bad examples, let us stand on our guard. We must, as far as lawfully we may, part with what we cannot keep without being entangled by it in sin. The outward occasions of sin must be avoided. If we live after the flesh, we must die. If we, through the Spirit, mortify the deeds of the body, we shall live. Christ came into the world to save souls, and he will reckon severely with those who hinder the progress of others who are setting their faces heavenward. And shall any of us refuse attention to those whom the Son of God came to seek and to save? A father takes care of all his children, but is particularly tender of the little ones.</body></html>
