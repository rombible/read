(1.) The presence of "offences" implies sin, and the question arises how each man is to deal with those sins which affect himself personally. (2.) The dispute in which the teaching recorded in this chapter had originated implied that the unity of the society which was then represented by the Twelve, had for the time been broken. Each of the disciples thought himself, in some sense, aggrieved by others. Sharp words, it may be, had been spoken among them, and the breach had to be healed.<p><span class= "bld">Go and tell him his fault.</span>--The Greek is somewhat stronger, <span class= "ital">convict him of his fault,</span> press it home on him in such a way as to reach his reason and his conscience. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-8.htm" title="And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:">John 16:8</a>.) But this is to be done "between thee and him alone." Angry words spoken in the presence of others would fail of that result. It is significant that the substance of the precept is taken from the passage in Leviticus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/19-17.htm" title="You shall not hate your brother in your heart: you shall in any wise rebuke your neighbor, and not suffer sin on him.">Leviticus 19:17-18</a>) which ends with "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."<p><span class= "bld">Thou hast gained thy brother.</span>--The words in part derive their force from the subtle use of a word in one sense which men associated commonly with another. "Gain" of some kind, aimed at, or wrongfully withheld, was commonly the origin of disputes and litigation. A man hoped to reap some profit by going to law. In the more excellent way which our Lord points out, he would by sacrificing the lower gain, attain the higher, and win for God (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-19.htm" title="For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant to all, that I might gain the more.">1Corinthians 9:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-1.htm" title="Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;">1Peter 3:1</a>, for this aspect of the word) and for himself the brother with whom he had been at variance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-20.</span> - <span class="accented">Correction of an offending brother</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - Hitherto the discourse has warned against offending the young and weak; it now teaches how to behave when the offence is directed against one's self. <span class="cmt_word">Moreover</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>, "now," introducing a new subject) <span class="cmt_word">if thy brother shall trespass against</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;</span>). The brother is a brother in the faith, a fellow Christian. The words, "against thee," are omitted in the Sinaitic and Vatican Manuscripts, and by some modern editors, on the ground that it is a gloss derived from Peter's question (ver. 21). The words are retained by the Vulgate and other high authorities. Without them, the passage becomes one of a general nature, applying to all offences. Retaining them, we find a direction how to treat one who offers personal offence to ourselves - which seems to suit the context best. In the case of private quarrels between individual Christians, with the view of reconciliation, there are four steps to be taken. First, private remonstrance: <span class="cmt_word">Go</span>. Do not wait for him to come to you; make the first advances yourself. This, as being the more difficult course, is expressly enjoined on one who is learning the lesson of humility. <span class="cmt_word">Tell him his fault;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>,: <span class="accented">corripe eum</span>. Put the fault plainly before him, show him how he has wronged you, and how he has offended God. This must be done in private, gently, mercifully. Such treatment may win the heart, while public rebuke, open denunciation, might only incense and harden. Plainly, the Lord primarily contemplates quarrels between individual Christians; though, indeed, the advice here and in the sequel is applicable to a wider sphere and to more important occasions. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast gained thy brother.</span> If he shall own his fault, and ask for pardon, thou hast won him for God and thyself. A quarrel is a loss to both parties; a reconciliation is a gain for both. The verb "to gain" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>) is used elsewhere in this high sense (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-19.htm">1 Corinthians 9:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:15-20 If a professed Christian is wronged by another, he ought not to complain of it to others, as is often done merely upon report, but to go to the offender privately, state the matter kindly, and show him his conduct. This would generally have all the desired effect with a true Christian, and the parties would be reconciled. The principles of these rules may be practised every where, and under all circumstances, though they are too much neglected by all. But how few try the method which Christ has expressly enjoined to all his disciples! In all our proceedings we should seek direction in prayer; we cannot too highly prize the promises of God. Wherever and whenever we meet in the name of Christ, we should consider him as present in the midst of us.</body></html>
