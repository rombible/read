The words at least help us to understand the more mysterious language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-3.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.">John 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-5.htm" title="Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.">John 3:5</a>, as to the "new birth" of water and the Spirit, which one, at least, of the disputants must, in all likelihood, have heard.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Except ye be converted</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. turned from proud, ambitious thoughts of worldly dignity. There is no question here about what is popularly known as conversion - the change from habitual sin to holiness. The conversion here spoken of is confined to a change in the present state of mind - to a new direction given to the thoughts and wishes. The apostles had shown rivalry, jealousy, ambition: they must turn away from such failings, and learn a different lesson. <span class="cmt_word">Become as little children.</span> Christ points to little children as the model to which the members of his kingdom must assimilate themselves. The special attributes of children which he would recommend are humility, unworldliness, simplicity, teachableness, - the direct contraries of self-seeking, worldliness, distrust, conceit. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall not enter.</span> In the sermon on the mount Christ had said, "Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>). To all who are not such the gate opens not. That virtue which was unknown to pagan antiquity, the opposite character to which was upholden as the acme of excellence, Christ here asserts to be the only passport to his ideal Church on earth or its eternal development in heaven. Not the self-esteeming, proud man (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) of Aristotle's worship ('Eth. Nic.,' 4:3), but the humble (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>), the lowly, the self-depreciating, is the man who can realize his position in the spiritual world, and shall be admitted to its blessings and benefits. St. Paul has summarized the ideal character of the members of the kingdom in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>, especially vers. 4, 5, and 7. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-6 Christ spoke many words of his sufferings, but only one of his glory; yet the disciples fasten upon that, and overlook the others. Many love to hear and speak of privileges and glory, who are willing to pass by the thoughts of work and trouble. Our Lord set a little child before them, solemnly assuring them, that unless they were converted and made like little children, they could not enter his kingdom. Children, when very young, do not desire authority, do not regard outward distinctions, are free from malice, are teachable, and willingly dependent on their parents. It is true that they soon begin to show other dispositions, and other ideas are taught them at an early age; but these are marks of childhood, and render them proper emblems of the lowly minds of true Christians. Surely we need to be daily renewed in the spirit of our minds, that we may become simple and humble, as little children, and willing to be the least of all. Let us daily study this subject, and examine our own spirits.</body></html>
