Those who pray must be gathered together in the name of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-20.htm" title="For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the middle of them.">Matthew 18:20</a>), <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> as trusting to His intercession, asking a prayer which is not the utterance of the natural but the spiritual man, asking it in entire submission to the will of their Father in heaven. In the absence of those conditions, as in the prayer of the sons of Zebedee, asking they knew not what (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-20.htm" title="Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.">Matthew 20:20</a>), that which they desired might be withheld from them, or granted in quite another manner than that on which they had set their hearts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Again I say unto you.</span> The following paragraph has been thought by many to be addressed especially to the apostles in confirmation of the powers conferred on them above; but from ver. 20 we should judge the promise to be general. Herein is set forth the privilege of united prayer. God confirms the sentence of his authorized ambassadors; he gives special heed to the joint intercessions of all Christians. <span class="cmt_word">Two of you.</span> Two of my followers, even the smallest number that could form an association. <span class="cmt_word">Shall agree</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). Be in complete accord, like the notes of a perfect strain of music. Here one man's infirmity is upheld by another's strength; one man's short-sightedness compensated by another's wider view; this man's little faith overpowered by that man's firm confidence. <span class="cmt_word">Anything</span>. Of course, this is to be understood with some restriction. The thing asked must be reasonable, good in itself, expedient for the petitioner; the prayer must be earnest, faithful, persevering. If such conditions are satisfied, the desire will be granted in some form, though, perhaps, not in the way or at the time expected. Thus the Lord sanctions guilds or bodies of Christians united together to offer up supplications for special objects or with some definite intention in which all ere agreed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:15-20 If a professed Christian is wronged by another, he ought not to complain of it to others, as is often done merely upon report, but to go to the offender privately, state the matter kindly, and show him his conduct. This would generally have all the desired effect with a true Christian, and the parties would be reconciled. The principles of these rules may be practised every where, and under all circumstances, though they are too much neglected by all. But how few try the method which Christ has expressly enjoined to all his disciples! In all our proceedings we should seek direction in prayer; we cannot too highly prize the promises of God. Wherever and whenever we meet in the name of Christ, we should consider him as present in the midst of us.</body></html>
