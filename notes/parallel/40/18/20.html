The strength of the Christian society was not to be measured by a numerical standard, but by its fulfilment of the true conditions of its life. The presence of Christ was as true and mighty, His communion with His Church as real, when His followers were but as a remnant, as when they were gathered in the great congregation. He would be with the "two or three" (there is, perhaps, a special reference to the self-same words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-16.htm" title="But if he will not hear you, then take with you one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.">Matthew 18:16</a>), to plead for them as the great High Priest, to impart Himself to them, to ratify their decisions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - The promise is applied to the public prayer of the congregation, as we see in what is called "the prayer of St. Chrysostom" in the English Prayer book. <span class="cmt_word">Are gathered together.</span> For the purpose of worship. It is a simpler form of the word used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>, "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together." <span class="cmt_word">In my Name</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">into my Name</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. with love to me, yearning for union with me, and acting for my glory. This would imply decent and orderly meeting for the highest ends. <span class="cmt_word">There am I in the midst of them.</span> Christ promises a real, actual presence, though invisible, as true as when he appeared to his disciples after his resurrection, as true as when the Shechinah shone in tabernacle or temple. The rabbis had a saying that if two sat at table and conversed about the Law of God, the Shechinah rested upon them. The promise in the text, of course, implies Christ's omnipresence and omniscience. This is his blessing on united, congregational prayer. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:15-20 If a professed Christian is wronged by another, he ought not to complain of it to others, as is often done merely upon report, but to go to the offender privately, state the matter kindly, and show him his conduct. This would generally have all the desired effect with a true Christian, and the parties would be reconciled. The principles of these rules may be practised every where, and under all circumstances, though they are too much neglected by all. But how few try the method which Christ has expressly enjoined to all his disciples! In all our proceedings we should seek direction in prayer; we cannot too highly prize the promises of God. Wherever and whenever we meet in the name of Christ, we should consider him as present in the midst of us.</body></html>
