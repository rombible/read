The secret of true greatness lay in that unconsciousness of being great, which takes the lowest position as that which of right belongs to it. For a man to "humble himself" with the purpose of attaining greatness would frustrate itself, and reduce humility to an hypocrisy. The "pride that apes humility," the false lowliness of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>, is even more hateful and contemptible than open self-assertion.<p><span class= "bld">As this little child.</span>--That which was to be the result of a deliberate act in the disciples was found in the child's nature as it was. They were to make themselves lowly as he was lowly. The transition from the plural to the singular gives an almost dramatic vividness to the form of our Lord's teaching. We seem to see the child shrinking timidly, with blushing face and downcast eyes, from the notice thus drawn to him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever therefore.</span> This verse gives a direct application of the principle just enunciated, and supplies an answer to the apostles' question. <span class="cmt_word">Shall humble himself.</span> Not that a child consciously humbles itself, but is humble by nature. The disciple must become that by deliberate choice which the child is by reason of his constitution and natural disposition. <span class="cmt_word">The same is</span> <span class="cmt_word">greatest;</span> rather, <span class="accented">greater</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), Christ using the same term as the questioners in ver. 1. The more a man annihilates self and casts away pride, conceit, obstinacy, the fitter is he to become a living member of Christ's kingdom. "Quanto humilior, tanto altior," says Thomas Aquinas. But this is a joint work. St. Gregory says well, "The good which a man doeth is both the work of God and the work of man: of God, as being the Author, in giving grace; of man, as being actor, in using grace, yet so that he cooperate with grace by grace" (quoted by Ford, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-6 Christ spoke many words of his sufferings, but only one of his glory; yet the disciples fasten upon that, and overlook the others. Many love to hear and speak of privileges and glory, who are willing to pass by the thoughts of work and trouble. Our Lord set a little child before them, solemnly assuring them, that unless they were converted and made like little children, they could not enter his kingdom. Children, when very young, do not desire authority, do not regard outward distinctions, are free from malice, are teachable, and willingly dependent on their parents. It is true that they soon begin to show other dispositions, and other ideas are taught them at an early age; but these are marks of childhood, and render them proper emblems of the lowly minds of true Christians. Surely we need to be daily renewed in the spirit of our minds, that we may become simple and humble, as little children, and willing to be the least of all. Let us daily study this subject, and examine our own spirits.</body></html>
