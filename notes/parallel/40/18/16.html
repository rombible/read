As the previous verse implied a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-17.htm" title="You shall not hate your brother in your heart: you shall in any wise rebuke your neighbor, and not suffer sin on him.">Leviticus 19:17</a>, so does this to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-15.htm" title="One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>. This selection of all that was highest and most spiritual in the ethical teaching of the Law is one of the features of our Lord's method, for the most part insufficiently recognised. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-17.htm" title="It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.">John 8:17</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - This gives the second step or stage in discipline. <span class="cmt_word">Take with thee one or two more.</span> If the offender is obdurate to secret remonstrance, do not yet resort to public measures, but make a fresh effort accompanied by a friend or two, who will support your view and confirm your expostulation, which might otherwise be considered partial or self-interested. <span class="cmt_word">In the mouth of two or three witnesses.</span> The idea is derived from the requirement of the Jewish Law in a case of litigation (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-17.htm">John 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>). By the testimony of these witnesses, <span class="cmt_word">every</span> <span class="cmt_word">word</span> that has passed between you may be fully certified. There will be forthcoming, if necessary, the regular legal evidence, should the matter come to other ears. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:15-20 If a professed Christian is wronged by another, he ought not to complain of it to others, as is often done merely upon report, but to go to the offender privately, state the matter kindly, and show him his conduct. This would generally have all the desired effect with a true Christian, and the parties would be reconciled. The principles of these rules may be practised every where, and under all circumstances, though they are too much neglected by all. But how few try the method which Christ has expressly enjoined to all his disciples! In all our proceedings we should seek direction in prayer; we cannot too highly prize the promises of God. Wherever and whenever we meet in the name of Christ, we should consider him as present in the midst of us.</body></html>
