The child was still there, perhaps still folded in the arms of Jesus, still the object of His care, even while He spake of the wider offences that "must needs come" upon the world at large. Looking to the frequency with which our Lord's words were addressed to the thoughts of His hearers, it seems likely that the faces of some at least of the disciples betrayed, as they looked on the child, some touch of half-contemptuous wonder, that called for this prompt rebuke. The words have, however, as interpreted by what follows, a wider range, and include among the "little ones," the child-like as well as children--all, indeed, whom Christ came to save.<p><span class= "bld">In heaven their angels.</span>--The words distinctly recognise the belief in guardian angels, entrusted each with a definite and special work. That guardianship is asserted in general terms in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-7.htm" title="The angel of the LORD encamps round about them that fear him, and delivers them.">Psalm 34:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-11.htm" title="For he shall give his angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways.">Psalm 91:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-14.htm" title="Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?">Hebrews 1:14</a>, and elsewhere. What is added to the general fact here is, that those who have the guardianship of the little ones assigned to them are among the most noble of the heavenly host, and are as the angels of the Presence, who, like Gabriel, stand before the face of God, and rejoice in the beatific vision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-19.htm" title="And the angel answering said to him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak to you, and to show you these glad tidings.">Luke 1:19</a>). The words "I say unto you" clothe what follows with the character of a new truth, as they do the like utterances of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-7.htm" title="I say to you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repents, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.">Luke 15:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-10.htm" title="Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repents.">Luke 15:10</a>. Whatever difficulties may connect themselves with the whole range of questions connected with the ministry of angels, they lie outside the work of the interpreter. There can be no question that our Lord adopts as His own the belief in the reality of that ministry, and this at a time when the Sadducees, as a leading sect, were calling it in question (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-8.htm" title="For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.">Acts 23:8</a>). The words are indirectly important as a witness to the fact that the Lord Jesus, while He proclaimed the universal Fatherhood of God as it had never been proclaimed before, also (almost, as it were, unconsciously, and when the assertion of the claim was not in view) claims a sonship nearer and higher than could have been claimed by any child of man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - From this verse to the end of the chapter we find no parallel in the other evangelists. The Saviour here returns to the subject of children, whether literally or metaphorically so called, and proclaims the high appreciation which is their due. <span class="cmt_word">Take</span> <span class="cmt_word">heed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">see</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>that ye despise not one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of these little ones.</span> God's care is minute; it extends to each individual of the class. The contempt denounced might arise in various ways and from various considerations. The advanced believer might despise children as hot competent to enter into covenant with God or fit to receive Church privileges, whereas circumcision under the old dispensation and infant baptism under the gospel afford a very different view. Again, to say or do unseemly things in the presence of children is a mode of" despising" which may prove a deadly offence. Or the contempt may be on the side of the ambitious and self-seeking, who cannot understand the simple and childlike spirit which seeketh not its own. The Lord gives two proofs of the high consideration due to his little ones. The first proof is that which follows; the second is given in vers. 11-14. <span class="cmt_word">Their angels.</span> Not "their spirits after death," as some commentators erroneously interpret (for the term "angel" is not so used, and Christ speaks in the present tense, <span class="cmt_word">do always behold</span>), but the angels especially appointed to watch and protect them - their guardian angels. This doctrine (which, as of very solemn import, the Lord introduces with his usual formula, <span class="cmt_word">I say unto you</span>), that each soul has assigned to it by God a special angel is grounded on this, and supported by many other passages of Scripture (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-7.htm">Luke 15:7, 10</a>). It has been questioned how angels can be said to succour us on earth, while <span class="cmt_word">in heaven</span> they are always looking on the face of the Father. The difficulty has been answered, among others, by St. Gregory, who writes, "They never so go forth apart from the vision of God, as to be deprived of the joys of interior contemplation. They are both sent from him, and stand by him too, since both in that they are circumscribed, they go forth, and in this that they are also entirely present, they never go away. Thus they at the same time always behold the Father's face, and yet come to us; because they both go forth to us in a spiritual presence, and yet keep themselves there, whence they had gone out, by virtue of interior contemplation" ('Moral.,' 2:3). It is probable that the highest order of angels is here signified, such as among the Jews was called, "the angels of the presence, or of the face." To behold the king's face means, in Eastern parlance, to be admitted to his immediate presence - to enjoy his special favour and confidence (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-19.htm">2 Kings 25:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-14.htm">Esther 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-25.htm">Jeremiah 52:25</a>). It is to these supreme beings, who draw their knowledge and love directly from Almighty God, and receive their commands from his mouth, that the tender lambs of Christ's flock are committed. This fact demonstrates their dignity and the great heinousness of setting a stumbling block in their way. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:7-14 Considering the cunning and malice of Satan, and the weakness and depravity of men's hearts, it is not possible but that there should be offences. God permits them for wise and holy ends, that those who are sincere, and those who are not, may be made known. Being told before, that there will be seducers, tempters, persecutors, and bad examples, let us stand on our guard. We must, as far as lawfully we may, part with what we cannot keep without being entangled by it in sin. The outward occasions of sin must be avoided. If we live after the flesh, we must die. If we, through the Spirit, mortify the deeds of the body, we shall live. Christ came into the world to save souls, and he will reckon severely with those who hinder the progress of others who are setting their faces heavenward. And shall any of us refuse attention to those whom the Son of God came to seek and to save? A father takes care of all his children, but is particularly tender of the little ones.</body></html>
