The punishment was not recognised in the Jewish law, but it was in occasional use among the Greeks (Diod. Sic. xvi. 35), and had been inflicted by Augustus (Sueton. <span class= "ital">Aug.</span> lxvii.) in cases of special infamy. Jerome states (in a note on this passage) that it was practised in Galilee, and it is not improbable that the Romans had inflicted it upon some of the ringleaders of the insurrection headed by Judas of Galilee. Our Lord's words, on this assumption, would come home with a special vividness to the minds of those who heard them. The infamy of offending one of the "little ones" was as great as that of those whoso crimes brought upon them this exceptional punishment. It was obviously a form of death less cruel in itself than many others, and its chief horror, both for Jews and heathen, was, probably, that it deprived the dead of all rites of burial. St. Mark and St. Luke, it may be noted, insert here the complaint of St. John, that he had seen one casting out devils in the name of Jesus, and this must be taken into account as an element in the sequence of thought. He was unconsciously placing himself among those who were hindering the work of Christ, and so "offending" those who believed in him. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-38.htm" title="And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in your name, and he follows not us: and we forbade him, because he follows not us.">Mark 9:38</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - There is an opposite side to this picture. <span class="cmt_word">Shall offend;</span> <span class="accented">cause to stumble</span> - give occasion for a fall, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. either in faith or morals. This is done by evil example, by teaching to sin, by sneers at piety, by giving soft names to gross offences. <span class="cmt_word">One of these little ones.</span> Whether child or adult, a pure, simple soul, which has a certain faith it be not strong enough to resist all attack. Even the heathen recognized the respect due to the young: "Maxima debetur puero reverentia" (Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 14:47); and guilelessness and purity, wherever found, win some regard, even from worthless and careless observers. To wilfully lead one such astray is a deadly sin, which the Lord denounces in solemn terms. Christ affectionately calls his disciples "little ones" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-42.htm">Matthew 10:42</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Believe in</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">me</span>. We must always distinguish between "believe in" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">or</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">credo in</span>) and "believe" with the simple dative; the former is applied to faith in God alone. Says St. Augustine, "Credimus Paulo, sed non credimus in Paulum." In the present passage the phrase implies the Divinity of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">It were better;</span> literally, <span class="accented">it is profitable</span>. The crime specified is so heinous that a man had better incur the most certain death, if by this means he may avoid the sin and save the soul of his possible victim. <span class="cmt_word">A millstone;</span> <span class="accented">a great millstone</span> - such a one as required an ass to inure. The upper, or movable, stone is meant, which was usually turned by the hand. <span class="cmt_word">Drowned</span>. We do not know that the Jews punished criminals by drowning (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>), though it is probable that it was practised in some cases; but by other nations this penalty was commonly exacted. Among the Romans, Greeks, and Syrians, it was certainly the practice. Commentators quote Suetonius, 'Aug.,' 67; Diod. Sic., 16:35; Livy, 1:51; Aristophanes, 'Schol. ad Equit.,' 1360. The punishment seems to have been reserved for the greatest criminals; and the size of the stone would prevent any chance of the body rising again to the surface and being buried by friends - a consideration which, in the minds of heathens, greatly increased the horror of this kind of death. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-6 Christ spoke many words of his sufferings, but only one of his glory; yet the disciples fasten upon that, and overlook the others. Many love to hear and speak of privileges and glory, who are willing to pass by the thoughts of work and trouble. Our Lord set a little child before them, solemnly assuring them, that unless they were converted and made like little children, they could not enter his kingdom. Children, when very young, do not desire authority, do not regard outward distinctions, are free from malice, are teachable, and willingly dependent on their parents. It is true that they soon begin to show other dispositions, and other ideas are taught them at an early age; but these are marks of childhood, and render them proper emblems of the lowly minds of true Christians. Surely we need to be daily renewed in the spirit of our minds, that we may become simple and humble, as little children, and willing to be the least of all. Let us daily study this subject, and examine our own spirits.</body></html>
