There the growth was outward, measured by the extension of the Church, dependent on its missionary efforts. Here the working is from within. The "leaven"--commonly, as in the Passover ritual, the symbol of malice and wickedness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-8.htm" title="Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.">1Corinthians 5:8</a>)--causing an action in the flour with which it is mingled that is of the nature of decay and tends to actual putrescence, here becomes, in the mode of teaching which does not confine itself within the limits of a traditional and conventional symbolism, the type of influence for good as well as evil. It can turn the flour into human food--this symbolism is traceable in the leavened loaves that were offered on the day of Pentecost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-17.htm" title="You shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baked with leaven; they are the first fruits to the LORD.">Leviticus 23:17</a>)--can permeate the manners, feelings, and opinions of non-Christian societies until they become blessings and not curses to mankind. In the new feelings, gradually diffused, of Christendom as to slavery, prostitution, gladiatorial games--in the new reverence for childhood and womanhood, for poverty and sickness--we may trace the working of the leaven.<p>Descending to the details of the parable, it is at least open to us (as an application of it, if not as an interpretation) to see in the woman, as in the parable of the Lost Piece of Money (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-8.htm" title="Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, does not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it?">Luke 15:8</a>), the representative of the divine Wisdom as working in the history of the world, or of the Church of Christ as embodying that wisdom. The <span class= "ital">three</span> measures of meal admit, in like manner, of many references, of which we cannot say with certainty that one is more likely to have been intended than another. The descendants of the three sons of Noah, or the Jew, the Greek, the Barbarian, as representing the whole race of mankind, or body, soul, and spirit, as the three parts of man's nature, which the new truth is to permeate and purify, are all in this sense equally legitimate applications.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="accented">The parable of the leaven.</span> Parallel passage: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-20.htm">Luke 13:20, 21</a>. The growth of the kingdom regarded in its quiet and secret influence. This is to be ultimately complete and universal. The prophecy is partially fulfilled with every fresh recognition of Christian principles in public opinion, or customs, or laws. For "every thought" shall be brought "captive unto the obedience of Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-5.htm">2 Corinthians 10:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven.</span> This is the only passage where leaven is spoken of with reference to its permeating qualities alone, without any trace of the notion of defilement, which the Paschal and other regulations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-15.htm">Exodus 23:15, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-11.htm">Leviticus 2:11</a>) so readily suggested. Even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-9.htm">Galatians 5:9</a> this connotation of evil is not altogether absent. In Talm. Bab., 'Berach.,' 17<span class="accented">a</span>, it is used as a figure of the "evil impulse" within us. Hence some have interpreted it in a similar sense here, and have understood our Lord to be referring to the spread of worldliness in the Church (especially after the conversion of Constantine); but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> this is opposed to the <span class="accented">prima facie</span> meaning; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is unreasonable to insist that a symbol must always have the same connotation; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> it is opposed to the idea of deliberate purpose underlying the action of the woman; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the closing words would cast too awful a shadow - they would mean that Christianity fails. <span class="cmt_word">Which a woman took</span> (ver. 31, note), <span class="cmt_word">and hid</span>. The woman probably belongs entirely to the framework of the parable (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4, 8</a>). For the work described is always, in normal societies, performed by women. Of other interpretations that which sees in her the Church as the agent by whom the kingdom of God is wrought into the world is the best. <span class="cmt_word">In three measures of meal;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> an ephah. This appears to have been a convenient quantity (about a peck) for kneading at one time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-6.htm">Genesis 18:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-19.htm">Judges 6:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Until the whole was leavened;</span> literally, <span class="accented">until it was leavened, even the whole of it</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). While our Lord thus promises that the permeating influence of the kingdom of heaven shall at last be entirely successful, it is unfair to so press the parable as to deduce from it that the world as such will continue to be gradually and continuously improved up to the Lord's return. It may be so (contrast, however, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-8.htm">Luke 18:8</a>), but even direct prophecy, and still more parable, frequently regards the ultimate result, and passes over the intermediate stages. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:31-35 The scope of the parable of the seed sown, is to show that the beginnings of the gospel would be small, but its latter end would greatly increase; in this way the work of grace in the heart, the kingdom of God within us, would be carried on. In the soul where grace truly is, it will grow really; though perhaps at first not to be discerned, it will at last come to great strength and usefulness. The preaching of the gospel works like leaven in the hearts of those who receive it. The leaven works certainly, so does the word, yet gradually. It works silently, and without being seen, Mr 4:26-29, yet strongly; without noise, for so is the way of the Spirit, but without fail. Thus it was in the world. The apostles, by preaching the gospel, hid a handful of leaven in the great mass of mankind. It was made powerful by the Spirit of the Lord of hosts, who works, and none can hinder. Thus it is in the heart. When the gospel comes into the soul, it works a thorough change; it spreads itself into all the powers and faculties of the soul, and alters the property even of the members of the body, Ro 6:13. From these parables we are taught to expect a gradual progress; therefore let us inquire, Are we growing in grace? and in holy principles and habits?</body></html>
