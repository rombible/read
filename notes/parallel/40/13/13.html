In St. Mark and St. Luke the reason given assumes a penal character, "that seeing they might not see;" as though they were not only to be left in their ignorance, but to be plunged deeper in it. And this, it is obvious, is even here the true meaning, for only thus does this clause answer to the conclusion of the proverb of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-12.htm" title="For whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whoever has not, from him shall be taken away even that he has.">Matthew 13:12</a>, "From him shall be taken away even that which he hath." In one aspect, then, the parable was a veil hiding the truth from them, because they did not seek the truth, and this was the working of the divine law of retribution. But even here we may venture to trace beneath the penalty an element of mercy. The parable could, at all events, do men no harm. It could not rouse the fierce enmity that had been kindled by truth spoken in its plainness. And it might prepare the way, might set men thinking and questioning, and if so, that was at least one step towards the "having," though it were but a very little, which might place them among those to whom more shall be given.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). To carry out the principle of the whole preceding verse, but with special reference to the second half of it. Because, in this case, they "have not," <span class="accented">therefore</span> I speak to them thus. <span class="cmt_word">Speak I to them in parables because.</span> In the parallel passages Christ says that he speaks in parables "<span class="accented">in order that</span> seeing," etc.; but here, "<span class="accented">because</span> seeing," etc. The difference of the thought, which is more formal than real, is that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in the parallel passages their moral blindness and deafness are represented as the <span class="accented">effect</span> of what he says, parables being used <span class="accented">to bring about</span> the punishment for what was presumably earlier sloth (thus laying stress on the idea of "shall be taken away "in our ver. 12; cf. "that they which see not may be made blind," <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39</a>; and Bishop Westcott's note). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> In Matthew their present moral blindness and deafness are represented as the <span class="accented">reason</span> for the use of parables. Parables are themselves the punishment; the people are fit for nothing else (thus laying stress on the "has not" of ver. 12); therefore Christ speaks to them in parables. <span class="cmt_word">They seeing see not</span> (<span class="accented">seeing they see not</span>, Revised Version, keeping the order of the Greek, as even the Authorized Version in the next clause); <span class="cmt_word">and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand</span>. The participles "seeing," "hearing," in Matthew and Luke, probably do <span class="accented">not</span> represent the Hebrew infinitive in its common usage of giving intensity or continuance to the idea of the finite verb to which it is joined (so in the original passage of Isaiah, and perhaps in Mark; compare also "seeing" in the next verse), but are to be taken separately, <span class="accented">i.e."</span> Though they have powers of seeing and of hearing, they nevertheless do not so use these powers as to see and hear" (for the thought, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-21.htm">Jeremiah 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-2.htm">Ezekiel 12:2</a>). Thus in meaning, though not in form, as compared with the next verse, <span class="accented">seeing</span> is equivalent to "seeing ye shall see;" <span class="accented">they see not</span>, to "and shall in no wise perceive;" <span class="accented">hearing</span>, to "hearing ye shall hear;" <span class="accented">they hear not</span>, to "and shall in no wise understand." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-23 Jesus entered into a boat that he might be the less pressed, and be the better heard by the people. By this he teaches us in the outward circumstances of worship not to covet that which is stately, but to make the best of the conveniences God in his providence allots to us. Christ taught in parables. Thereby the things of God were made more plain and easy to those willing to be taught, and at the same time more difficult and obscure to those who were willingly ignorant. The parable of the sower is plain. The seed sown is the word of God. The sower is our Lord Jesus Christ, by himself, or by his ministers. Preaching to a multitude is sowing the corn; we know not where it will light. Some sort of ground, though we take ever so much pains with it, brings forth no fruit to purpose, while the good soil brings forth plentifully. So it is with the hearts of men, whose different characters are here described by four sorts of ground. Careless, trifling hearers, are an easy prey to Satan; who, as he is the great murderer of souls, so he is the great thief of sermons, and will be sure to rob us of the word, if we take not care to keep it. Hypocrites, like the stony ground, often get the start of true Christians in the shows of profession. Many are glad to hear a good sermon, who do not profit by it. They are told of free salvation, of the believer's privileges, and the happiness of heaven; and, without any change of heart, without any abiding conviction of their own depravity, their need of a Saviour, or the excellence of holiness, they soon profess an unwarranted assurance. But when some heavy trial threatens them, or some sinful advantage may be had, they give up or disguise their profession, or turn to some easier system. Worldly cares are fitly compared to thorns, for they came in with sin, and are a fruit of the curse; they are good in their place to stop a gap, but a man must be well armed that has much to do with them; they are entangling, vexing, scratching, and their end is to be burned, Heb 6:8. Worldly cares are great hinderances to our profiting by the word of God. The deceitfulness of riches does the mischief; they cannot be said to deceive us unless we put our trust in them, then they choke the good seed. What distinguished the good ground was fruitfulness. By this true Christians are distinguished from hypocrites. Christ does not say that this good ground has no stones in it, or no thorns; but none that could hinder its fruitfulness. All are not alike; we should aim at the highest, to bring forth most fruit. The sense of hearing cannot be better employed than in hearing God's word; and let us look to ourselves that we may know what sort of hearers we are.</body></html>
