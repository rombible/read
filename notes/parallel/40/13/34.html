The same general idea underlies our present verses, but although each evangelist appears to have used the same words as a basis, he has worked them out in his own characteristic way. For while both writers contrast our Lord's treatment of the multitudes and his treatment of the disciples in the matter of parables, St. Mark barely alludes to his using them as a judicial punishment upon the people, and St. Matthew merely hints here at the fact that Christ explained them to his disciples (see further, ver. 35<span class="accented">b</span>, note). It will be noticed that our verses have much in common with the thought of ver. 10, <span class="accented">sqq.</span> It seems just possible that both paragraphs had one common nucleus from which they were each developed. But according to existing evidence, ver. 10, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>, and the parallel passages in Mark and Luke serve to introduce explanatory matter to the disciples, and our present verses with the parallel in Mark to close a series of parables. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All these things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>)<span class="accented">. All</span> seems to imply that the four preceding parables are but a few typical ones taken from a larger collection (cf. Mark, "with many such parables;" also vers. 3, 51). <span class="cmt_word">Spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables;</span> <span class="accented">in parables unto the multitudes</span> (Revised Version); for the order of the Greek is the same as in the next clause. Observe the "parallelism" of the two clauses (contrast Mark). Is it due to the influence of Hebrew Christians? <span class="cmt_word">And without a parable spake he not</span> (<span class="accented">nothing</span>, Revised Version, ebony) unto them, As happens often in Semitic writers (cf. St. John's Gospel), the thought of the preceding clause is now expressed negatively, and yet a fresh thought is added, namely, that he spake in parables alone. <span class="accented">Nothing</span> (Revised Version); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> under these circumstances, when large crowds of Galilaeans were listening to him. <span class="accented">Spake</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>: contrast <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> before); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> during this period. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:31-35 The scope of the parable of the seed sown, is to show that the beginnings of the gospel would be small, but its latter end would greatly increase; in this way the work of grace in the heart, the kingdom of God within us, would be carried on. In the soul where grace truly is, it will grow really; though perhaps at first not to be discerned, it will at last come to great strength and usefulness. The preaching of the gospel works like leaven in the hearts of those who receive it. The leaven works certainly, so does the word, yet gradually. It works silently, and without being seen, Mr 4:26-29, yet strongly; without noise, for so is the way of the Spirit, but without fail. Thus it was in the world. The apostles, by preaching the gospel, hid a handful of leaven in the great mass of mankind. It was made powerful by the Spirit of the Lord of hosts, who works, and none can hinder. Thus it is in the heart. When the gospel comes into the soul, it works a thorough change; it spreads itself into all the powers and faculties of the soul, and alters the property even of the members of the body, Ro 6:13. From these parables we are taught to expect a gradual progress; therefore let us inquire, Are we growing in grace? and in holy principles and habits?</body></html>
