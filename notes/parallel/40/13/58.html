Notice there, "He could not do... and he marvelled because of their unbelief." Our Lord was hindered, not by lack of power, but by lack of those moral conditions which would alone have made his miracles really tend to the spiritual advantage of the inhabitants of Nazareth (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-38.htm">Matthew 12:38</a>). <span class="accented">Because of their unbelief</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> complete (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>); but in the case of the failure of the disciples to perform a miracle, only comparative (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:53-58 Christ repeats his offer to those who have repulsed them. They upbraid him, Is not this the carpenter's son? Yes, it is true he was reputed to be so; and no disgrace to be the son of an honest tradesman; they should have respected him the more because he was one of themselves, but therefore they despised him. He did not many mighty works there, because of their unbelief. Unbelief is the great hinderance to Christ's favours. Let us keep faithful to him as the Saviour who has made our peace with God.</body></html>
