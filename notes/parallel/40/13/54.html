On this assumption, the narrative must be misplaced in its relation to other facts in one or other of the Gospels. A dislocation of some kind must indeed be admitted in any case, as St. Mark places it after the resurrection of Jairus's daughter, and makes that event follow the cure of the Gadarene demoniac, and places that on the next day after the first use of parables. We are compelled to admit, as before in the Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-1.htm" title="When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.">Matthew 8:1</a>, the almost entire absence of any trustworthy notes of chronological sequence, beyond the grouping, in some cases, of a few conspicuous facts. In comparing, however, St. Matthew and St. Mark with St. Luke, there seems no sufficient ground for hastily assuming identity. The third Gospel places the visit which it narrates, at the very beginning of our Lord's work, and as giving the reason of His removal to Capernaum. Here, there is no outburst of violent enmity such as we find there, but simple amazement. It seems, therefore, more probable that we have here a short account (short and imperfect, it may be, because our Lord went without His disciples) of another effort to bring the men of Nazareth to acknowledge Him, if not as the Christ, at least as a Prophet. The circumstances of the case in St. Matthew's record suggest another motive as, at least, possible. He had recently, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-48.htm" title="But he answered and said to him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brothers?">Matthew 12:48</a>, when His mother and His brethren had come in their eager anxiety to interrupt His work, spoken in words that seemed to repel them to a distance from Him. What if this visit were meant to show that, though as a Prophet He could not brook that interruption, home affections were not dead in Him, that His heart still yearned over His brethren and His townsmen, and that He sought to raise them to a higher life? On comparing the account here with that in St. Luke, it would seem almost certain that there was now a less direct assertion of His claims as the Christ than there had been before--a proclamation of the laws of the kingdom rather than of His own position in it. And so the impression is one of wonder at His wisdom, not of anger or scorn at what He claims to be.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 54-58.</span> - Unbelief manifested in Jesus' own country, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Nazareth. Parallel passage: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-1.htm">Mark 6:1-6</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-30</a> we have also an account of a scene at Nazareth; but the occasion was almost certainly a different one from that described here. His account, however, seems to have been modified in form from the better known narrative found in the Framework, and used in Matthew and Mark. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 54.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when</span> <span class="cmt_word">he was come into his own country</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Nazareth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-23.htm">Luke 4:23</a> the phrase is used with express contrast to Capernaum. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-44.htm">John 4:44</a> it is, as it seems, used in a special sense of Judaea, even though it comes in a saying that is almost identical with our ver. 57 (see Bishop Westcott). <span class="cmt_word">He taught them in their synagogue.</span> His teaching appears to have spread over at least a few days (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Insomuch</span> <span class="cmt_word">that they were astonished</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28, 29</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and said, Whence</span> (<span class="greek_word">po/qen</span>). And <span class="cmt_word">so</span> again in ver. 56. The sentence might in itself express an earnest desire to know the origin of our Lord. But the fact that they were "offended in him" (ver. 57) shows that their language was due. not so much to inquiry as to astonishment, which may in some cases be the first stage of inquiry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-33.htm">Matthew 9:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-23.htm">Matthew 12:23</a>), or may, as here, be checked from further development. Knowing his family, and despising it, they treated him merely as a curiosity, and never thought of submitting themselves to him. <span class="cmt_word">Hath this Man this wisdom.</span> Which they had just heard. <span class="cmt_word">And these mighty works?</span> <span class="accented">These</span> is not expressed in the Greek, nor necessarily implied. Perhaps he had already performed some of the few miracles that he wrought there (ver. 58), or possibly his townsfolk referred to what they had heard of his miracles elsewhere. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:53-58 Christ repeats his offer to those who have repulsed them. They upbraid him, Is not this the carpenter's son? Yes, it is true he was reputed to be so; and no disgrace to be the son of an honest tradesman; they should have respected him the more because he was one of themselves, but therefore they despised him. He did not many mighty works there, because of their unbelief. Unbelief is the great hinderance to Christ's favours. Let us keep faithful to him as the Saviour who has made our peace with God.</body></html>
