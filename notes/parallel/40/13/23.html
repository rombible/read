He takes it in, discerns its meaning. The phrases in the other Gospels express the same thing, "hear the word and receive it<span class= "ital">"</span> (Mark), "in an honest and good heart" hear and retain it (Luke). Even here, however, there are different degrees of the holiness which is symbolised by "bearing fruit"--"some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty"--varying according to men's capacities and opportunities.<p>It is allowable to fill up the outline-sketch of interpretation which thus formed the first lesson in this method in the great Master's school. (1.) It may seem strange at first that the disciples were not told who in the work of the kingdom answered to "the Sower" of the parable. The interpretation is given in the parable of the Tares ("the Sower of the good seed is the Son of Man"), and, in part, it may be said that this was the one point on which the disciples were not likely to misunderstand Him; but in part also, we may believe, this explanation was not given, because, though the parable was true in the first instance of Him and of His work, He meant them to learn wisdom from it for their own work. True, they were reaping what they had not sown (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-38.htm" title="I sent you to reap that where on you bestowed no labor: other men labored, and you are entered into their labors.">John 4:38</a>), yet they too were in their turn to be sowers as well as reapers. (2.) It is obviously one important lesson of the parable that it teaches us to recognise the possible existence of "an honest and good heart" (the first word meaning "noble," "generous," rather than "honest" in our modern sense) prior to the preaching of the word. Such characters were to be found in those living under the Law, or without the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-14.htm" title="For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law to themselves:">Romans 2:14</a>), and it was the work of the preacher to look out for them, and win them to something yet higher. What made the ground good, is a question which the parable was perhaps meant to suggest, but does not answer. Theologians may speak of "prevenient grace." The language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/4-37.htm" title="And herein is that saying true, One sows, and another reaps.">John 4:37-38</a> leads us to think of the work of "the Light that lighteth every man." Here also the law holds good that "to him that hath shall more be given." (3.) It lies in the nature of such a parable that it represents the phenomena of the spiritual life only partially. It brings before us four classes of hearers, and seems to assume that their characters are fixed, incapable of change, issuing in results which might have been foreseen. But if so, then the work of the "word" thus preached would seem to be limited to order and progress, and the idea of "conversion"--the change of character--would almost be excluded. We must therefore supplement the parable in its practical application. The soil may be improved; the way-side and the stony places and that which contained the thorns may become as the good ground. It is the work of every preacher and teacher to prepare the soil as well as to sow the seed. In the words of an old prophet, which might almost seem to have suggested the parable itself, they are to "break up the fallow ground and sow not among thorns" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-3.htm" title="For thus said the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.">Jeremiah 4:3</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which also;</span> <span class="accented">who verily</span> (Revised Version, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;</span>), the particle giving exactness, to the relative (see Dr. Moulton's note at the end of Winer, &sect; 53). <span class="cmt_word">Some;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> (Westcott and Hort).

"100 longius absunt a 60, quam 60 a 30. Habenti dabitur" (Bengel). The reason of the difference in the produce of the good ground is not stated, but, according to the tenor of the whole passage since ver. 3. this lay in a difference already existing within this good ground. Into the question of the <span class="accented">ultimate</span> cause of some men being in a better state of preparedness to receive Divine truths than others, our Lord does not enter. Prevenient grace is not always to be insisted upon in practical exhortation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-23 Jesus entered into a boat that he might be the less pressed, and be the better heard by the people. By this he teaches us in the outward circumstances of worship not to covet that which is stately, but to make the best of the conveniences God in his providence allots to us. Christ taught in parables. Thereby the things of God were made more plain and easy to those willing to be taught, and at the same time more difficult and obscure to those who were willingly ignorant. The parable of the sower is plain. The seed sown is the word of God. The sower is our Lord Jesus Christ, by himself, or by his ministers. Preaching to a multitude is sowing the corn; we know not where it will light. Some sort of ground, though we take ever so much pains with it, brings forth no fruit to purpose, while the good soil brings forth plentifully. So it is with the hearts of men, whose different characters are here described by four sorts of ground. Careless, trifling hearers, are an easy prey to Satan; who, as he is the great murderer of souls, so he is the great thief of sermons, and will be sure to rob us of the word, if we take not care to keep it. Hypocrites, like the stony ground, often get the start of true Christians in the shows of profession. Many are glad to hear a good sermon, who do not profit by it. They are told of free salvation, of the believer's privileges, and the happiness of heaven; and, without any change of heart, without any abiding conviction of their own depravity, their need of a Saviour, or the excellence of holiness, they soon profess an unwarranted assurance. But when some heavy trial threatens them, or some sinful advantage may be had, they give up or disguise their profession, or turn to some easier system. Worldly cares are fitly compared to thorns, for they came in with sin, and are a fruit of the curse; they are good in their place to stop a gap, but a man must be well armed that has much to do with them; they are entangling, vexing, scratching, and their end is to be burned, Heb 6:8. Worldly cares are great hinderances to our profiting by the word of God. The deceitfulness of riches does the mischief; they cannot be said to deceive us unless we put our trust in them, then they choke the good seed. What distinguished the good ground was fruitfulness. By this true Christians are distinguished from hypocrites. Christ does not say that this good ground has no stones in it, or no thorns; but none that could hinder its fruitfulness. All are not alike; we should aim at the highest, to bring forth most fruit. The sense of hearing cannot be better employed than in hearing God's word; and let us look to ourselves that we may know what sort of hearers we are.</body></html>
