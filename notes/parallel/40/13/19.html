Our interest in it may, perhaps, be quickened if we think of it as reflecting what had actually been our Lord's experience. The classes of hearers who had gathered round Him were represented, roughly and generally, by the four issues of the seed scattered by the sower, and all preachers of the truth, from that day to this, have felt that their own experience has presented analogous phenomena.<p>The ethical sequence described runs thus: The man hears "the word of the kingdom," a discourse, say, like the Sermon on the Mount, or that at Nazareth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/4-16.htm" title="And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.">Luke 4:16-21</a>). He does not "understand" it (the fault being moral rather than intellectual), does not attend to it or "take it in." The "wicked one" (note the connection with the clause in the Lord's Prayer, "Deliver us from evil," or <span class= "ital">the evil one</span>) snatches it away even from his memory. At first it seems strange that "the birds of the air" in their multitude should represent the Tempter in his unity; and yet there is a terrible truth in the fact that everything which leads men to forget the truth is, in very deed, doing the work of the great enemy. On the other hand, the birds, in their rapid flight and their gathering flocks, may well represent the light and foolish thoughts that are as the Tempter's instruments. The "way-side" thus answers to the character, which is hardened by the wear and tear of daily life, what we well call its routine, so that the words of Truth make hardly even the most transient impression on it.<p><span class= "bld">This is he which received seed.</span>--Our translators try, unsuccessfully, to combine the parable with its interpretation. Literally, and far better, here and in the following verses, <span class= "ital">this man it is that is</span> (the seed) <span class= "ital">sown by the way side.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not.</span> <span class="accented">Understandeth.</span> The form of the explanation here is influenced by the language of vers. 14, 15. <span class="cmt_word">Then</span> (not in the Greek) <span class="cmt_word">cometh the wicked one;</span> <span class="accented">the evil one</span> (Revised Version); <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">And catcheth</span> (<span class="accented">snatcheth</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">away</span> - seizeth for himself (<span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-12.htm">Matthew 11:12</a>, note) - <span class="cmt_word">that which was sown in his heart. This is he which</span> <span class="cmt_word">received seed.</span> <span class="accented">That was sown</span> (Revised Version, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>). And so throughout. The masculine is not merely concise, but also expresses the fact that, as even with land, the man who receives the seed does not put forth in turn merely the seed as something alien, but rather himself so far as he is influenced by the seed; or (regarding the subject from another point of view) he puts forth the new life and energy of the seed as conditioned by that which makes up himself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-23 Jesus entered into a boat that he might be the less pressed, and be the better heard by the people. By this he teaches us in the outward circumstances of worship not to covet that which is stately, but to make the best of the conveniences God in his providence allots to us. Christ taught in parables. Thereby the things of God were made more plain and easy to those willing to be taught, and at the same time more difficult and obscure to those who were willingly ignorant. The parable of the sower is plain. The seed sown is the word of God. The sower is our Lord Jesus Christ, by himself, or by his ministers. Preaching to a multitude is sowing the corn; we know not where it will light. Some sort of ground, though we take ever so much pains with it, brings forth no fruit to purpose, while the good soil brings forth plentifully. So it is with the hearts of men, whose different characters are here described by four sorts of ground. Careless, trifling hearers, are an easy prey to Satan; who, as he is the great murderer of souls, so he is the great thief of sermons, and will be sure to rob us of the word, if we take not care to keep it. Hypocrites, like the stony ground, often get the start of true Christians in the shows of profession. Many are glad to hear a good sermon, who do not profit by it. They are told of free salvation, of the believer's privileges, and the happiness of heaven; and, without any change of heart, without any abiding conviction of their own depravity, their need of a Saviour, or the excellence of holiness, they soon profess an unwarranted assurance. But when some heavy trial threatens them, or some sinful advantage may be had, they give up or disguise their profession, or turn to some easier system. Worldly cares are fitly compared to thorns, for they came in with sin, and are a fruit of the curse; they are good in their place to stop a gap, but a man must be well armed that has much to do with them; they are entangling, vexing, scratching, and their end is to be burned, Heb 6:8. Worldly cares are great hinderances to our profiting by the word of God. The deceitfulness of riches does the mischief; they cannot be said to deceive us unless we put our trust in them, then they choke the good seed. What distinguished the good ground was fruitfulness. By this true Christians are distinguished from hypocrites. Christ does not say that this good ground has no stones in it, or no thorns; but none that could hinder its fruitfulness. All are not alike; we should aim at the highest, to bring forth most fruit. The sense of hearing cannot be better employed than in hearing God's word; and let us look to ourselves that we may know what sort of hearers we are.</body></html>
