Observe that according to the thought of the parable, it is suggested that the likeness consists not only in the brightness of the sun in itself, but also in its being alone in the sky, with nothing round it to prevent its full glory being seen. <span class="accented">Then.</span> The chief lesson of the parable; not before, but at, that time. <span class="cmt_word">In the kingdom of their Father.</span> In ver. 38 they were spoken of as "the sons of the kingdom;" here <span class="accented">their Father</span> is expressly mentioned, not "the Son of man" (vers. 37, 41). The same reference to his Father rather than to himself is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-29.htm">Matthew 26:29</a>. Did our Lord wish already to hint that "then cometh the end, when he shall deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>)? Had St. Paul's teaching also here a direct connexion with that of our Lord (ver. 41, note)? <span class="cmt_word">Who hath ears to hear, let him hear</span> (ver. 9, note). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:31-35 The scope of the parable of the seed sown, is to show that the beginnings of the gospel would be small, but its latter end would greatly increase; in this way the work of grace in the heart, the kingdom of God within us, would be carried on. In the soul where grace truly is, it will grow really; though perhaps at first not to be discerned, it will at last come to great strength and usefulness. The preaching of the gospel works like leaven in the hearts of those who receive it. The leaven works certainly, so does the word, yet gradually. It works silently, and without being seen, Mr 4:26-29, yet strongly; without noise, for so is the way of the Spirit, but without fail. Thus it was in the world. The apostles, by preaching the gospel, hid a handful of leaven in the great mass of mankind. It was made powerful by the Spirit of the Lord of hosts, who works, and none can hinder. Thus it is in the heart. When the gospel comes into the soul, it works a thorough change; it spreads itself into all the powers and faculties of the soul, and alters the property even of the members of the body, Ro 6:13.
