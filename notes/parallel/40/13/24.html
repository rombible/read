Then, again addressing Himself to the multitude on the shore, He spake the parables of the Tares, the Mustard Seed, and the Leaven; then, dismissing the multitude (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-36.htm" title="Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came to him, saying, Declare to us the parable of the tares of the field.">Matthew 13:36</a>), He landed with His disciples, and went into the house which was for a time their home.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-30</span> - <span class="accented">The parable of the tares.</span> Matthew only. The parable of the sower dealt with the first reception of the gospel; this deals with the after-development. The aim of this parable is to prevent over-sanguine expectations as to the purity of the society of believers, and to hinder rash attempts to purify it by merely external processes. Archbishop Benson ('Dict. of Christian Biogr.,' 1:745) calls attention to the fact that the first extant exposition of this parable is in Cyprian's successful appeal to the Novatianists not to separate from the Church (Ep. 54.). The aim of the somewhat similar parable in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-26.htm">Mark 4:26-29</a> is to show the slowness and gradualness of the growth of the kingdom of heaven, and also the certainty of its consummation. So many words and phrases in the two parables are identical, that the possibility of one being derived from the other, either by omission or addition, must be acknowledged, but the definiteness of the aim in each points rather to their being originally two distinct parables. The divisions of the parable are - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The fact of tares being present as well as good seed, and its cause (vers. 24-28<span class="accented">a</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Although there is the natural desire to gather out the tares at once, yet, on account of the impossibility of doing so without destroying some of the good seed, this must not be attempted. At the proper time full separation shall be made by the proper agents (vers. 28<span class="accented">b</span>-30). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Another parable put he forth unto them;</span> <span class="accented">set he before them</span> (Revised Version, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>); so also ver. 31. (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-7.htm">Exodus 19:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-3.htm">Acts 17:3</a>).

Observe that the verb is transitional; in ver. 3 our Lord began his parable without any introduction, so that he might attract attention; here he says that he gives an illustration of the kingdom of heaven; but in the later parables of this discourse (vers. 31, 33, 44, 45, 47; cf. 52) he is able merely to say that the kingdom of heaven is, in its principles, etc., absolutely like (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">A man which sowed.</span> Explained as "the Son of man" in ver. 37. <span class="cmt_word">Good seed;</span> "the sons of the kingdom" (ver. 38); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the seed represents, not good or bad doctrine as such, but persons. <span class="cmt_word">In his field;</span> "the world" (ver. 37). Not exactly the Church, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Church upon earth, but the world so far as it is the sphere of the Church's missionary activity, even the physical world so far as it becomes the scene of Divine sowing of the gospel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:24-30, 36-43 This parable represents the present and future state of the gospel church; Christ's care of it, the devil's enmity against it, the mixture there is in it of good and bad in this world, and the separation between them in the other world. So prone is fallen man to sin, that if the enemy sow the tares, he may go his way, they will spring up, and do hurt; whereas, when good seed is sown, it must be tended, watered, and fenced. The servants complained to their master; Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? No doubt he did; whatever is amiss in the church, we are sure it is not from Christ. Though gross transgressors, and such as openly oppose the gospel, ought to be separated from the society of the faithful, yet no human skill can make an exact separation. Those who oppose must not be cut off, but instructed, and that with meekness. And though good and bad are together in this world, yet at the great day they shall be parted; then the righteous and the wicked shall be plainly known; here sometimes it is hard to distinguish between them. Let us, knowing the terrors of the Lord, not do iniquity. At death, believers shall shine forth to themselves; at the great day they shall shine forth before all the world. They shall shine by reflection, with light borrowed from the Fountain of light. Their sanctification will be made perfect, and their justification published. May we be found of that happy number.</body></html>
