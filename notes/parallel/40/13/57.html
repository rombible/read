The words in St. Mark include "among his kindred." The proverb seems to have been one often on our Lord's lips, and obviously tells of a prolonged experience of indifference and unbelief in all their many forms. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-44.htm" title="For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honor in his own country.">John 4:44</a>, it appears, in a context which presents some difficulty, as giving the reason why our Lord, on leaving Judaea, went into Galilee.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 57.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they were offended in him</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-29.htm">Matthew 5:29</a>, note). Their knowledge of the earthly conditions of his youth proved a stumbling block to their faith. But <span class="cmt_word">Jesus said unto them</span>. He accepts the fact, but reminds them that they were under a special temptation thus to reject him. Even in his reproof he will call them to rise above their position. <span class="cmt_word">A prophet is not without honour.</span> There will ever be some to honour him. He who speaks forth the mind of God shall not totally fail in any place save one. An encouragement and a warning. <span class="cmt_word">Save in his own country</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;</span>). Better omit <span class="accented">own</span>, for <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> is not genuine here (contrast Mark), and the insertion of <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> before <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;</span>, is not supported by enough authority. Mark adds, "and among his own kin." <span class="cmt_word">And in his own house.</span> Possibly Jeremiah's experience (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-21.htm">Jeremiah 11:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-6.htm">Jeremiah 12:6</a>) gave rise to this proverb. (On <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-44.htm">John 4:44</a>, cf. ver. 54, note.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:53-58 Christ repeats his offer to those who have repulsed them. They upbraid him, Is not this the carpenter's son? Yes, it is true he was reputed to be so; and no disgrace to be the son of an honest tradesman; they should have respected him the more because he was one of themselves, but therefore they despised him. He did not many mighty works there, because of their unbelief. Unbelief is the great hinderance to Christ's favours. Let us keep faithful to him as the Saviour who has made our peace with God.</body></html>
