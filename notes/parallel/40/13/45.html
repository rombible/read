The caprices of luxury in the Roman empire had given a prominence to pearls, as an article of commerce, which they had never had before, and have probably never had since. They, rather than emeralds and sapphires, were the typical instance of all costliest adornments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-6.htm" title="Give not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast you your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.">Matthew 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-9.htm" title="In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with modesty and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;">1Timothy 2:9</a>). The story of Cleopatra, the fact that the opening of a new pearl market was one of the alleged motives which led the Emperor Claudius to invade Britain, are indications of the value that was then set on the "goodly pearls" of the parable. Such a merchant seeking them, either on the shores of the Mediterranean, or as brought by <span class= "ital">caravans</span> to other traders from the Persian Gulf or the Indian Ocean, must have been a familiar presence to the fishermen of Capernaum. The parable in its spiritual bearing, has, of course, much that is common with the preceding. But there is this marked and suggestive difference. The "search" is presupposed, The man has been seeking the "goodly pearls" of wisdom, holiness, and truth, and has found them in at least some of their lower forms. Then he is led to the higher knowledge of communion with the life of Christ, and for that is content to resign all that he had before prized most highly. Such, in the records of the New Testament, was the history of St. Paul when he counted "all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-8.htm" title="Yes doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,">Philippians 3:8</a>). Such, in after days, was the history of Justin Martyr and Augustine. Such, in our own time, has been that of many noble and true-hearted seekers after truth and holiness. Such will evermore be the history of those who are faithful in a very little, and who, "willing to do the will of God, shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-17.htm" title="If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.">John 7:17</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 45, 46.</span> - <span class="accented">The parable of the pearl merchant</span>, Matthew only. Observe in this parable that the merchant is accustomed to deal in pearls, and is searching for good ones, when he meets with one worth more than the others he possesses all put together. If the former parable described one who finds the gospel as it were by chance (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> the woman of Samaria), this speaks of one who has long been searching for truth (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Andrew and John, the Ethiopian eunuch). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a</span> <span class="cmt_word">merchant man.</span> Evidently no poor man, but a rich wholesale dealer (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-23.htm">Revelation 18:23</a>; not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "a retailer;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Seeking</span>. According to the usual manner of his life. <span class="cmt_word">Goodly pearls.</span> He eared nothing about the inferior kinds or specimens. The man aimed high; he got more than he can have thought possible (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7, 8</a>). Origen (Commentary, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>; Huet, 1. p. 210) has much curious matter about the different kinds of pearls. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:44-52 Here are four parables. 1. That of the treasure hid in the field. Many slight the gospel, because they look only upon the surface of the field. But all who search the Scriptures, so as in them to find Christ and eternal life, Joh 5:39, will discover such treasure in this field as makes it unspeakably valuable; they make it their own upon any terms. Though nothing can be given as a price for this salvation, yet much must be given up for the sake of it. 2. All the children of men are busy; one would be rich, another would be honourable, another would be learned; but most are deceived, and take up with counterfeits for pearls. Jesus Christ is a Pearl of great price; in having him, we have enough to make us happy here and for ever. A man may buy gold too dear, but not this Pearl of great price. When the convinced sinner sees Christ as the gracious Saviour, all things else become worthless to his thoughts. 3. The world is a vast sea, and men, in their natural state, are like the fishes. Preaching the gospel is casting a net into this sea, to catch something out of it, for His glory who has the sovereignty of this sea. Hypocrites and true Christians shall be parted: miserable is the condition of those that shall then be cast away. 4. A skilful, faithful minister of the gospel, is a scribe, well versed in the things of the gospel, and able to teach them. Christ compares him to a good householder, who brings forth fruits of last year's growth and this year's gathering, abundance and variety, to entertain his friends. Old experiences and new observations, all have their use. Our place is at Christ's feet, and we must daily learn old lessons over again, and new ones also.</body></html>
