Justin Martyr (<span class= "ital">Dial. c. Tryph.</span> c. 88) relates that in his time articles said to have been made by Him, such as rakes and harrows, were in demand as relics. The apocryphal <span class= "ital">Gospel of the Infancy,</span> after its manner, makes Him instruct Joseph when he was bungling at his work.<p><span class= "bld">And his brethren.</span>--See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-46.htm" title="While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood without, desiring to speak with him.">Matthew 12:46</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Joses.</span>--The authority of MSS. is in favour of the reading, "Joseph." It was, of course, probable that the name of the father should be borne by one of those who were in some sense his children.

In the Apocryphal Gospels our Lord is not represented as a carpenter himself, but as helping Joseph by miraculously lengthening a piece of wood which Joseph had cut too short (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> 'Pseudo-Matthew,' &sect; 37; 'Gospel of Thomas,' first Greek form, &sect; 13; contrast Justin Martyr, Dial. with Trypho,' &sect; 88). <span class="cmt_word">Is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-46.htm">Matthew 12:46</a>).

They upbraid him, Is not this the carpenter's son? Yes, it is true he was reputed to be so; and no disgrace to be the son of an honest tradesman; they should have respected him the more because he was one of themselves, but therefore they despised him. He did not many mighty works there, because of their unbelief. Unbelief is the great hinderance to Christ's favours. Let us keep faithful to him as the Saviour who has made our peace with God.</body></html>
