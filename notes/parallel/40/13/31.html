And, so far as we can judge, they seem to have been equal to the task. They ask for the meaning of the Tares, but we read of no question about these.<p>It is scarcely necessary to discuss at any length the botany of the parable. What we call mustard (<span class= "ital">Sinapis nigra</span>) does not grow in the East, any more than with us, into anything that can be called a tree. Probably, however, the name was used widely for any plant that had the pungent flavour of mustard, and botanists have suggested the <span class= "ital">Salvadora persica</span> as answering to the description. (See <span class= "ital">Bible Educator,</span> I. 119.)<p>The interpretation of the parable lies almost on the surface. Here again the sower is the Son of Man; but the seed in this case is not so much the "word," as the Christian society, the Church, which forms, so to speak, the firstfruits of the word. As it then was, even as it was on the day of Pentecost, it was smaller than any sect or party in Palestine or Greece or Italy. It was sown in God's field of the world, but it was to grow till it became greater than any sect or school, a tree among the trees of the forest, a kingdom among other kingdoms (comp. the imagery of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-3.htm" title="Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.">Ezekiel 31:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-10.htm" title="Thus were the visions of my head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the middle of the earth, and the height thereof was great.">Daniel 4:10</a>), a great organised society; and the "birds of the air" (no longer, as before, the emblems of evil)--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the systems of thought, institutions, and the like, of other races--were to find refuge under its protection. History has witnessed many fulfilments of the prophecy implied in the parable, and those who believe that the life of Christendom is an abiding life will look for yet more.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31, 32.</span> - <span class="accented">The parable of the mustard seed.</span> Parallel passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-30.htm">Mark 4:30-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-18.htm">Luke 13:18, 19</a>. The central thought of the parable is the growth of the kingdom of heaven considered externally. Although it has small beginnings, it is to have a marvellous expansion, so that even those who naturally are outside it are glad to avail themselves of its protection. Observe that we have no right to limit its growth either to the reputation of its principles alone or to the power of its organization; both are included. Regarded as a prophecy, the parable is partially fulfilled every time that a heathen nation places itself under the protection of a Christian nation, and more truly fulfilled whenever a nation accepts Christianity as its own religion. It is parodied when a nation or a collection of nations submits its political freedom to the dictates of claimants to spiritual superiority, whether these claim to have received such superiority as an inheritance from the past, or to have acquired it in the present. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Another parable put he forth unto them</span> (ver. 24, note), <span class="cmt_word">saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto</span> (ver. 24, note; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-16.htm">Matthew 11:16</a>, note) <span class="cmt_word">a grain of mustard seed.</span> "The Common Mustard of Palestine is <span class="accented">Sinapis nigra</span>, of the order <span class="accented">Cruciferae</span>, the Black Mustard, which is found abundantly in a wild state, and is also cultivated in the gardens for its seed. It is the same as our own Mustard, but grows especially in the richer soils of the Jordan valley to a much greater size than in this country. We noticed its great height on the banks of the Jordan, as have several other travellers; and Dr. Thomson remarks that in the Plain of Acre he has seen it as tall as a horse and its rider" (Tristram, 'Nat. Hist. of Bible,' p. 472, edit. 1889). <span class="cmt_word">Which a man took.</span> The insertion of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> is probably to exclude the idea of a chance sowing. True that the seed might, under certain circumstances, then grow as well, but the reality which is being described was the result of long and deliberate purpose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-3.htm">Titus 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And sowed in his field.</span> "His garden" (Luke) suggests a piece of ground that was at once smaller and more cared for. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:31-35 The scope of the parable of the seed sown, is to show that the beginnings of the gospel would be small, but its latter end would greatly increase; in this way the work of grace in the heart, the kingdom of God within us, would be carried on. In the soul where grace truly is, it will grow really; though perhaps at first not to be discerned, it will at last come to great strength and usefulness. The preaching of the gospel works like leaven in the hearts of those who receive it. The leaven works certainly, so does the word, yet gradually. It works silently, and without being seen, Mr 4:26-29, yet strongly; without noise, for so is the way of the Spirit, but without fail. Thus it was in the world. The apostles, by preaching the gospel, hid a handful of leaven in the great mass of mankind. It was made powerful by the Spirit of the Lord of hosts, who works, and none can hinder. Thus it is in the heart. When the gospel comes into the soul, it works a thorough change; it spreads itself into all the powers and faculties of the soul, and alters the property even of the members of the body, Ro 6:13. From these parables we are taught to expect a gradual progress; therefore let us inquire, Are we growing in grace? and in holy principles and habits?</body></html>
