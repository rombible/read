In itself it would naturally be understood of persons, in accordance with the meaning of "tares." But what is its relation to the following clause, for this latter cannot be merely tautological? There are two answers: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> The two phrases bring out different aspects under which the persons are regarded. They, as "sons of the evil one," are both stumbling blocks to others ("the sons of the kingdom"), and also active workers of lawlessness (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>). They sin against men (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>b) and against God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> The first term regards not so much them as their actions - their scandalous acts (Goebel); the second, the persons themselves. The former of the two answers seems preferable, as keeping closer to the parable. It also agrees with the personal use of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-23.htm">Matthew 16:23</a>, and the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> alone in the next clause. With respect to the whole phrase, observe: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It is taken partly from <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-3.htm">Zephaniah 1:3</a> (Hebrew), "I will consume [the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;</span> would readily lend itself to the interpretation 'gather']... the stumbling blocks with the wicked (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5de;&#x5db;&#x5e9;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5e8;&#x5e9;&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>... <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e1;&#x5e4;</span>)." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Yet, as it stands, it is taken partly also from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-1.htm">Psalm 37:1</a>, for the Greek of <span class="accented">them that do iniquity is</span> the same as in the LXX. there. Besides, the context (comp. Kirkpatrick) is not dissimilar; it is that the righteous should not be envious at the prosperity of the wicked, for it is only transitory, "They shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The phrase, <span class="accented">them which do iniquity</span> (rather, <span class="accented">lawlessness</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-23.htm">Matthew 7:23</a>, note), looks as though St. Paul's teaching of "the man of sin" (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>: Westcott and Hort, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>; cf. 7, 8) might have some basis in the direct teaching of the Lord (cf. ver. 43, note; and on this question generally, Chase, 'The Lord's Prayer,' etc., p. 19). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Ephraem Syrus, evidently quoting this passage, but in the form in which, presumably, it existed in the 'Diatessaron,' deduces from it that the earth will be the abode of the glorified saints: "Quod autem dicit: <span class="accented">Mandabit domum regni sui ab omni scandalo</span>, intellige de terra et rebus creatis, quas renovabit, ibique justos suos collocabit" (Resch, 'Agrapha,' p. 295). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:31-35 The scope of the parable of the seed sown, is to show that the beginnings of the gospel would be small, but its latter end would greatly increase; in this way the work of grace in the heart, the kingdom of God within us, would be carried on. In the soul where grace truly is, it will grow really; though perhaps at first not to be discerned, it will at last come to great strength and usefulness. The preaching of the gospel works like leaven in the hearts of those who receive it. The leaven works certainly, so does the word, yet gradually. It works silently, and without being seen, Mr 4:26-29, yet strongly; without noise, for so is the way of the Spirit, but without fail. Thus it was in the world. The apostles, by preaching the gospel, hid a handful of leaven in the great mass of mankind. It was made powerful by the Spirit of the Lord of hosts, who works, and none can hinder. Thus it is in the heart. When the gospel comes into the soul, it works a thorough change; it spreads itself into all the powers and faculties of the soul, and alters the property even of the members of the body, Ro 6:13. From these parables we are taught to expect a gradual progress; therefore let us inquire, Are we growing in grace? and in holy principles and habits?</body></html>
