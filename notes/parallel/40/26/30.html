Arise, let us go hence.">John 14:31</a>, and, if so, we have to think of the conversation in John 14 as either coming between the departure of Judas and the institution of the Lord's Supper, or else between that institution and the concluding hymn. This was probably the received Paschal series of Psalms (Psalms 115-118, inclusive), and the word implies a chant or musical recitative. Psalms 113, 114, were sung commonly during the meal. The Greek word may mean "when they had sung their hymn," as of something known and definite.<p><span class= "bld">They went out into the mount of Olives.</span>--We must think of the breaking up of the Paschal company; of the fear and forebodings which pressed upon the minds of all, as they left the chamber and made their way, under the cold moonlight, through the streets of Jerusalem, down to the valley of the Kidron and up the western slope of Olivet. St. Luke records that His disciples followed Him, some near, some, it may be, afar off. The discourses reported in John 15, 16, 17, which must be assigned to this period in the evening, seem to imply a halt from time to time, during which the Master poured forth His heart to His disciples, or uttered intercessions for them. St. John, who had "lain in His bosom" at the supper, would naturally be nearest to Him now, and this may, in part at least, explain how it was that so full a report of all that was thus spoken appears in his Gospel, and in that only.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30-35.</span> - <span class="accented">Jesus announces the desertion of the apostles, and the denial of Peter.</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-26.htm">Mark 14:26-31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-34.htm">Luke 22:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-36.htm">John 13:36-38</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When they had sung an hymn.</span> This was probably the second portion of the Hallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115.htm">Psalm 115-118</a>, or, if the then ritual was the same as the later, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136.htm">Psalm 136</a>.).

Take, eat; accept of Christ as he is offered to you; receive the atonement, approve of it, submit to his grace and his government. Meat looked upon, be the dish ever so well garnished, will not nourish; it must be fed upon: so must the doctrine of Christ. This is my body; that is, spiritually, it signifies and represents his body. We partake of the sun, not by having the sun put into our hands, but the beams of it darted down upon us; so we partake of Christ by partaking of his grace, and the blessed fruits of the breaking of his body. The blood of Christ is signified and represented by the wine. He gave thanks, to teach us to look to God in every part of the ordinance. This cup he gave to the disciples with a command, Drink ye all of it. The pardon of sin is that great blessing which is, in the Lord's supper, conferred on all true believers; it is the foundation of all other blessings. He takes leave of such communion; and assures them of a happy meeting again at last; Until that day when I drink it new with you, may be understood of the joys and glories of the future state, which the saints shall partake with the Lord Jesus. That will be the kingdom of his Father; the wine of consolation will there be always new. While we look at the outward signs of Christ's body broken and his blood shed for the remission of our sins, let us recollect that the feast cost him as much as though he had literally given his flesh to be eaten and his blood for us to drink.</body></html>
