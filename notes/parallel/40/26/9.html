It might have been sold for three hundred <span class= "ital">denarii,</span> a labourer's wages for nearly a whole year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-2.htm" title="And when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.">Matthew 20:2</a>), enough <span class= "ital">to</span> feed a multitude of more than 7,500 men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-7.htm" title="Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.">John 6:7</a>). St. John adds the damning fact that the pretended zeal for the poor was the cloak for the irritation of disappointed greed. "He was a thief, and bare the bag." He was, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the treasurer or bursar of the travelling company, received the offerings of the wealthier disciples, and disbursed them either on their necessary expenditure or in alms to the poor (see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-6.htm" title="This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bore what was put therein.">John 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-29.htm" title="For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said to him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.">John 13:29</a>). This was the "one talent" given to him "according to his ability," and in dealing with it he proved fraudulent and faithless.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Might have been sold for much.</span> According to St. John, Judas had accurately estimated the value of the ointment at 300 denarii, equal to about &pound;9 of our money. When we remember that one denarius represented the daily wages of a labouring man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-2.htm">Matthew 20:2</a>), we see that the cost was very large. <span class="cmt_word">Given to the poor.</span> And this "much" given to the poor. But piety is not shown only in giving alms; the honour of God has a superior claim. And Mary was rich, and quite able to afford this offering without neglecting her almsgiving. "How often does charity serve as a cloak for covetousness! We must not neglect what we owe to Jesus Christ under pretence of what we owe his members. Men count as wasted what is expended in the outer worship of God, when they love neither God nor his worship. Jesus Christ authorizes it by accepting it at the very instant in which he was establishing religion by a worship the most spiritual and inward" (Quesnel). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:6-13 The pouring ointment upon the head of Christ was a token of the highest respect. Where there is true love in the heart to Jesus Christ, nothing will be thought too good to bestow upon him. The more Christ's servants and their services are cavilled at, the more he manifests his acceptance. This act of faith and love was so remarkable, that it would be reported, as a memorial of Mary's faith and love, to all future ages, and in all places where the gospel should be preached. This prophecy is fulfilled.</body></html>
