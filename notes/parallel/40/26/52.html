St. Mark reports none of the words; St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-51.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said, Suffer you thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.">Luke 22:51</a>) gives only the calming utterance, "Suffer ye thus far;" St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-11.htm" title="Then said Jesus to Peter, Put up your sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father has given me, shall I not drink it?">John 18:11</a>) adds to the command to put the sword into its sheath the words, "The cup which My Father hath given Me, shall I not drink it?" a manifest echo of the prayer that had been uttered before in the hour of His agony. The words which St. Matthew gives are obviously not a general rule declaring the unlawfulness of all warfare, offensive or defensive, but are limited in their range by the occasion. Resistance at that time would have involved certain destruction. More than that, it would have been fighting not for God, but against Him, because against the fulfilment of His purpose. It is, however, a natural inference from the words to see in them a warning applicable to all analogous occasions. In whatever other cause it may be lawful to use carnal weapons, it is not wise or right to draw the sword for Christ and His Truth. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-4.htm" title="(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)">2Corinthians 10:4</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 52.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Put up again thy sword into his</span> (<span class="accented">its</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>place.</span> Christ orders Peter to sheathe his sword; but the wording is peculiar, <span class="accented">Turn away</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented">thy sword</span>; as if Christ would say, "The sword is none of mine; the arm of flesh and the carnal weapon are thine; turn off thy sword from the use which thou art making of it to its proper destination, to be wielded only at God's command." Then he gives a motive for this injunction. <span class="cmt_word">For all they that take</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the sword shall perish with the sword.</span> There is a stress on the word "take," and there is an imperative force in the future, "shall perish." The Lord is speaking of those who arbitrarily and presumptuously resort to violence; and he says, "Let them feel the sword." The word was of wide application, and contained a universal truth; it was, in fact, a re-enactment of the primaeval law touching the sacredness of human life, and the penalty that ensues on its infringement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5, 6</a>). It enforced also the general lesson that violence and revenge effect no good end, and bring their own punishment. There is no prophecy here (as some suppose) of the destruction of the Jews at the hands of the Romans; nor is Christ intent on soothing Peter by the thought of the future retribution which awaited the enemies whom he was so eager to chastise. Such suggestions are arbitrary and unwarranted by the context. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:47-56 No enemies are so much to be abhorred as those professed disciples that betray Christ with a kiss. God has no need of our services, much less of our sins, to bring about his purposes. Though Christ was crucified through weakness, it was voluntary weakness; he submitted to death. If he had not been willing to suffer, they could not conquer him. It was a great sin for those who had left all to follow Jesus; now to leave him for they knew not what. What folly, for fear of death to flee from Him, whom they knew and acknowledged to be the Fountain of life!</body></html>
