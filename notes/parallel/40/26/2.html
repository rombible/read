Jesus appears to have passed this day in peaceful seclusion, either in Bethany or its neighbourhood. <span class="cmt_word">Is</span> the Feast of <span class="cmt_word">the Passover</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: <span class="accented">the Passover cometh</span>; <span class="accented">Pascha fiet.</span> The lambs were slain during the first evening of the 14th of Nisan, and were eaten within twelve hours. The word <span class="accented">Pascha</span> is the Greek form of the Hebrew <span class="accented">Pasach</span>, denoting "the passing over" of the destroying angel, when he destroyed the Egyptians, but left untouched the houses of the Israelites, on whose door posts was sprinkled the blood of the lamb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>.). Etymologically, it has nothing to do with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;</span>, and the Latin <span class="accented">patior, passio</span>, etc, though pious writers have seen a providential arrangement in the apparent similarity of the words (see the possible paronomasia in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-15.htm">Luke 22:15</a>). <span class="accented">Pascha</span> (<span class="accented">Pasach</span>) is used in three senses: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the transit of the angel; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the Paschal lamb; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the Feast of the Passover. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is in this last signification that it is here employed <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (equivalent to <span class="accented">when</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the Son of man is betrayed</span> (<span class="accented">delivered up</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">to be crucified.</span> Christ connects his own death with the Passover, not only as indicating the day and hour, but to mark the typical meaning and importance of this solemnity, when he, our Passover, should be sacrificed for us. The present tense, "is betrayed," denotes the imminence and certainty of the event. He sees the event as actually present. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:1-5 Our Lord had often told of his sufferings as at a distance, now he speaks of them as at hand. At the same time the Jewish council consulted how they might put him to death secretly. But it pleased God to defeat their intention. Jesus, the true paschal Lamb, was to be sacrificed for us at that very time, and his death and resurrection rendered public.</body></html>
