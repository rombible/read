He was indeed what the words they had uttered implied. More than this, He was also the Son of Man of Daniel's vision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a>), the Head of an everlasting kingdom. No words in the whole Gospel records are more decisive against the views of those who would fain see in our Lord only a great moral teacher, like Socrates or Cakya Mouni. At the very crisis of His history, when denial would have saved His life. He asserts His claim to be much more than this, to be all that the most devout Christians have ever believed Him to be. At such a moment, when men stand face to face with seeming failure and with death, dreams and delusive claims for the most part melt away. Here claims that men have presumed to think of as delusive were strengthened and intensified, and reproduced as in the calmness of assured conviction.<p><span class= "bld">The right hand of power.</span>--The Greek article here can hardly be reproduced in English, but it is well to remember that our Lord speaks of "<span class= "ital">the</span> power," that which belonged pre-eminently to the Eternal.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 64.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast said;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (ver. 25); in St. Mark, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>. This is a strong affirmative asseveration, and on Christ's lips carries with it the full meaning of the words used by Caiaphas, "I am the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One, God of God, of one substance with the Father." <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in spite of your incredulity.

Right hand of power. Of Omnipotence, of Almighty God. <span class="cmt_word">Coming in the clouds of heaven</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>). Christ thus distinctly asserts his Divinity, and claims to apply to himself the utterance in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, and the great prophecy of Daniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13, 14</a>). This was the plainest and most specific declaration of his real nature, power, and attributes, made with calm majesty, though he knew it was to seal his condemnation, and open the immediate way to his death. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:57-68 Jesus was hurried into Jerusalem. It looks ill, and bodes worse, when those who are willing to be Christ's disciples, are not willing to be known to be so. Here began Peter's denying him: for to follow Christ afar off, is to begin to go back from him. It is more our concern to prepare for the end, whatever it may be, than curiously to ask what the end will be. The event is God's, but the duty is ours. Now the Scriptures were fulfilled, which said, False witnesses are risen up against me. Christ was accused, that we might not be condemned; and if at any time we suffer thus, let us remember we cannot expect to fare better than our Master. When Christ was made sin for us, he was silent, and left it to his blood to speak. Hitherto Jesus had seldom professed expressly to be the Christ, the Son of God; the tenor of his doctrine spoke it, and his miracles proved it; but now he would not omit to make an open confession of it. It would have looked like declining his sufferings. He thus confessed, as an example and encouragement to his followers, to confess him before men, whatever hazard they ran. Disdain, cruel mocking, and abhorrence, are the sure portion of the disciple as they were of the Master, from such as would buffet and deride the Lord of glory. These things were exactly foretold in the fiftieth chapter of Isaiah. Let us confess Christ's name, and bear the reproach, and he will confess us before his Father's throne.</body></html>
