St. John fixes it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-1.htm" title="Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.">John 12:1</a>) at six days before the Passover, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> on the evening that preceded the entry into Jerusalem. It was, therefore, a feast such as Jews were wont to hold at the close of the Sabbath.<p><span class= "bld">In the house of Simon the leper.</span>--Of the man so described we know nothing beyond the fact thus mentioned. It is not likely, had he been a leper at the time, that men would have gathered to a feast at his house, and it is natural to infer that our Lord had healed him, but that the name still adhered to him to distinguish him from other Simons. We learn from St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-2.htm" title="There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.">John 12:2</a>) that Lazarus was there, and that Martha, true to her character, was busy "serving." The Twelve were also there, and probably many others. The incident that follows is narrated by all the Evangelists except St. Luke, who may either not have heard it from his informants, or, if he had heard it, may have passed it over as having already recorded a fact of like character (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/7-37.htm" title="And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,">Luke 7:37-40</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-13.</span> - <span class="accented">The anointing at Bethany.</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-1.htm">John 12:1-8</a>.) This parenthetical episode is introduced by the two synoptists out of its chronological order, with the view of indicating the immediate cause of Judas's resolution to betray his Master, the issue of which they proceed to narrate (see on ver. 14). This anointing must not be confounded with that related by St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-37.htm">Luke 7:37</a>, etc.), where the scene, the time, and the actor were different, and the significance was of a very inferior nature. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Jesus was in Bethany.</span> St. John tells us that the incident took place six days before the Passover, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on the Saturday preceding Palm Sunday. It is St. Matthew's custom to describe events not always in their historical sequence, but according to some logical or spiritual connection which in his mind overrides considerations of time or place. (For Bethany, see on Matthew 21:1.) <span class="cmt_word">Simon the leper</span>. Not that he was a leper now, but either the appellation was hereditary, in reference to some such malady inflicted on his family, or he himself, having been cured by Christ, retained the name in memory of his cleansing. So St. Matthew is called "the publican" after he had relinquished his obnoxious business (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-3.htm">Matthew 10:3</a>), and the revived man is termed "the dead" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-15.htm">Luke 7:15</a>). The frequency of the name Simon among the Jews rendered the addition of a surname expedient; thus we have Simon the Cananite, Simon the tanner, Simon Bar-john, etc. Nothing certain is known about this person. Tradition makes him father of Lazarus or husband of Martha. That he was connected with the holy family of Bethany, either by relationship or close friendship, seems to be well established. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:6-13 The pouring ointment upon the head of Christ was a token of the highest respect. Where there is true love in the heart to Jesus Christ, nothing will be thought too good to bestow upon him. The more Christ's servants and their services are cavilled at, the more he manifests his acceptance. This act of faith and love was so remarkable, that it would be reported, as a memorial of Mary's faith and love, to all future ages, and in all places where the gospel should be preached. This prophecy is fulfilled.</body></html>
