They were expecting that "the kingdom of God should immediately appear" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-11.htm" title="And as they heard these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.">Luke 19:11</a>), and were looking forward to the dawn of the next day as the hour of its victory and triumph. The enthusiasm of the moment made them deaf to the real import of what they heard, and their Master, alone of all that company, knew that the fragrance of that perfume would not have died away when His body should be laid in the sepulchre.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On my body, she did it for my burial</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">to prepare me for burial</span>). This doubtless was in some sort her intention (see on ver 10). She desired to offer what she could (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-8.htm">Mark 14:8</a>) of the offices and attentions due to the corpse of a beloved and revered Friend. Christ interpreted her act, and gave it a solemn significance. By this effusion of the precious unguent site anticipated the embalming of the Lord's body; she showed her reverence for that body which was to be given for the life of the world not many days hence. The full meaning of the mystery of which she was the instrument Mary did not comprehend, but what she had consciously done received a wonderful commendation from the Lord, which has no parallel in the Gospel history. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:6-13 The pouring ointment upon the head of Christ was a token of the highest respect. Where there is true love in the heart to Jesus Christ, nothing will be thought too good to bestow upon him. The more Christ's servants and their services are cavilled at, the more he manifests his acceptance. This act of faith and love was so remarkable, that it would be reported, as a memorial of Mary's faith and love, to all future ages, and in all places where the gospel should be preached. This prophecy is fulfilled.</body></html>
