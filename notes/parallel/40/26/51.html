The servant's name was Malchus.">John 18:10-11</a>) records the names both of the disciple who struck the blow (Peter) and of the servant whom he attacked. The reticence of the first three Gospels in this instance, as in that of the woman with the box of ointment, must have been obviously intentional; but it is not easy to conjecture its motive.<p><span class= "bld">Drew his sword.</span>--We learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-33.htm" title="And he said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with you, both into prison, and to death.">Luke 22:33</a> that there were but two swords in the whole company of the twelve. One of these naturally was in Peter's possession, as being the foremost of the whole band.<p><span class= "bld">A servant of the high priest's.</span>--St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-11.htm" title="Then said Jesus to Peter, Put up your sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father has given me, shall I not drink it?">John 18:11</a>) with the precision characteristic of his narrative, especially in this part of the Gospel history, gives the servant's name as Malchus, and states that it was the right ear that was cut off. He came, it would seem, not as one of the officers of the Temple, but as the personal slave of Caiaphas. Three of the four Gospels use the diminutive form of the Greek for "ear," St. Luke only (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-50.htm" title="And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.">Luke 22:50</a>) giving the primitive word. It is doubtful, however, whether the former was used with any special significance. St. Luke also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-51.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said, Suffer you thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.">Luke 22:51</a>) alone records the fact that our Lord touched and healed the wound thus made.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">One of them which were with Jesus.</span> St. John names Peter as the agent in the attack on the high priest's servant; he also alone gives the name of the servant, Malchus. Of the circumstances which led to the subsequent miracle all the evangelists give an account; the miracle itself is related only by St. Luke. Conjecture has attempted to give reasons for these deficiencies in some of the narratives, and the complementary details in others; but it is wisest to say that thus it has seemed good to the Holy Ghost who guided the writers, and there to leave the subject. <span class="cmt_word">Drew his sword.</span> The apostles had evidently misunderstood the Lord's words uttered a little while before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-36.htm">Luke 22:36-38</a>), "He that hath no sword, let him sell his cloke, and buy one." Two of them had then exhibited the weapons with which they had armed themselves, as if ready to repel violence And now one of these, thinking that the hour was arrived for striking a blow in his Master's defence, resorted to violence. Physical courage, indeed, Peter possessed, as was proved by his attitude in the face of fearful odds, but of moral courage he and his comrades exhibited little evidence, when, as soon as their Master was apprehended and led away, they "all forsook him, and fled" (ver. 56). <span class="cmt_word">Struck a</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>servant of the high</span> <span class="cmt_word">priest's.</span> The man was the high priest's servant in a special way - what we should call his bodyservant; he had evidently made himself conspicuous in the arrest, and Peter struck fiercely at his head as the foremost of the aggressors. St. John, who was acquainted with the high priest and his household, gives his name as Malchus, a Syriac word, meaning "Counsellor." <span class="cmt_word">Smote off his ear.</span> The blow fell short, but inflicted a serious wound. How the mischief was repaired by the healing touch of Christ is mentioned alone by Luke the physician, for whom the incident would have special interest. We may note, in passing, that this miracle (the last which Christ worked before his death) was wholly unsolicited and unexpected on the part of the recipient, and was performed upon an enemy actually engaged in hostility. What more striking proof of the Lord's mercy and forgiveness could have been given? What better way could there be of demonstrating the nature of the kingdom which he came to establish? Thus he displayed his superhuman power even while surrendering himself to captivity and death. By this immediate action too he secured his followers from reprisal, so that they were allowed to retire unmolested, and Peter, though recognized to have been one of those in the garden (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-26.htm">John 18:26</a>), was not punished for his part in the transaction. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:47-56 No enemies are so much to be abhorred as those professed disciples that betray Christ with a kiss. God has no need of our services, much less of our sins, to bring about his purposes. Though Christ was crucified through weakness, it was voluntary weakness; he submitted to death. If he had not been willing to suffer, they could not conquer him. It was a great sin for those who had left all to follow Jesus; now to leave him for they knew not what. What folly, for fear of death to flee from Him, whom they knew and acknowledged to be the Fountain of life!</body></html>
