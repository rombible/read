So in the prophet's words succeeding the quotation there is a similar encouragement, "I will turn mine hand upon the little ones;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I will cover and protect the humble and meek, even after they fled and were scattered. <span class="cmt_word">I will go before you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>into Galilee</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-7.htm">Matthew 28:7</a>). The verb is of pastoral signification, as in the East the shepherd does not drive his sheep, but leads them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-4.htm">John 10:4</a>). The apostles, or many of them, after the Resurrection, returned to their old homes in Galilee, but Christ preceded them, and they found him there before them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-7.htm">Mark 16:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21.htm">John 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>). He again gathered around him his little flock lately scattered. True, he had then already appeared to them at Jerusalem more than once; but this was, as it were, fortuitously and unexpectedly. The meeting in Galilee was by appointment, and of most solemn import, Christ then reuniting the apostolic body, and renewing the apostolic commission (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18-20</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:31-35 Improper self-confidence, like that of Peter, is the first step to a fall. There is a proneness in all of us to be over-confident. But those fall soonest and foulest, who are the most confident in themselves. Those are least safe, who think themselves most secure. Satan is active to lead such astray; they are most off their guard: God leaves them to themselves, to humble them.</body></html>
