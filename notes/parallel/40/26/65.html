The judges in a Jewish trial for blasphemy were bound to rend their clothes in twain when the blasphemous words were uttered, and the clothes so torn were never afterwards to be mended. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-14.htm" title="Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,">Acts 14:14</a> the same act appears, on the part of Paul and Barnabas, as the expression of an impulsive horror, as it had done of old when Eliakim rent his clothes on hearing the blasphemies of Rabshaken (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-37.htm" title="Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.">2Kings 18:37</a>). A comparison of the Greek word here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-63.htm" title="Then the high priest rent his clothes, and said, What need we any further witnesses?">Mark 14:63</a> shows that it included the tunic or under-garment as well as the cloak.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 65.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The high priest rent his clothes</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>). His outer garments, not his pontifical vestment, which he would not wear on this occasion. St. Mark notes that he rent his under clothes, his tunic; so probably he tore both outer and inner garments. This was done in assumed horror at Christ's blasphemy (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-37.htm">2 Kings 18:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-1.htm">2 Kings 19:1</a>), rabbinical injunctions requiring such an action, and prescribing the nature, extent, and direction of the scissure. "This he did," says Chrysostom, "to add force to the accusation, and to increase the weight of his words by the act." His assessors, though fully agreeing with him, appear not to have followed his example in this particular, taking the high priest's action as typical and sufficiently expressive of the general sentiment. The Fathers see in it a symbol of the rending and destruction of the Jewish priesthood (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-27.htm">1 Samuel 15:27, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-30.htm">1 Kings 11:30, 31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He hath</span> <span class="cmt_word">spoken blasphemy</span>. In claiming to be the Son of God, not in a theocratic sense, but by nature. making himself one with Jehovah. This was what Caiaphas had been desiring. No more discussion was needed; Christ was self-convicted. <span class="cmt_word">What further need have we of witnesses?</span> He was doubtless relieved to find that the Prisoner had saved him from the trouble of seeking, suborning, and examining any more witnesses. <span class="cmt_word">Ye have heard;</span> <span class="accented">ye heard</span> just now. All the assembly could now testify to the truth of the allegation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:57-68 Jesus was hurried into Jerusalem. It looks ill, and bodes worse, when those who are willing to be Christ's disciples, are not willing to be known to be so. Here began Peter's denying him: for to follow Christ afar off, is to begin to go back from him. It is more our concern to prepare for the end, whatever it may be, than curiously to ask what the end will be. The event is God's, but the duty is ours. Now the Scriptures were fulfilled, which said, False witnesses are risen up against me. Christ was accused, that we might not be condemned; and if at any time we suffer thus, let us remember we cannot expect to fare better than our Master. When Christ was made sin for us, he was silent, and left it to his blood to speak. Hitherto Jesus had seldom professed expressly to be the Christ, the Son of God; the tenor of his doctrine spoke it, and his miracles proved it; but now he would not omit to make an open confession of it. It would have looked like declining his sufferings. He thus confessed, as an example and encouragement to his followers, to confess him before men, whatever hazard they ran. Disdain, cruel mocking, and abhorrence, are the sure portion of the disciple as they were of the Master, from such as would buffet and deride the Lord of glory. These things were exactly foretold in the fiftieth chapter of Isaiah. Let us confess Christ's name, and bear the reproach, and he will confess us before his Father's throne.</body></html>
