And he was speechless.">Matthew 22:12</a>; and "comrade," and the old and not yet obsolete English "mate," come nearer to its meaning. In classical Greek it was used by fellow-soldiers, or sailors, of each other. Socrates used it in conversing with his scholars (Plato, <span class= "ital">Repub.</span> i., p. 334). It is probably immediately after the kiss had thus been given that we must insert the short dialogue between our Lord and the officers recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/18-2.htm" title="And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus often resorted thither with his disciples.">John 18:2-8</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Friend</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;</span>: <span class="accented">companion</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-13.htm">Matthew 20:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-12.htm">Matthew 22:12</a>). The word seems, in the New Testament, to be always addressed to the evil, though in itself an expression of affection. Here Christ uses no reproach; to the last he endeavours by kindness andlove to win the traitor to a better mind. St. Luke narrates that Jesus called him by name, saying, "Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?" <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Wherefore art thou come?</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. The Received Text gives <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x1ff7;</span>, which has very inferior authority. There is great difficulty in giving an exact interpretation of this clause. The Authorized Version, as the Vulgate (<span class="accented">Ad quid venisti?</span>), takes it interrogatively; but such a use of the relative <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;</span> is unknown. If it is interrogative, we must understand, "Is it this for which thou art come?" But Christ knew too well the purport of Judas's arrival to put such an unnecessary question. Others explain, "Do that, or, I know that for which thou art come." Alford, Farrar, and others consider the sentence as unfinished, the concluding member being suppressed by an aposiopesis consequent on the agitation of the Speaker, "That errand on which thou hast come - <span class="accented">complete."</span> More probably the clause is an exclamation, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;</span> being equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, as in later Greek, "For what a purpose art thou here!" It is, indeed, a last remonstrance and appeal to the conscience of the traitor. <span class="cmt_word">Took him.</span> They seized him with their hands, but did not bind him till afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-2.htm">John 18:2</a>). Whether Judas had any latent hope or expectation that Jesus at this supreme moment would assert and justify his Messiahship, we know not. The histories give no hint of any such idea, and it is most improbable that the apostate was thus influenced (see on ver. 14). We must here introduce the incident recorded by St. John (John 18:4-9). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:47-56 No enemies are so much to be abhorred as those professed disciples that betray Christ with a kiss. God has no need of our services, much less of our sins, to bring about his purposes. Though Christ was crucified through weakness, it was voluntary weakness; he submitted to death. If he had not been willing to suffer, they could not conquer him. It was a great sin for those who had left all to follow Jesus; now to leave him for they knew not what. What folly, for fear of death to flee from Him, whom they knew and acknowledged to be the Fountain of life!</body></html>
