Here, also, they were unconsciously working out a complete correspondence with Isaiah's picture of the righteous sufferer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-6.htm" title="From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.">Isaiah 1:6</a>). The word "buffeted" describes a blow with the clenched fist, as contrasted with one with the open palm.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 67.</span> - The scene that ensued upon the verdict being pronounced is beyond measure hideous and unexampled. When the meeting broke up, Jesus was for a time left to the brutal cruelty and the unbridled insolence of the guards and servants. Involuntarily, by their profanity and coarseness, they fulfilled the words of the prophet, speaking in the Person of Messiah, "I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; I hid not my face from shame and spitting" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Did they spit in his face.</span> A monstrous indignity, so regarded by all people at all times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-14.htm">Numbers 12:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-9.htm">Deuteronomy 25:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-10.htm">Job 30:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Buffeted him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">struck him with fists. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Smote him with the palms of their hands</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). There is some doubt whether the verb here means "to smite with a rod" or "to slap in the face with the open hand;" but as we have already had mention of striking with the hands, it is probable that beating with a stick is here intended. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:57-68 Jesus was hurried into Jerusalem. It looks ill, and bodes worse, when those who are willing to be Christ's disciples, are not willing to be known to be so. Here began Peter's denying him: for to follow Christ afar off, is to begin to go back from him. It is more our concern to prepare for the end, whatever it may be, than curiously to ask what the end will be. The event is God's, but the duty is ours. Now the Scriptures were fulfilled, which said, False witnesses are risen up against me. Christ was accused, that we might not be condemned; and if at any time we suffer thus, let us remember we cannot expect to fare better than our Master. When Christ was made sin for us, he was silent, and left it to his blood to speak. Hitherto Jesus had seldom professed expressly to be the Christ, the Son of God; the tenor of his doctrine spoke it, and his miracles proved it; but now he would not omit to make an open confession of it. It would have looked like declining his sufferings. He thus confessed, as an example and encouragement to his followers, to confess him before men, whatever hazard they ran. Disdain, cruel mocking, and abhorrence, are the sure portion of the disciple as they were of the Master, from such as would buffet and deride the Lord of glory. These things were exactly foretold in the fiftieth chapter of Isaiah. Let us confess Christ's name, and bear the reproach, and he will confess us before his Father's throne.</body></html>
