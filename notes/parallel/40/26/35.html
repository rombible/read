To them He had been not only "righteous," but "good" and kind, and therefore for Him "they even dared to die." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-7.htm" title="For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.">Romans 5:7</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Though I should die with thee</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">even if I must die with thee</span>). Christ's explanation of his meaning only drew from Peter a more energetic asseveration of his constancy even unto death. "He thought he was able," says St. Augustine, "because he felt that he wished." The other apostles made a similar assertion, and Jesus said no more, leaving time to prove the truth of his sad foreboding. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:31-35 Improper self-confidence, like that of Peter, is the first step to a fall. There is a proneness in all of us to be over-confident. But those fall soonest and foulest, who are the most confident in themselves. Those are least safe, who think themselves most secure. Satan is active to lead such astray; they are most off their guard: God leaves them to themselves, to humble them.</body></html>
