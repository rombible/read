He adds, also, what lay in the nature of the case, that they were provided with "lanterns and torches" as well as weapons. It was now near the hour of dawn, but they must have left the city while there was at best only moonlight to guide them.

God has no need of our services, much less of our sins, to bring about his purposes. Though Christ was crucified through weakness, it was voluntary weakness; he submitted to death. If he had not been willing to suffer, they could not conquer him. It was a great sin for those who had left all to follow Jesus; now to leave him for they knew not what. What folly, for fear of death to flee from Him, whom they knew and acknowledged to be the Fountain of life!</body></html>
