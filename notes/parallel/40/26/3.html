What had happened since--the kingly entry, the expulsion of the money-changers, the way in which our Lord had baffled their attempt to entrap Him in His speech--would all work as so many motives to immediate action. The meeting now assembled may have been either a formal session of the Sanhedrin, or an informal conference of its chief members prior to the regular meeting. The former seems, on the whole, the more probable. The "chief priests" were the heads of the twenty-four courses; the elders of the people were the representatives--how elected or selected we do not know--of the citizens of Jerusalem. St. Mark and St. Luke name "scribes" instead of "elders." These two bodies may have been identical, but more probably the scribes of the Council represented the whole class of interpreters of the Law, who bore that name in its wider sense.<p><span class= "bld">The high priest, who was called Caiaphas.</span>--The name was a distinctive one added to his proper name of Joseph. Of his previous history we know that he had married the daughter of Annas, who had filled the office of high priest before him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-13.htm" title="And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.">John 18:13</a>), and who still occupied, possibly as <span class= "ital">Nasi</span> or President, an influential position in the Council and retained his titular pre-eminence. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-2.htm" title="Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.">Luke 3:2</a>.) He had been high priest from the commencement of our Lord's ministry, and had, therefore, watched His ministry in Jerusalem with a jealous fear. We may probably trace his influence in the mission of the scribes from Jerusalem, whom we have seen as opponents of that ministry in Galilee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-22.htm" title="And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casts he out devils.">Mark 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-17.htm" title="And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.">Luke 5:17</a>). The meeting in his house implied a coalition of parties commonly opposed, for Caiaphas and his personal adherents were Sadducees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-17.htm" title="Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,">Acts 5:17</a>), and as such, courted the favour of their Roman rulers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-48.htm" title="If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.">John 11:48</a>), while the scribes were, for the most part, Pharisees, and assertors of national independence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-5.</span> - <span class="accented">Conspiracy of the Jewish rulers.</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-1.htm">Mark 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-2.htm">Luke 22:2</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>.

The office of high priest had originally been held for life; but of late the civil power had often deposed one and appointed another, so that there were at times many who had held the post, and who, as well as their deputies, and the heads of the courses, claimed the title of chief priest. These were all members of the Sanhedrim And the scribes, These words are omitted on very good authority by many modern editors. They are not found in the Vulgate, though they occur in the parallel passages in the other synoptists. If genuine, they, in connection with "elders" and "priests," would signify that all the elements of the Sanhedrin were present at this council. <span class="cmt_word">The palace</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the high priest.</span> This, then, was not a formal meeting, or it would have been held in the hall Gazith, "the hall of hewn stones," on the south side of the court of the priests. It was assembled in the court of the high priest's house, because it comprised persons who were not Sanhedrists, such as temple officials, and connections of the high priest, forming what was known as the priestly council, which was the official medium between the Roman authorities and the people. <span class="cmt_word">Who was called Caiaphas.</span> Josephus ('Ant.,' 18:02. 2) speaks of him as "Joseph, who is also Caiaphas;" hence the way in which he is introduced in the present passage. He had been elevated to his high post by the Romans, who found in him a submissive tool. His father-in-law. Annas had been appointed by Quirinius, but after nine years had been deposed; he was succeeded in turn by Ismael, Eleazar son of Annas, Simon, and fourthly by Caiaphas, who superseded his immediate predecessor by the favour of the procurator Valerius Gratus, the tenant of the office before Pontius Pilate. The ex-high priest, Annas, was counted still by some rigorists as holding the office, and he appears to have possessed high authority (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-13.htm">John 18:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-6.htm">Acts 4:6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:1-5 Our Lord had often told of his sufferings as at a distance, now he speaks of them as at hand. At the same time the Jewish council consulted how they might put him to death secretly. But it pleased God to defeat their intention. Jesus, the true paschal Lamb, was to be sacrificed for us at that very time, and his death and resurrection rendered public.</body></html>
