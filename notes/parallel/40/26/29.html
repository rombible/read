The words carry us into a region of mystic symbolism. Never afterwards while He tarried upon earth was He to taste of the wine-cup with His disciples. But in the kingdom of God, completed and perfected, He would be with them once again, and then Master and disciples would be alike sharers in that joy in the Holy Ghost, of which wine--new wine--was the appropriate symbol. The language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-2.htm" title="She has killed her beasts; she has mingled her wine; she has also furnished her table.">Proverbs 9:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-6.htm" title="And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make to all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.">Isaiah 25:6</a>, helps us to enter into the meaning of the words. Even the mocking taunt of the multitude on the day of Pentecost, "These men are full of new wine" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-13.htm" title="Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.">Acts 2:13</a>), may have recalled the mysterious promise to the minds of the Apostles, and enabled them to comprehend that it was through the gift of the Spirit that they were entering, in part at least, even then, into the joy of their Lord.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will not drink</span> <span class="cmt_word">henceforth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;</span>' <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of this fruit</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the vine.</span> He is about to die. From this moment forward he tastes not the cup. It does not follow that he had partaken of the consecrated wine which he gave his apostles. Probability is against his having done so (see on ver. 26). He used the same words with the first cup at the commencement of the supper (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-18.htm">Luke 22:18</a>). Of this he probably partook, but not of the latter. The offspring of the vine is a poetical way of describing wine (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-9.htm">Deuteronomy 22:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-12.htm">Isaiah 32:12</a>, etc.). It is absurd to find in this term an argument for unalcoholic grape juice. Wine, to be wine, must undergo fermentation, and if it is not to putrefy or to become vinegar, it must develop alcohol. <span class="cmt_word">When I drink it new</span> (<span class="greek_word">kaino/n</span>) <span class="cmt_word">with you in my</span> <span class="cmt_word">Father's kingdom.</span> This mysterious announcement has been variously interpreted, and its meaning must remain uncertain. Some refer it to Christ's intercourse with his disciples after he rose from the dead, when <span class="accented">e.g.</span> he partook of food with them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-30.htm">Luke 24:30, 42, 43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-12.htm">John 21:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-41.htm">Acts 10:41</a>). But this seems hardly to meet the requirements of the text, though it has the support of Chrysostom, who writes, "Because he had discoursed with them concerning Passion and cross, he again introduces what he has to say of his resurrection, having made mention of a kingdom before them, and by this term calling his own resurrection. And wherefore did be drink after he was risen again? Lest the grosser sort might suppose that the resurrection was a phantasy To show, therefore, that they should see him manifestly risen again, and that he should be with them once more, and that they themselves shall be witness to the things that are done, both by sight and by act, he saith, 'until I drink it new with you,' you bearing witness. But what is 'new'? In a new, that is, in a strange manner, not having a passible body, but now immortal and incorruptible, and not needing food." Some explain it of the Passover, of which he then partook for the last time, the type being fulfilled in him. The solution does not explain the new participation in the kingdom of God. It seems, on the whole, best to understand it as a prophecy of the great marriage supper of the Lamb, and the joys that await the faithful in the new heavens and the new earth. The wine is (he token of the felicities of this dispensation, and it is called "new" in contrast with the obsolete character of that which it superseded. "Novitatem dicit plane eingularem" (Bengel). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:26-30 This ordinance of the Lord's supper is to us the passover supper, by which we commemorate a much greater deliverance than that of Israel out of Egypt. Take, eat; accept of Christ as he is offered to you; receive the atonement, approve of it, submit to his grace and his government. Meat looked upon, be the dish ever so well garnished, will not nourish; it must be fed upon: so must the doctrine of Christ. This is my body; that is, spiritually, it signifies and represents his body. We partake of the sun, not by having the sun put into our hands, but the beams of it darted down upon us; so we partake of Christ by partaking of his grace, and the blessed fruits of the breaking of his body. The blood of Christ is signified and represented by the wine. He gave thanks, to teach us to look to God in every part of the ordinance. This cup he gave to the disciples with a command, Drink ye all of it. The pardon of sin is that great blessing which is, in the Lord's supper, conferred on all true believers; it is the foundation of all other blessings. He takes leave of such communion; and assures them of a happy meeting again at last; Until that day when I drink it new with you, may be understood of the joys and glories of the future state, which the saints shall partake with the Lord Jesus. That will be the kingdom of his Father; the wine of consolation will there be always new. While we look at the outward signs of Christ's body broken and his blood shed for the remission of our sins, let us recollect that the feast cost him as much as though he had literally given his flesh to be eaten and his blood for us to drink.</body></html>
