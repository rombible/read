Then said Jesus to him, That you do, do quickly.">John 13:27</a>). Did his Master (he calls Him by the wonted title of honour, Rabbi) indeed know his guilt? It would appear from St. John's narrative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-29.htm" title="For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said to him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.">John 13:29</a>) that the dread answer, "Thou hast said;" was not heard by all. All that they did hear was the command, "What thou doest, do quickly;" and some at least, probably the rest who were not in the secret of the signal, thought that that command referred to some matter connected with his customary work as the bursar of the company. He was to buy what was needed for the feast (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> probably, the customary solemn meal, or <span class= "ital">Chagigah,</span> of the day that followed on the Paschal Supper), or to give alms to the poor. He, however, understood the meaning of the words, and straightway went out (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/13-27.htm" title="And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus to him, That you do, do quickly.">John 13:27-30</a>). It follows, from this view of the sequence of events, that though he had eaten bread with his Master, he did not partake of the bread and the cup that were to be the signs of the New Covenant. At this stage St. John inserts the words as to the new commandment, "that ye should love another," which was embodied in that act of fellowship.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Answered and said, Master, is it I?</span> <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>; <span class="accented">It is not I, is it?</span> as ver. 22. Judas probably had not been one of those who put this question before, and now, availing himself of his proximity to Jesus (see on ver. 23), he has the inconceivable effrontery to make this inquiry privately, as if to assure himself whether Christ was conscious of his treachery or not. It is remarked that he does not call Jesus "Lord," as the other apostles, but "Rabbi," a coldly ceremonious title (so in the garden, ver. 49) The gentle Jeans reproaches him not, but answers him in low tones unheard by the rest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-28.htm">John 13:28, 29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast said.</span> A common formula, equivalent to "yes." So ver. 64. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:17-25 Observe, the place for their eating the passover was pointed out by Christ to the disciples. He knows those hidden ones who favour his cause, and will graciously visit all who are willing to receive him. The disciples did as Jesus had appointed. Those who would have Christ's presence in the gospel passover, must do what he says. It well becomes the disciples of Christ always to be jealous over themselves, especially in trying times. We know not how strongly we may be tempted, nor how far God may leave us to ourselves, therefore we have reason not to be high-minded, but to fear. Heart-searching examination and fervent prayer are especially proper before the Lord's supper, that, as Christ our Passover is now sacrificed for us, we may keep this feast, renewing our repentance, our faith in his blood, and surrendering ourselves to his service.</body></html>
