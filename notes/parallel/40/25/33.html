The sheep are the type of the docile, the profitable, the innocent, the good (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-7.htm">Romans 2:7, 10</a>). The right hand is the place of favour and honour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-17.htm">Genesis 48:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-11.htm">Luke 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-5.htm">Mark 16:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The goats</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">kids</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>on the left.</span> The diminutive is here used for the goats, to convey an impression of their worthlessness. Compare <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, "whelps," in the conversation of our Lord with the Syro-Phoenician woman (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-26.htm">Matthew 15:26, 27</a>). They are the type of the unruly, the proud (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>, Hebrew), the unprofitable, the evil (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-8.htm">Romans 2:8, 9</a>). This judicial distinction between the right and left hands is found in classical writers. Thus Plato, 'De Republica,' 10:13, tells of what a certain man, who revived after a cataleptic attack, saw when his soul left his body. he came to a mysterious place, where were two chasms in the earth, and two openings in the heavens opposite to them, and the judges of the dead sat between these. And when they gave judgment, they commanded the just to go on the right hand, and upwards through the heavens; but the unjust they sent to the left, and downwards; and both the just and unjust had upon them the marks of what they had done in the body. So Virgil makes the Elysian Fields to lie on the right of the palace of Dis, and the penal Tartarus on the left ('AEn.,' 6:540, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:31-46 This is a description of the last judgment. It is as an explanation of the former parables. There is a judgment to come, in which every man shall be sentenced to a state of everlasting happiness, or misery. Christ shall come, not only in the glory of his Father, but in his own glory, as Mediator. The wicked and godly here dwell together, in the same cities, churches, families, and are not always to be known the one from the other; such are the weaknesses of saints, such the hypocrisies of sinners; and death takes both: but in that day they will be parted for ever. Jesus Christ is the great Shepherd; he will shortly distinguish between those that are his, and those that are not. All other distinctions will be done away; but the great one between saints and sinners, holy and unholy, will remain for ever. The happiness the saints shall possess is very great. It is a kingdom; the most valuable possession on earth; yet this is but a faint resemblance of the blessed state of the saints in heaven. It is a kingdom prepared. The Father provided it for them in the greatness of his wisdom and power; the Son purchased it for them; and the blessed Spirit, in preparing them for the kingdom, is preparing it for them. It is prepared for them: it is in all points adapted to the new nature of a sanctified soul. It is prepared from the foundation of the world. This happiness was for the saints, and they for it, from all eternity. They shall come and inherit it. What we inherit is not got by ourselves. It is God that makes heirs of heaven. We are not to suppose that acts of bounty will entitle to eternal happiness. Good works done for God's sake, through Jesus Christ, are here noticed as marking the character of believers made holy by the Spirit of Christ, and as the effects of grace bestowed on those who do them. The wicked in this world were often called to come to Christ for life and rest, but they turned from his calls; and justly are those bid to depart from Christ, that would not come to him. Condemned sinners will in vain offer excuses. The punishment of the wicked will be an everlasting punishment; their state cannot be altered. Thus life and death, good and evil, the blessing and the curse, are set before us, that we may choose our way, and as our way so shall our end be.</body></html>
