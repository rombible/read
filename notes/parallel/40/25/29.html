What is noteworthy here is the extreme generality with which the law is stated. Analogies of that law are, it need even scarcely be said, to be found both in nature and in human society. Non-user tends to invalidate legal right. A muscle that is not exercised tends to degenerate and lose its power.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto every one that hath... abundance</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-12.htm">Matthew 13:12</a>). So we have seen in the first part of the parable. The proverb says, "Money makes money;" a man who has capital finds various means of increasing it; it grows as it is judiciously employed. Thus the grace of God, duly stirred up and exercised, receives continual accession, "grace for grace" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16</a>). The Christian's spiritual forces are developed by being properly directed; Providence puts in his way added opportunities, and as he uses these he is more and more strengthened and replenished. <span class="cmt_word">From him that hath not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). So the Received Text, probably from <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-26.htm">Luke 19:26</a>; the best manuscripts and editions read, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">but as to him that hath nat</span>; this, followed by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> at the end of the verse, is less tautological than the other reading. To "have not," in accordance with the context, signifies to possess nothing of any consequence, to be comparatively destitute, in the world's estimate of riches. Shall be taken away even that which he hath; <span class="accented">even that which he hath shall be taken away from him.</span> The Vulgate, following some few manuscripts, has, <span class="accented">Et quod videtur habere auferetur ab eo</span>, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-18.htm">Luke 8:18</a>. The poor unpractical man shall lose even the little which he possessed. So the spiritually unprofitable shall be punished by utter deprivation of the grace which was given for his advancement in holiness. If applied to the special circumstances of the time and of the persons to whom it was addressed, the parable would teach that the disciples who recognized and duly employed the riches of the doctrine and powers delivered unto them would receive further revelations; but that the people who spurned the offered salvation and neglected the gracious opportunity would forfeit the blessing, and be condemned. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:14-30 Christ keeps no servants to be idle: they have received their all from him, and have nothing they can call their own but sin. Our receiving from Christ is in order to our working for him. The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. The day of account comes at last. We must all be reckoned with as to what good we have got to our own souls, and have done to others, by the advantages we have enjoyed. It is not meant that the improving of natural powers can entitle a man to Divine grace. It is the real Christian's liberty and privilege to be employed as his Redeemer's servant, in promoting his glory, and the good of his people: the love of Christ constrains him to live no longer to himself, but to Him that died for him, and rose again. Those who think it impossible to please God, and in vain to serve him, will do nothing to purpose in religion. They complain that He requires of them more than they are capable of, and punishes them for what they cannot help. Whatever they may pretend, the fact is, they dislike the character and work of the Lord. The slothful servant is sentenced to be deprived of his talent. This may be applied to the blessings of this life; but rather to the means of grace. Those who know not the day of their visitation, shall have the things that belong to their peace hid from their eyes. His doom is, to be cast into outer darkness. It is a usual way of expressing the miseries of the damned in hell. Here, as in what was said to the faithful servants, our Saviour goes out of the parable into the thing intended by it, and this serves as a key to the whole. Let us not envy sinners, or covet any of their perishing possessions.</body></html>
