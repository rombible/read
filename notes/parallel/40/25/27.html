These were the bankers referred to in the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-14.htm" title="For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered to them his goods.">Matthew 25:14</a>. In that case, if the servant had been honestly conscious of his own want of power, there would have been at least some interest allowed on the deposit.<p><span class= "bld">Usury.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">interest;</span> the word not necessarily implying, as usury does now, anything illegal or exorbitant. The question--What answers to this "giving to the exchangers" in the interpretation of the parable?--is, as has been said, analogous to that which asks the meaning of "them that sell" in the answer of the wise virgins in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-9.htm" title="But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go you rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.">Matthew 25:9</a>. Whatever machinery or organisation the Church possesses for utilising opportunities which individual men fail to exercise, may be thought of as analogous to the banking-system of the old world. When men in the middle ages gave to a cathedral or a college, when they subscribe largely now to hospitals or missions, doing this and nothing more, they are "giving their money to the exchangers." It is not so acceptable an offering as willing and active service, but if it be honestly and humbly given, the giver will not lose his reward.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou oughtest therefore,</span> etc. Your conception of my character ought to have made you more diligent and scrupulous; and if you were really afraid to rust any risks with my money or invest it in any hazardous speculation, there were many ordinary and safe methods of employing it which would have yielded some profit, and some of these you would have adopted had you been faithful and earnest. The return might have been trifling in amount, but the lord shows that he is not grasping and harsh by being willing to accept even this in token of the servant's labour. <span class="cmt_word">To have put</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>). The term means to have thrown the money, as it were, on the banker's table. This would have been less trouble than digging a hole to bury it. <span class="cmt_word">Exchangers</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b6;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">numulariis</span>; <span class="accented">bankers.</span> In St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-23.htm">Luke 19:23</a>) we find <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, with the same meaning. These money changers or bankers (for the business seems always to have combined the two branches) were a numerous class in Palestine, and wherever the Jewish community was established. They received deposits at interest, and engaged in transactions such as are usual in modern times. <span class="cmt_word">With usury</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x1ff3;</span>, <span class="accented">with interest</span>). At one time, law had forbidden usurious transactions between Israelites, though the Gentile was left to the mercy of his creditor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-19.htm">Deuteronomy 23:19, 20</a>); but later such limitations were not observed. The rate of interest varied from four to forty per cent. The spiritual interpretation of this feature of the parable has most unnecessarily exercised the ingenuity of commentators. Some see in the bankers an adumbration of the religious societies and charitable institutions, by means of which persons can indirectly do some work for Christ, though unable personally to undertake such enterprises. Olshausen and Trench regard them as the stronger characters who, by example and guidance, lead the timid and hesitating to employ their gifts aright. But it is more reasonable to consider this detail of the parable as supplementary to its chief purpose, and not to be pressed in the interpretation. The Lord is simply concerned to show that all talents, great or small, must be used in his service according to opportunities; and that, whether the return be large or little, it is equally acceptable, if it show a willing mind and real fidelity in the agent. In illustration he uses two cases which yield most profit, and one which produces the least. Nothing can he inferred hence concerning the morality of usury. Christ draws his picture from the world as he finds it, pronouncing no opinion on its ethical bearing. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:14-30 Christ keeps no servants to be idle: they have received their all from him, and have nothing they can call their own but sin. Our receiving from Christ is in order to our working for him. The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. The day of account comes at last. We must all be reckoned with as to what good we have got to our own souls, and have done to others, by the advantages we have enjoyed. It is not meant that the improving of natural powers can entitle a man to Divine grace. It is the real Christian's liberty and privilege to be employed as his Redeemer's servant, in promoting his glory, and the good of his people: the love of Christ constrains him to live no longer to himself, but to Him that died for him, and rose again. Those who think it impossible to please God, and in vain to serve him, will do nothing to purpose in religion. They complain that He requires of them more than they are capable of, and punishes them for what they cannot help. Whatever they may pretend, the fact is, they dislike the character and work of the Lord. The slothful servant is sentenced to be deprived of his talent. This may be applied to the blessings of this life; but rather to the means of grace. Those who know not the day of their visitation, shall have the things that belong to their peace hid from their eyes. His doom is, to be cast into outer darkness. It is a usual way of expressing the miseries of the damned in hell. Here, as in what was said to the faithful servants, our Saviour goes out of the parable into the thing intended by it, and this serves as a key to the whole. Let us not envy sinners, or covet any of their perishing possessions.</body></html>
