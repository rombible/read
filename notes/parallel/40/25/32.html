The word, thus taken, serves as the key to the distinctive teaching that follows. We have had in this chapter, (1) in the Wise and Foolish Virgins, the law of judgment for all members of the Church of Christ; (2) in the Talents, that for all who hold any office or ministry in the Church: now we have (3) the law by which those shall be judged who have lived and died as heathens, not knowing the name of Christ, and knowing God only as revealed in Nature or in the law written in their hearts. Every stage in what follows confirms this interpretation.<p><span class= "bld">As a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats.</span>--Elsewhere the shepherd's work is the symbol of protective, self-sacrificing love, and, as such, our Lord had emphatically claimed for Himself the title of the Good Shepherd (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-14.htm" title="I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.">John 10:14</a>). Here we are reminded that even the shepherd has at times to execute the sentence of judgment which involves separation. The "right" hand and the "left" are used, according to the laws of what we might almost call a natural symbolism, as indicating respectively good and evil, acceptance and rejection.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall be gathered</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>). The angels shall gather them, the dead being first raised to life. <span class="cmt_word">All</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span>, <span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>nations</span>. Not the heathen only, but all mankind (see preliminary note). The criteria upon which the judgment proceeds, in the following verses, seem to imply that all men have the opportunity of receiving or rejecting the gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-10.htm">Mark 13:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-32.htm">Romans 11:32</a>). How this can apply to those who died before the incarnation of Christ and the consequent evangelization of the world, we know not, though we may believe that, ere the end comes, Christ will have been preached in every quarter of the globe. That some process of enlightenment goes on in the unseen world we learn from the mysterious passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18-20</a>; but we have no reason to suppose that probation is extended to the other life, or that souls will there have the offer of accepting or repelling the claims of Jesus (but see <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-6.htm">1 Peter 4:6</a>). By describing mankind as "all the nations," Christ shows the minute particularity of the judgment, which will enter into distinctions of country, race, etc., and while it is universal will be strictly impartial. He is the Shepherd of all mankind, whether considered as sheep or goats, and can therefore distinguish and class them perfectly. Those who have never heard of Christ (if such there shall be) can be tried only by the standard of natural religion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall separate them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>). Individuals of all the nations. Hitherto good and bad had been mingled together, often indistinguishable by man's eye or judgment; now an eternal distinction is made by an unerring hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-49.htm">Matthew 13:49</a>). The ideals already found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-17.htm">Ezekiel 34:17</a>, "Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats." <span class="cmt_word">As a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats.</span> The flocks of sheep and goats generally keep together during the day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-33.htm">Genesis 30:33</a>), but are separated at night or when being driven. The Syrian goat is usually black. The Lord delights in employing simple pastoral illustrations in his teaching. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:31-46 This is a description of the last judgment. It is as an explanation of the former parables. There is a judgment to come, in which every man shall be sentenced to a state of everlasting happiness, or misery. Christ shall come, not only in the glory of his Father, but in his own glory, as Mediator. The wicked and godly here dwell together, in the same cities, churches, families, and are not always to be known the one from the other; such are the weaknesses of saints, such the hypocrisies of sinners; and death takes both: but in that day they will be parted for ever. Jesus Christ is the great Shepherd; he will shortly distinguish between those that are his, and those that are not. All other distinctions will be done away; but the great one between saints and sinners, holy and unholy, will remain for ever. The happiness the saints shall possess is very great. It is a kingdom; the most valuable possession on earth; yet this is but a faint resemblance of the blessed state of the saints in heaven. It is a kingdom prepared. The Father provided it for them in the greatness of his wisdom and power; the Son purchased it for them; and the blessed Spirit, in preparing them for the kingdom, is preparing it for them. It is prepared for them: it is in all points adapted to the new nature of a sanctified soul. It is prepared from the foundation of the world. This happiness was for the saints, and they for it, from all eternity. They shall come and inherit it. What we inherit is not got by ourselves. It is God that makes heirs of heaven. We are not to suppose that acts of bounty will entitle to eternal happiness. Good works done for God's sake, through Jesus Christ, are here noticed as marking the character of believers made holy by the Spirit of Christ, and as the effects of grace bestowed on those who do them. The wicked in this world were often called to come to Christ for life and rest, but they turned from his calls; and justly are those bid to depart from Christ, that would not come to him. Condemned sinners will in vain offer excuses. The punishment of the wicked will be an everlasting punishment; their state cannot be altered. Thus life and death, good and evil, the blessing and the curse, are set before us, that we may choose our way, and as our way so shall our end be.</body></html>
