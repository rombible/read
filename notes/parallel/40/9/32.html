Referring to the Note in the <span class= "ital">Excursus</span> on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-28.htm" title="And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.">Matthew 8:28</a> for the general question as to "possession," it may be noted here that the phenomena presented in this case were those of catalepsy, or of insanity showing itself in obstinate and sullen silence. The dumbness was a spiritual disease, not the result of congenital malformation. The work of healing restored the man to sanity rather than removed a bodily imperfection. Comp. the analogous phenomena in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-22.htm" title="Then was brought to him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw.">Matthew 12:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-14.htm" title="And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spoke; and the people wondered.">Luke 11:14</a>. The latter agrees so closely with this that but for the fact of St. Matthew's connecting our Lord's answer to the accusation of the Pharisees with the second of these miracles, we might have supposed the two identical.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 32-34.</span> <span class="accented">- The demon cast out of the dumb man. The astonishment of the multitudes and their confession.</span> [<span class="accented">The accusation by the Pharisees.</span>] The whole narrative greatly resembles the cure of the blind and dumb man possessed with a devil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-22.htm">Matthew 12:22-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-14.htm">Luke 11:14, 15</a>), as may be seen from the fact that the following words are common to both passages, the brackets indicating a want of exact correspondence in the original. "They brought to him one possessed with a devil, dumb, and the [dumb spake]. And the multitudes [said.]... But the Pharisees, He casteth out the devils by... the prince of the devils." One explanation is that the two narratives are taken kern different sources, but represent the same incident; another, that as in vers. 27-31, so also here, the narratives of two similar incidents have become assimilated. At any rate, in the case of ver. 34 there has probably been assimilation, and that since the writing of the Gospel. For: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Ver. 34 is wanting in D, the Old Latin manuscripts <span class="accented">a</span> and <span class="accented">k</span>, Hilary and Juvencns, and is therefore rightly bracketed by Westcott and Hort as perhaps "<span class="accented">a</span> Western non-interpolation" (2. &sect; 240). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The verse seems to be hardly in complete accordance with the aim of the whole section, which ends much more suitably with the effect on the multitudes. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24</a> the verse forms a climax (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-2.htm">Matthew 12:2, 10, 14</a>). But here there has been no opposition mentioned since the very beginning of the chapter (for the disobedience of the blind men cannot be so called), so that the monstrous accusation comes in quite unexpectedly. Observe that this is not a case in which subjective difficulties are in themselves a <span class="accented">prima facie</span> argument for the genuineness of a phrase, for the early copyists troubled themselves very little about questions of the internal arrangement and the general aim of the sections. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> <span class="accented">-</span> (<span class="accented">And</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">as they went out</span> (<span class="accented">forth</span>, Revised Version; ver. 31). They were still on the threshold (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Behold, they brought to him</span>. The rendering of the Revised Version, "<span class="accented">there</span> was brought to him," is awkward, but avoids the implication that the blind men brought him this fresh case. <span class="cmt_word">A dumb man possessed with a devil</span>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-22.htm">Matthew 12:22</a> the man was blind also. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:32-34 Of the two, better a dumb devil than a blaspheming one. Christ's cures strike at the root, and remove the effect by taking away the cause; they open the lips, by breaking Satan's power in the soul. Nothing can convince those who are under the power of pride. They will believe anything, however false or absurd, rather than the Holy Scriptures; thus they show the enmity of their hearts against a holy God.</body></html>
