(2) That the court-yard was crowded, so that even the gateway leading into the street was filled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-2.htm" title="And straightway many were gathered together, so that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word to them.">Mark 2:2</a>). (3) That among the hearers were Pharisees and Doctors of the Law, who had come, not only from "every village of Galilee and Judaea," but also "from Jerusalem." The last fact is important as one of the few traces in the first three Gospels of an unrecorded ministry in Jerusalem, and, as will be seen, throws light on much that follows. They had apparently come to see how the new Teacher, who had so startled them at Jerusalem, was carrying on His work in Galilee, and, as far as they could, to hinder it. (4) That "the power of the Lord was present to heal them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-17.htm" title="And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.">Luke 5:17</a>), <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> that as He taught, the sick were brought to Him, and, either by word or touch, were cured.<p><span class= "bld">A man sick of the palsy.</span>--St. Matthew and St. Mark use the popular term "paralytic;" St. Luke, with perhaps more technical precision, the participle of the verb, "who was paralysed." The man was borne on a couch (St. Mark uses the Greek form of the Latin <span class= "ital">grabatum,</span> the bed or mattress of the poor) carried by four bearers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-3.htm" title="And they come to him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.">Mark 2:3</a>). They sought to bring him through the door, but were hindered by the crowd; and then going outside the house, they got upon the roof, removed part of the roof (the light structure of Eastern houses made the work comparatively easy), let him down with ropes through the opening into the midst of the crowd, just in front of the Teacher (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-4.htm" title="And when they could not come near to him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.">Mark 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-19.htm" title="And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went on the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the middle before Jesus.">Luke 5:19</a>). This persistency implied faith in His power to heal on the part both of the sick man and the bearers.<p><span class= "bld">Son, be of good cheer.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">child.</span> The word implies, perhaps (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-48.htm" title="And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said to him, Son, why have you thus dealt with us? behold, your father and I have sought you sorrowing.">Luke 2:48</a>), comparative youth, or, it may be, a fatherly tone of love and pity on the part of the speaker. Here, as elsewhere, pity is the starting-point of our Lord's work of healing, and He looked with infinite tenderness on the dejected expression of the sufferer, who had lost heart and hope.<p><span class= "bld">Thy sins be forgiven thee.</span>--The English is to modern ears ambiguous, and suggests the thought of a prayer or wish. The Greek is, however, either the present or the perfect passive of the indicative, "Thy sins are" or "have been forgiven thee." The words were addressed, we must believe, to the secret yearnings of the sufferer. Sickness had made him conscious of the burden of his sins, perhaps had come (as such forms of nervous exhaustion often do come) as the direct consequence of his sin. The Healer saw that the disease of the soul must first be removed, and that then would come the time for restoring strength to the body.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, they brought to him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>). Bengel's remark, "<span class="accented">Offerebant -</span> Tales oblationes factae sunt Salvatori plurimae, gratae," though very beautiful, is, from its undue insistence on the sacrificial use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span>, hardly exegesis. Matthew omits the difficulty that was experienced in bringing him to our Lord (see parallel passages), yet this alone accounts for the special commendation of their faith. <span class="cmt_word">A man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed.</span> Probably a mat or quilt (ver. 6). Professor Marshall, in the <span class="accented">Expositor</span> for March, 1891, p. 215, has a most interesting note showing that the differences between "lying on a bed" (Matthew)and "carried by four" (Mark), and even "they sought to bring him in, and to place him before him" (Luke, who has already mentioned "on a bed" ), may be explained by being different translations of an original Aramaic sentence. <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus seeing their faith</span>. Including that of the paralytic, who, as we may gather from the obedience he afterwards shows, had agreed to and had encouraged the special efforts of his bearers. <span class="cmt_word">Said unto the sick of the palsy; Son,</span> <span class="cmt_word">be of good cheer</span> (<span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="accented">Son.</span> So Mark, but Luke has "man" (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;</span>), which, though more usual in Greek (though still Hebraic, for <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;</span> would have been in accordance with classical usage), is much more colourless. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, as a term of address, is elsewhere in the New Testament used only where there is relationship physical (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-28.htm">Matthew 21:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-48.htm">Luke 2:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-31.htm">Luke 15:31</a>; even Luke 16:25) or moral, especially that of pupil and teacher (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-24.htm">Mark 10:24</a>; cf <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-18.htm">1 Timothy 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-1.htm">2 Timothy 2:1</a>). It therefore implies that there is both sympathy and much common ground between the speaker and him whom he addresses. It is the antithesis of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-29.htm">Matthew 8:29</a> (cf. further, <span class="accented">infra</span>, ver. 22). Thus it here served affectionately to encourage the sufferer in soul and body, preparing him to receive the announcement following. Matthew emphasizes its purpose by prefixing <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Thy sins be</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">are</span>; expressing clearly that the words are the statement of a fact, not merely the expression of a command. <span class="cmt_word">Forgiven thee</span>; Revised Version omits "thee" (genuine in Luke), with <span class="accented">manuscripts</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). Matthew and Mark use the present of general statement, Luke the perfect (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, Doric; Winer, 14:3. a), to express a past fact of permanent significance. Observe the order of the Lord's assurance, as recorded in the true text. Courage, sympathy, forgiveness, and, only after all else, recalling individual sins. As the assurance of forgiveness is delightful to the soul, so is it often helpful to the body. Hence possibly our Lord's method in this case, for the man "inter spem metumque dubius pendebat" (Wetstein). Compare for the conjunction of the two, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-15.htm">James 5:15</a>, and, as a still closer parallel to our passage, Talm. Bab., 'Nedarim,' 41<span class="accented">a</span>. "R. Hija bar Abba said, The sick doth not recover from his sickness until all his sins be forgiven him, for it is said, 'Who pardoneth all thy iniquities, who healeth all thy diseases.'" So also Qimbi (on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-5.htm">Psalm 41:5</a>, "Heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee" ): "He does not say, Heal my body," for it is his sins that are the cause of his sickness, but if God heal his soul from its sickness, viz. by making atonement for his sins, then his body is healed." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-8 The faith of the friends of the paralytic in bringing him to Christ, was a strong faith; they firmly believed that Jesus Christ both could and would heal him. A strong faith regards no obstacles in pressing after Christ. It was a humble faith; they brought him to attend on Christ. It was an active faith. Sin may be pardoned, yet the sickness not be removed; the sickness may be removed, yet the sin not pardoned: but if we have the comfort of peace with God, with the comfort of recovery from sickness, this makes the healing a mercy indeed. This is no encouragement to sin. If thou bring thy sins to Jesus Christ, as thy malady and misery to be cured of, and delivered from, it is well; but to come with them, as thy darlings and delight, thinking still to retain them and receive him, is a gross mistake, a miserable delusion. The great intention of the blessed Jesus in the redemption he wrought, is to separate our hearts from sin. Our Lord Jesus has perfect knowledge of all that we say within ourselves. There is a great deal of evil in sinful thoughts, which is very offensive to the Lord Jesus. Christ designed to show that his great errand to the world was, to save his people from their sins. He turned from disputing with the scribes, and spake healing to the sick man. Not only he had no more need to be carried upon his bed, but he had strength to carry it. God must be glorified in all the power that is given to do good.</body></html>
