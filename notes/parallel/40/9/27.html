(For the connexion, <span class="accented">vide ver.</span> 18, note.) Weiss (see Rushbrooke, p. 75, A; and 'Life,' 3:221) compares the incident at Jericho, ch. 20:29-34 (parallel passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-46.htm">Mark 10:46-52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-35.htm">Luke 18:35-43</a>). The points of <span class="accented">similarity</span> are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The number, two, but in the parallel passages only one; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the expression that Jesus was <span class="accented">passing by</span> (ver. 27; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-30.htm">Matthew 20:30</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> they cry out and say, "Have mercy on us, O Son of David;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> our Lord, in his question, asks about what he should <span class="accented">do</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> lays stress on their faith (Mark and Luke); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> and touches their eyes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-34.htm">Matthew 20:34</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The points of <span class="accented">difference</span>: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The place, here in Galilee, there by Jericho; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> here in the house, there in the road, but even here they begin to address him in the road; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> no mention here that he stopped when addressed, as there (ch. 20:32); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> our Lord here asks about their faith, there about their wish. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> Observe also that both his charge, "See that no man know it" (ver. 30), and the statement that they spread abroad the fame of him, would be quite inconsistent with the late date of the miracle recorded in ch. 20. From a consideration of these details, the conclusion seems inevitable that we have, in fact, narratives of two distinct occurrences, but it is quite consistent with tiffs conclusion to suppose that during the oral transmission of the narratives a certain amount of assimilation took place. Upon this supposition, it further appears probable that, as the narrative in ch. 20. was the better known, for it was in the Petrine cycle, our narrative became assimilated to it rather than the reverse. On the other hand, the number recorded in ch. 20. (not Mark or Luke) looks much like an assimilation to that of our incident (cf. the notes on the section <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-28.htm">Matthew 8:28-34</a>, ver. 31, and the section vers. 32-34). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span>- <span class="cmt_word">And when</span> <span class="cmt_word">Jesus departed thence.</span> As he was passing along on his way <span class="accented">thence</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the house of Jairus, if the context be pressed. It should be noticed that "thence" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) is found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-1.htm">Mark 6:1</a>, immediately after the healing of Jairus' daughter. There it refers to the neighbourhood generally. Possibly its presence in Matthew is ultimately due to his remembering it in the next succeeding section of the oral framework. <span class="cmt_word">Two blind men followed him, crying</span> (<span class="accented">out</span>, Revised Version; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, so also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-30.htm">Matthew 20:30</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and saying, Thou Son of David, have mercy on us.</span> The Revised Version rightly reverses the order of the two last clauses; the stress is on their own needs, not on their faith in giving him such a title. The words are identical in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-30.htm">Matthew 20:30</a>. <span class="accented">Thou Son of David.</span> The thought has been brought out in the genealogy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-17.htm">Matthew 1:17</a>), and our Lord lays stress upon it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-42.htm">Matthew 22:42</a>, <span class="accented">sqq.</span> Observe that although the excited multitudes at Jerusalem shout out the title at the triumphal entry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>; cf. also 15), yet the multitudes in Galilee only suggest the possibility of his having a right to it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-23.htm">Matthew 12:23</a>), and the only persons who use it when directly addressing him are a heathen woman (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-22.htm">Matthew 15:22</a>), and three, or perhaps four, blind men (here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-30.htm">Matthew 20:30, 31</a>). With the remembrance of what was promised to take place in Messianic days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>), the blind would be especially likely to accord him a Messianic title (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-5.htm">Matthew 11:5</a>, note). <span class="accented">Have mercy</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>, note). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:27-31 At this time the Jews expected Messiah would appear; these blind men knew and proclaimed in the streets of Capernaum that he was come, and that Jesus was he. Those who, by the providence of God, have lost their bodily sight, may, by the grace of God, have the eyes of their understanding fully enlightened. And whatever our wants and burdens are, we need no more for supply and support, than to share in the mercy of our Lord Jesus. In Christ is enough for all. They followed him crying aloud. He would try their faith, and would teach us always to pray, and not to faint, though the answer does not come at once. They followed Christ, and followed him crying; but the great question is, Do ye believe? Nature may make us earnest, but it is only grace that can work faith. Christ touched their eyes. He gives sight to blind souls by the power of his grace going with his word, and he puts the cure upon their faith. Those who apply to Jesus Christ, shall be dealt with, not according to their fancies, nor according to their profession, but according to their faith. Christ sometimes concealed his miracles, because he would not indulge the conceit which prevailed among the Jews, that their Messiah should be a temporal prince, and so give occasion to the people to attempt tumults and seditions.</body></html>
