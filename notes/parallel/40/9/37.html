It is not enough for Him to feel compassion Himself. He craves the sympathy of His companions and disciples, and needs even their fellowship in prayer. A great want lies before Him, and He sees that they are the right agents to meet it, if only they will pray to be made so; or, to put the case more clearly, if only they will pray that the work <span class= "ital">may be done,</span> whether they themselves are or are not the doers of it.<p><span class= "bld">The harvest truly is plenteous.</span>--This is the first occurrence in the record of the first three Gospels of the figure which was afterwards to be expanded in the two parables of the Sower and the Tares, and to reappear in the visions of the Apocalypse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/14-14.htm" title="And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and on the cloud one sat like to the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.">Revelation 14:14-19</a>). We find, however, from the Gospel of St. John--which here, as so often elsewhere, supplies missing links and the germs of thoughts afterwards developed--that it was not a new similitude in our Lord's teaching. Once before, among the alien Samaritans, He had seen the fields white as for the spiritual harvest of the souls of men, and had spoken of him that soweth and him that reapeth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/4-35.htm" title="Say not you, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.">John 4:35-36</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 37, 38.</span> - The utterance is given word for word (except one transposition) at the beginning of the address to the seventy in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-2.htm">Luke 10:2</a>. But while serving there as an introduction to the rest of the speech, the reason for it is so much more self-evident here that St. Matthew seems to have recorded it in its original connexion. Our Lord himself, feeling the shepherdless condition of the people, desires to call out the interest of his disciples in it. He wants them to realize both the need of the people and the possibility that lay before the workmen. Changing the metaphor, he bids them pray him, who alone has the right and power, to send more workmen to reap these fields. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest</span> - of human souls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35-38</a>). Truly. So also the Revised Version; too strong a rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Is</span> <span class="cmt_word">plenteous</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-23.htm">Matthew 10:23</a>; Bengel), <span class="cmt_word">but the labourers are few</span>. Who besides himself? John the Baptist, some who had been healed, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the Gadarene demoniac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-20.htm">Mark 5:20</a>, possibly also the blind men of ver. 31), and perhaps a few unknown true believers. Not the twelve, for these are evidently distinguished, and only to be included under the labourers spoken of in the end of the next verse. If, however, the utterance was originally spoken to the seventy (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>), the reference would be to the twelve. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:35-38 Jesus visited not only the great and wealthy cities, but the poor, obscure villages; and there he preached, there he healed. The souls of the meanest in the world are as precious to Christ, and should be so to us, as the souls of those who make the greatest figure. There were priests, Levites, and scribes, all over the land; but they were idol shepherds, Zec 11:17; therefore Christ had compassion on the people as sheep scattered, as men perishing for lack of knowledge. To this day vast multitudes are as sheep not having a shepherd, and we should have compassion and do all we can to help them. The multitudes desirous of spiritual instruction formed a plenteous harvest, needing many active labourers; but few deserved that character. Christ is the Lord of the harvest. Let us pray that many may be raised up and sent forth, who will labour in bringing souls to Christ. It is a sign that God is about to bestow some special mercy upon a people, when he stirs them up to pray for it. And commissions given to labourers in answer to prayer, are most likely to be successful.</body></html>
