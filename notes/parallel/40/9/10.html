What seems to have been meant is, that while Matthew sat (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> reclined after Roman fashion), many publicans and sinners came and reclined with Jesus and His disciples. On the assumption of St. Matthew's authorship of the Gospel, there is a noticeable humility in his omission of the fact that he had made "a great feast" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-29.htm" title="And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.">Luke 5:29</a>). It was apparently a farewell feast to old friends and neighbours before he entered on his new calling. They were naturally mostly of his own class, or on a yet lower level. The publican was the pariah of Palestine, and no decent person would associate with him. The term "sinners" may have included Gentiles, but does not necessarily designate them. So far as the context goes, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-13.htm" title="But go you and learn what that means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.">Matthew 9:13</a>, the term is used in its simple and natural sense.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-13.</span> <span class="accented">- The feast with publicans and sinners</span>, <span class="accented">and Christ's apology.</span> Parallel passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-15.htm">Mark 2:15-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-29.htm">Luke 5:29-32</a>. All three evangelists give the essential features of the section, but Mark and Luke show more clearly that the feast was in the house of the new disciple, and Matthew alone gives the reference to Hosea. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it</span> <span class="cmt_word">came to pass, as Jesus</span> (<span class="accented">he</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">sat at meat;</span> "Gr. <span class="accented">reclined</span>: and so always" (Revised Version margin); cf. ch. 26:20. <span class="cmt_word">In the house;</span> Luke, "And Levi made him a great feast in his house." Whether or not this was the same as the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, we have no means of knowing, but presumably it was not. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, many publicans</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-46.htm">Matthew 5:46</a>, note) <span class="cmt_word">and sinners</span>. The second term seems to include all who openly impugned or neglected the Law. It is, therefore, sometimes used with special reference to Gentiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-45.htm">Matthew 26:45</a>; cf <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-15.htm">Galatians 2:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Came and sat down with him</span> (Revised Version, <span class="accented">Jesus</span>, emphatic) <span class="cmt_word">and his disciples.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:10-13 Some time after his call, Matthew sought to bring his old associates to hear Christ. He knew by experience what the grace of Christ could do, and would not despair concerning them. Those who are effectually brought to Christ, cannot but desire that others also may be brought to him. Those who suppose their souls to be without disease will not welcome the spiritual Physician. This was the case with the Pharisees; they despised Christ, because they thought themselves whole; but the poor publicans and sinners felt that they wanted instruction and amendment. It is easy, and too common, to put the worst constructions upon the best words and actions. It may justly be suspected that those have not the grace of God themselves, who are not pleased with others' obtaining it. Christ's conversing with sinners is here called mercy; for to promote the conversion of souls is the greatest act of mercy. The gospel call is a call to repentance; a call to us to change our minds, and to change our ways. If the children of men had not been sinners, there had been no need for Christ to come among them. Let us examine whether we have found out our sickness, and have learned to follow the directions of our great Physician.</body></html>
