It is manifestly the beginning of the section which contains the great discourse of Matthew 10, and was intended to lead up to it.<p><span class= "bld">Every sickness and every disease</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> every variety or type, rather than every individual case. The work of healing was, we must believe, dependent, as before, on the faith of those who came seeking to be healed. Of the two words, the former is in the Greek the stronger, and, though the relative significance of the English words is not sharply defined, it would, perhaps, be better to invert the renderings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - Parallel passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-6.htm">Mark 6:6</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-22.htm">Luke 13:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus went about all the cities and</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">villages</span>. The Revised Version rightly restricts the "all" to the cities (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). It would have been impossible to visit all the villages. A village was distinguished from a city by being <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> unwalled (though occasionally towns were themselves unwalled); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> dependent on the cities (cf. Schurer, II. 1. p. 154, <span class="accented">seq.</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Teaching</span>, etc. From this point the verse is identical with <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a> (where see notes), except that the end of that verse, "among the people," is not found in the true text of our passage, but has been inserted thence. Its omission here and the alteration of the words," in all Galilee," to "all the cities and the villages," are both due to the wider scope of what follows. Observe that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a> our Lord's circuit is the occasion of crowds resorting to him, and serves as an introduction to a full account of his personal teaching, while here it is the occasion of his sending representatives, and serves as an introduction to his commission to them. As to the phrase, "healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness," notice that the recurrence of terminology (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-1.htm">Matthew 10:1</a>) falls in with the oral theory, especially in its catechetical form (cf. 'Introduction,' p. 9.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:35-38 Jesus visited not only the great and wealthy cities, but the poor, obscure villages; and there he preached, there he healed. The souls of the meanest in the world are as precious to Christ, and should be so to us, as the souls of those who make the greatest figure. There were priests, Levites, and scribes, all over the land; but they were idol shepherds, Zec 11:17; therefore Christ had compassion on the people as sheep scattered, as men perishing for lack of knowledge. To this day vast multitudes are as sheep not having a shepherd, and we should have compassion and do all we can to help them. The multitudes desirous of spiritual instruction formed a plenteous harvest, needing many active labourers; but few deserved that character. Christ is the Lord of the harvest. Let us pray that many may be raised up and sent forth, who will labour in bringing souls to Christ. It is a sign that God is about to bestow some special mercy upon a people, when he stirs them up to pray for it. And commissions given to labourers in answer to prayer, are most likely to be successful.</body></html>
