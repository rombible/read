And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, trouble not yourself: for I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof:">Luke 7:6</a>, and meaning literally "flayed," and thence figuratively "tormented, worried, vexed." They were not merely as sheep that have grown weary and faint, hungry, looking up and yet not fed, but were as those that have been harassed by the wolf--the prey of thieves and robbers. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/10-8.htm" title="All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.">John 10:8-12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But when he saw the multitudes</span>. The substance of this verse is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-34.htm">Mark 6:34</a> on the <span class="accented">return</span> of the apostles, equivalent to our <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span> (cf. <span class="accented">supra</span>). According to the context, <span class="accented">the multitudes</span> here spoken of are those of the various cities and villages through which he had passed. <span class="cmt_word">He was moved with compassion on</span> (<span class="accented">for</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). After the vivid Hebrew metaphor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-30.htm">Genesis 43:30</a>), which the LXX. seldom ventured to translate literally, but which is common in the New Testament writings. <span class="cmt_word">Because they fainted</span>. So the Received Text (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-32.htm">Matthew 15:32</a>), but the Revised Version, with manuscripts, "were distressed" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>, which in the classics is equivalent, to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "flay," <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "mangle," is found only in the sense of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "trouble or harass," in the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-35.htm">Mark 5:35</a> [parallel passage: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-49.htm">Luke 8:49</a>]; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-6.htm">Luke 7:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And were scattered abroad</span>; Revised Version simply, <span class="accented">and scattered.</span> (For the thought, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-5.htm">Ezekiel 34:5</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-16.htm">2 Chronicles 18:16</a>; and its parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-17.htm">1 Kings 22:17</a>.) The two participles express different aspects of their now normal and continuous state (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). Yet the Authorized Version margin, "and lay down," is probably nearer the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> here than the Authorized Version and Revised Version; cf. 1 Macc. 11:4 (" They showed him the temple of Dagon burnt... and the bodies cast out" ); <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-16.htm">Jeremiah 14:16</a> (" The people... shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem... and they shall have none to bury them" ), whine the thought is hardly "scattered," but "cast out and lying prostrate." So here the people are pictured as sheep harassed and prostrated by fatigue, etc.; cf. Vulgate, <span class="accented">vexati et jacentes. <span class="cmt_word"></span>As sheep having no shepherd</span>; <span class="accented">not having a shepherd</span> (Revised Version); cf. the Old Testament passages just referred to. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:35-38 Jesus visited not only the great and wealthy cities, but the poor, obscure villages; and there he preached, there he healed. The souls of the meanest in the world are as precious to Christ, and should be so to us, as the souls of those who make the greatest figure. There were priests, Levites, and scribes, all over the land; but they were idol shepherds, Zec 11:17; therefore Christ had compassion on the people as sheep scattered, as men perishing for lack of knowledge. To this day vast multitudes are as sheep not having a shepherd, and we should have compassion and do all we can to help them. The multitudes desirous of spiritual instruction formed a plenteous harvest, needing many active labourers; but few deserved that character. Christ is the Lord of the harvest. Let us pray that many may be raised up and sent forth, who will labour in bringing souls to Christ. It is a sign that God is about to bestow some special mercy upon a people, when he stirs them up to pray for it. And commissions given to labourers in answer to prayer, are most likely to be successful.</body></html>
