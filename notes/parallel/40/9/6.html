The two passages are so closely parallel that we can hardly be wrong in thinking that the words now spoken were meant to recall those which some, at least, of those who listened had heard before. This view, at any rate, brings out the fulness of their meaning. As they stand here, they seem to include both the two hypotheses mentioned in the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-3.htm" title="And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemes.">Matthew 9:3</a>. The Father had given Him authority to "forgive sins" and to "execute judgment" because He was the Son of Man, the representative of mankind, and as such was exercising a delegated power. But then, that discourse in John 5 showed that He also spoke of Himself as the Son of God as well as the Son of Man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-25.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.">John 5:25</a>), and as such claimed an honour equal to that which was rightly paid to the Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-23.htm" title="That all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honors not the Son honors not the Father which has sent him.">John 5:23</a>). Ultimately, therefore, our Lord's answer rests on the higher, and not the lower, of the two grounds on which the objectors might have been met.<p><span class= "bld">Arise, take up thy bed.</span>--As St. Mark gives the words we have the very syllables that had been spoken to the "impotent man" at Bethesda (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-8.htm" title="Jesus said to him, Rise, take up your bed, and walk.">John 5:8</a>), and in any case words identical in meaning; and the natural inference is that our Lord meant to recall what the scribes from Jerusalem had then seen and heard.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But that ye may know</span>. From his authority in the physical world they may have direct knowledge (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) of his authority in the spiritual world. Observe that the claim is even in the so-called "Triple Tradition." <span class="cmt_word">That the Son of man hath power</span> (better, <span class="accented">authority</span>, with Revised Version margin, and the American Committee) on earth to forgive sins (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). Observe <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that our Lord does not say "I," but "the Son of man" ; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the emphatic words in the sentence are "hath authority," and "on earth." It would therefore appear as though our Lord wished to call the attention of those present to a phrase which they already knew, but did not rightly understand. He seems to point them to <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>, and reminding them that even there "one like unto a son of man" (cf. <span class="accented">supra</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>, note) receives authority (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, ver. 14), tells them that this authority includes forgiving sins, and that this may be exercised not only in the future and in "the clouds of heaven," but now (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) and "on earth." Further, if, as seems likely,. the phrase was understood to symbolize the nation, he desired them to see in himself the great means whereby the nation should rise to its ideal. If, as is possible, though hardly probable, this saying of our Lord's is chronologically earlier than <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>, and there,-fore the earliest occasion on which he used the phrase, the almost direct reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a> makes it the more interesting. <span class="cmt_word">(Then saith he to the sick of the palsy). </span> The thought of the sentence is continued, but as he now turns directly to the sick man, its form is altered. <span class="cmt_word">Arise, take up</span>. The Revised Version, retaining the wrong reading, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>, inserts "and." <span class="cmt_word">Thy bed</span> (ver. 9, note), <span class="cmt_word">and go unto thine house</span>. Thus avoiding publicity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-8 The faith of the friends of the paralytic in bringing him to Christ, was a strong faith; they firmly believed that Jesus Christ both could and would heal him. A strong faith regards no obstacles in pressing after Christ. It was a humble faith; they brought him to attend on Christ. It was an active faith. Sin may be pardoned, yet the sickness not be removed; the sickness may be removed, yet the sin not pardoned: but if we have the comfort of peace with God, with the comfort of recovery from sickness, this makes the healing a mercy indeed. This is no encouragement to sin. If thou bring thy sins to Jesus Christ, as thy malady and misery to be cured of, and delivered from, it is well; but to come with them, as thy darlings and delight, thinking still to retain them and receive him, is a gross mistake, a miserable delusion. The great intention of the blessed Jesus in the redemption he wrought, is to separate our hearts from sin. Our Lord Jesus has perfect knowledge of all that we say within ourselves. There is a great deal of evil in sinful thoughts, which is very offensive to the Lord Jesus. Christ designed to show that his great errand to the world was, to save his people from their sins. He turned from disputing with the scribes, and spake healing to the sick man. Not only he had no more need to be carried upon his bed, but he had strength to carry it. God must be glorified in all the power that is given to do good.</body></html>
