It is as if our Lord saw the garrulous joy on the point of uttering itself, and sought by every means in His power to restrain it. The reasons may be sought, as elsewhere, either (1) in its being good for the spiritual life of the men themselves that they should show forth their praise of God, not with their lips, but in their lives; or (2) in the shrinking from mere notoriety, from the gaze of crowds drawn together to gaze on signs and wonders, and ready to make the Wonder-Worker a king because He wrought them, which St. Matthew, at a later stage, notes as characteristic of our Lord's ministry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-16.htm" title="And charged them that they should not make him known:">Matthew 12:16-21</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). The notion is of "coercion springing out of displeasure. The feeling is called out by something seen in another which moves to anger rather than to sorrow" (Bishop Westcott, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-33.htm">John 11:33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Saying, See that no man know it.</span> Partly to avoid publicity for himself, partly for their own sake, for even the recital of the Lord's mercies towards us often becomes an occasion of spiritual harm, since it is apt to degenerate into "display" with its attendant evils. <span class="greek">&#xa0;&#x1ffe;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> (Origen, in Cromer's 'Catena'). The other occasions (<span class="accented">vide</span> ch. 8:4, note) on which a similar command was given seem all to belong, with this, to the earlier part of his ministry. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:27-31 At this time the Jews expected Messiah would appear; these blind men knew and proclaimed in the streets of Capernaum that he was come, and that Jesus was he. Those who, by the providence of God, have lost their bodily sight, may, by the grace of God, have the eyes of their understanding fully enlightened. And whatever our wants and burdens are, we need no more for supply and support, than to share in the mercy of our Lord Jesus. In Christ is enough for all. They followed him crying aloud. He would try their faith, and would teach us always to pray, and not to faint, though the answer does not come at once. They followed Christ, and followed him crying; but the great question is, Do ye believe? Nature may make us earnest, but it is only grace that can work faith. Christ touched their eyes. He gives sight to blind souls by the power of his grace going with his word, and he puts the cure upon their faith. Those who apply to Jesus Christ, shall be dealt with, not according to their fancies, nor according to their profession, but according to their faith. Christ sometimes concealed his miracles, because he would not indulge the conceit which prevailed among the Jews, that their Messiah should be a temporal prince, and so give occasion to the people to attempt tumults and seditions.</body></html>
