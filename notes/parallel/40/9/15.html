He had pointed to Jesus as "the Bridegroom." He had taught them that the coming of that Bridegroom was the fulfilling of his joy. Would he have withdrawn from the outward expression of that joy?<p><span class= "bld">The children of the bridechamber</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the guests invited to the wedding. The words implied, startling as that thought would be to them, that the feast in Matthew's house was, in fact, a wedding-feast. His disciples were at once the guests of that feast individually; and collectively they were the new Israel, the new congregation or <span class= "ital">Ecclesia,</span> which was, as our Lord taught in parable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-2.htm" title="The kingdom of heaven is like to a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,">Matthew 22:2</a>), and St. Paul directly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/5-25.htm" title="Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>), and St. John in apocalyptic vision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-7.htm" title="Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready.">Revelation 19:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm" title="And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.">Revelation 21:2</a>), the bride whom He had come to make His own, to cleanse, and to purify.<p><span class= "bld">The days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them.</span>--Noteworthy as the first recorded intimation in our Lord's public teaching (that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-14.htm" title="And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:">John 3:14</a> was less clear until interpreted by the event, and was addressed to Nicodemus, and perhaps to him only, or, at the furthest, to St. John) of His coming death. The joy of the wedding-feast would cease, and then would come the long night of expectation, till once again there should be the cry, "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-6.htm" title="And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom comes; go you out to meet him.">Matthew 25:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Then shall they fast.</span>--The words can hardly be looked on as a command imposing fasting as a formal obligation, but, beyond all doubt, they sanction the principle on which fasting rests. The time that was to follow the departure of the Bridegroom would be one of sorrow, conflict, discipline, and at such a time the self-conquest implied in abstinence was the natural and true expression of the feelings that belonged to it. So the Christian Church has always felt; so it was, as the New Testament records, in the lives of at least two great apostles, St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-10.htm" title="And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,">Acts 10:10</a>) and St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-27.htm" title="In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.">2Corinthians 11:27</a>). So far as it goes, however, the principle here asserted is in favour of fasts at special seasons of sorrow rather than of frequent and fixed fasts as a discipline, or meritorious act. In fixing her days of fasting, the Church of England, partly guided perhaps by earlier usage, has at least connected them with the seasons and days that call specially to meditation on the sterner, sadder side of truth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus said unto them, Can.</span> It is a moral impossibility (ch. 6:24). <span class="cmt_word">The children</span> (sons, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">of the bride-chamber</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). Edersheim ('Life,' etc., 1:663) points out that these are not the <span class="accented">shoshbenim</span>, the friends of the bridegroom, who conducted the bride with music, etc., to the house of her parents-in-law, and to the bride-chamber, and who naturally remained to take part in the wedding feast; for <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the custom of having <span class="accented">shoshbenim</span> prevailed in Judaea, but not in Galilee; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Talm. Jeremiah, 'Succah,' &sect; 2:5, expressly distinguishes between the two terms: "Those who are <span class="accented">shoshbenim</span>, and all the sons of the bride-chamber, are free from the obligation of booths (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5e4;&#x5d8;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5db;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5db;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span>)." They appear to be those, invited by either party, who come to take part in the wedding festivities. They are, therefore, in full sympathy with bridegroom and bride, and, like them, cannot but rejoice. <span class="cmt_word">Mourn</span>; parallel passages, "fast," but Matthew's word, as less closely connected with the cause of the objection raised, seems the more original. <span class="cmt_word">As long as the bridegroom is with them?</span> Nosgen sees in this a claim to be the expected Bridegroom of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-1.htm">Jeremiah 3:1-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But the days will come</span>. Christ speaks with prophetic assurance of the coming of such a time (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). Observe his consciousness alike of his position and of what is coming upon him. <span class="cmt_word">When the bridegroom shall be taken</span> (<span class="accented">away</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">from them</span>. His removal shall be effected, not by his own action, but by external agents (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>). In these unsettled times, with their frequent though mostly unimportant popular risings, it cannot have been a very unusual thing for the bridegroom to be carried off, not indeed before the consummation of the marriage, but before the end of the week of festivities. <span class="cmt_word">And then shall</span> (<span class="accented">will</span>, Revised Version; there is no trace of a command, Christ is but stating a fact) <span class="cmt_word">they fast</span>. Christ here endorses the principle of Christian fasts (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-16.htm">Matthew 6:16</a>), but regards them as springing; not from any legal obligation, but flora personal grief, in this case at his absence (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-20.htm">John 16:20</a>). The only later passages in the New Testament where Christian fasting is mentioned, are <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-5.htm">2 Corinthians 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-27.htm">2 Corinthians 11:27</a>. In the 'Didache,' &sect; 8, we have the earliest formal recognition or' it as a practice. It is there forbidden to fast on the same days as the Pharisees. Observe that this verse was understood in Tertullian's time as expressly commanding a fast during the forty hours in which our Lord was in the grave ('De Jejun.,' &sect; 2), and that, from Irenseus's expression in Eusebius ('Ch. Hist.,' 5:24), this fast had been kept almost from apostolic times. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:14-17 John was at this time in prison; his circumstances, his character, and the nature of the message he was sent to deliver, led those who were peculiarly attached to him, to keep frequent fasts. Christ referred them to John's testimony of him, Joh 3:29. Though there is no doubt that Jesus and his disciples lived in a spare and frugal manner, it would be improper for his disciples to fast while they had the comfort of his presence. When he is with them, all is well. The presence of the sun makes day, and its absence produces night. Our Lord further reminded them of common rules of prudence. It was not usual to take a piece of rough woolen cloth, which had never been prepared, to join to an old garment, for it would not join well with the soft, old garment, but would tear it further, and the rent would be made worse. Nor would men put new wine into old leathern bottles, which were going to decay, and would be liable to burst from the fermenting of the wine; but putting the new wine into strong, new, skin bottles, both would be preserved. Great caution and prudence are necessary, that young converts may not receive gloomy and forbidding ideas of the service of our Lord; but duties are to be urged as they are able to bear them.</body></html>
