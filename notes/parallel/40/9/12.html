That, speaking from the thoughts and standpoint of those addressed (which in another than our Lord we might term grave irony), which enters so largely into our Lord's teaching, appears here in its most transparent form. Those of whom He speaks were, we know, suffering from the worst form of spiritual disease, but in their own estimation they were without spot or taint, and as such. therefore, He speaks to them. On their own showing, they ought not to object to His carrying on that work where there was most need of it. The proverb cited by Him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-23.htm" title="And he said to them, You will surely say to me this proverb, Physician, heal yourself: whatever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in your country.">Luke 4:23</a> shows that it was not the first time that He had referred to His own work as that of the Great Physician.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But when Jesus heard that,</span> <span class="cmt_word">he said unto them, They that be whole.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> (so also Mark) may include an <span class="accented">arriere-pensee</span> of moral <span class="accented">self-assertion</span> which St. Luke entirely loses by his alteration to <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-10.htm">1 Corinthians 4:10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Need not;</span> <span class="accented">have no need of</span> (Revised Version).

A physician, but they that are sick</span>. "Sed ubi dolores sunt, air, illic festinat medicns," Ephr. Syr., in his exposition of Tatian's 'Diatess.' (Resch, 'Agrapha,' p. 443). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:10-13 Some time after his call, Matthew sought to bring his old associates to hear Christ. He knew by experience what the grace of Christ could do, and would not despair concerning them. Those who are effectually brought to Christ, cannot but desire that others also may be brought to him. Those who suppose their souls to be without disease will not welcome the spiritual Physician. This was the case with the Pharisees; they despised Christ, because they thought themselves whole; but the poor publicans and sinners felt that they wanted instruction and amendment. It is easy, and too common, to put the worst constructions upon the best words and actions. It may justly be suspected that those have not the grace of God themselves, who are not pleased with others' obtaining it. Christ's conversing with sinners is here called mercy; for to promote the conversion of souls is the greatest act of mercy. The gospel call is a call to repentance; a call to us to change our minds, and to change our ways. If the children of men had not been sinners, there had been no need for Christ to come among them. Let us examine whether we have found out our sickness, and have learned to follow the directions of our great Physician.</body></html>
