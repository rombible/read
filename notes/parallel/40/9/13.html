To have withdrawn from contact with sinners would have been a formal "sacrifice," such as Pharisees delighted to offer, and from which they took their very name; but the claims or "mercy" were higher, and bade Him mingle with them. It was the very purpose of His coming, not to call "righteous men" (again with studied reference to their own estimate of themselves), but "sinners," and to call them, not to continue as they were, but, as St. Luke adds (the words are wanting in the best MSS. here and also in St. Mark), "to repentance." We may, perhaps, infer further, that when the scribes were told to consider what the prophet's words meant, there was also some reference to the context of those words. They would find their own likeness in the words, "Your goodness is as a morning cloud; . . . they . . . have transgressed the covenant; there have they dealt treacherously against me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-4.htm" title="O Ephraim, what shall I do to you?

But go ye and learn</span>. A common rabbinic phrase based on the fact that the disputants would not always have the cumbrous rolls of Scripture actually with them. These Pharisees pro-reseed to be students of Scripture, but had not yet learned the principle taught in this passage<span class="cmt_word">. What that meaneth, I will</span> <span class="cmt_word">have</span> (I <span class="accented">desire</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">mercy,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and not sacrifice</span>. <span class="accented">Mercy</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). In the original connexion of this quotation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>) the words are without doubt (but cf. Dr. Taylor's 'Gospel in the Law,' p. 10) an expression of God's desire that his people should show mercy rather than only perform external sacrifices, and this meaning is probably intended by our Lord here also. The connexion will then be either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "<span class="accented">I</span> wish you to show mercy rather than perform external actions, for only thus will you resemble me in my coming to call sinners;" or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "I wish you to show this mercy, and therefore I practise it myself." The former seems the more natural. It is, however, possible that our Lord disregards the original context of the words, and uses them only as a summary of an important truth, that God prefers to show mercy rather than to insist on sacrifice. This would make excellent sense here, viz. "Learn the true principle by which God acts, free grace, for it is on this that I have acted in coming to call sinners." (So nearly Dr. Taylor, op. c<span class="accented">it.</span>, p. 3.) The sentence is quoted again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-7.htm">Matthew 12:7</a>, where the original thought of the words seems more certainly applicable. <span class="cmt_word">For I</span> <span class="cmt_word">am not come;</span> <span class="accented">for I came not</span> (Revised Version). Christ refers to his historic coming in the Incarnation rather than to his abiding presence (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To call the righteous, but sinners</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>). The English generic article in the first term spoils the anarthrous expression of the Greek by lessening the contrast between the two classes. Dr. Taylor suggests the rendering, "not <span class="accented">saints</span>, <span class="accented">but sinners"</span> (<span class="accented">op. cit.</span>, p. 4). <span class="cmt_word">To repentance</span>. Omitted by the Revised Version and Westcott and Herr. From the parallel passage in Luke. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:10-13 Some time after his call, Matthew sought to bring his old associates to hear Christ. He knew by experience what the grace of Christ could do, and would not despair concerning them. Those who are effectually brought to Christ, cannot but desire that others also may be brought to him. Those who suppose their souls to be without disease will not welcome the spiritual Physician. This was the case with the Pharisees; they despised Christ, because they thought themselves whole; but the poor publicans and sinners felt that they wanted instruction and amendment. It is easy, and too common, to put the worst constructions upon the best words and actions. It may justly be suspected that those have not the grace of God themselves, who are not pleased with others' obtaining it. Christ's conversing with sinners is here called mercy; for to promote the conversion of souls is the greatest act of mercy. The gospel call is a call to repentance; a call to us to change our minds, and to change our ways. If the children of men had not been sinners, there had been no need for Christ to come among them. Let us examine whether we have found out our sickness, and have learned to follow the directions of our great Physician.</body></html>
