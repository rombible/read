And the sequence was probably, in part at least, one of cause and effect. The sympathy and power shown in healing the paralytic impressed itself on the mind of one who, as a publican, felt that he too had sins that needed to be forgiven.<p><span class= "bld">A man, named Matthew.</span>--St. Mark and St. Luke give the name as Levi, the former adds that he was the "son of Alphaeus." The difference may be explained by assuming that in his case, as in that of "Simon who is called (or named) Peter" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-2.htm" title="Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;">Matthew 10:2</a>), a new name was given that practically superseded the old. The meaning of Matthew--which, like Theodore, Dorotheus, and the like, means "the gift of God," or, more strictly, "the gift of Jehovah"--makes a change of this kind in itself probable. If he were the son of Alphaeus, he would be (assuming identity of person and of name) the brother of the James whose name appears with his own in the second group of four in the lists of the Twelve Apostles.<p><span class= "bld">Sitting at the receipt of custom.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">at the custom-house,</span> the <span class= "ital">douane</span> of the lake. The customs levied there were probably of the nature of an <span class= "ital">octroi</span> on the fish, fruit, and other produce that made up the exports and imports of Capernaum.<p><span class= "bld">And he saith unto him, Follow me.</span>--St. Mark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-13.htm" title="And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted to him, and he taught them.">Mark 2:13</a>) makes the call follow close upon an unrecorded discourse addressed to the whole multitude of Capernaum. In the nature of the case it was probable that there had been, as in the analogous call of the sons of Jona and Zebedee, a preparation of some kind. A brother had been converted, his own heart had been touched, he had felt (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-13.htm" title="And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelled in Capernaum, which is on the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:">Matthew 4:13</a>) the presence of the new Teacher as light in the shadow of death.<p><span class= "bld">He arose, and followed him.</span>--St. Luke adds, "he left all." There was not much to leave--his desk at the custom, his stipend or his percentage; but it was his all, and no man can leave more than that.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-17.</span> - 3.

Observe in this section the signs of opposition <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from the high-Judaic party, on a question of moral defilement (ver. 11); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from those who were professedly waiting for Messiah, on a question of ceremonial observance (ver. 14). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- The call of Matthew.</span> Parallel passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-13.htm">Mark 2:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-27.htm">Luke 5:27, 28</a>. All three evangelists connect this with the preceding miracle, but in the parallel passages the name is given as" Levi," St. Mark adding, "the <span class="accented">son</span> of Alphaeus." If the First Gospel were not written, in either Greek or Aramaic, by St. Matthew himself, but by a catechist of the Matthean cycle (<span class="accented">vide</span> Introduction, pp. 6, 17.), it is possible that "Levi," as found in the source, may have seemed to the catechist disrespectful, and that he altered it to the title by which he had been accustomed to hear his master called. If, on the other hand, and as seems more probable, this Gospel was written by St. Matthew, his preference for "Matthew" rather than "<span class="accented">Levi"</span> may be due to its meaning (<span class="accented">vide</span> Introduction, p. 21.). <span class="cmt_word">And as Jesus passed forth</span> (Revised Version, <span class="accented">by</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>from thence</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-13.htm">Mark 2:13</a> says that our Lord went out along the seaside, where "the receipt of custom" (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>) would naturally be. <span class="cmt_word">He saw a man, named</span> (Revised Version, <span class="accented">called</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Matthew</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> Introduction, p. 20.).

At the present day in Palestine" a booth of branches, or a more substantial hut, is erected at every entrance into the city or village, and there, both day and night, sits a man at ' the receipt of custom.' He taxes all the produce, piercing with a long, sharp iron rod the large camel-bags of wheat or cotton, in order to discover concealed copper wire, or other contraband" (Van Lennep, in Exell, <span class="accented">in lot.</span>). Schurer (1. 2. p, 67) shows that the customs raised at Capernaum in the time of Christ undoubtedly went, not into the imperial <span class="accented">fiscus</span>, but into the treasury of Herod Antipas. On the other band, in Judaea at that time the customs were raised in the interests of the imperial <span class="accented">fiscus.</span> (On "publicans" generally, see ch. 5:46, note; and for further details, Edersheim, 'Life,' 1. 515.) <span class="cmt_word">And he saith unto him,</span> <span class="cmt_word">Follow me</span>. No promise is given corresponding to that in ch. 4:19. <span class="cmt_word">And he arose, and followed him.</span> Perhaps the day's work was just over, or he may have left some assistant there. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:9 Matthew was in his calling, as the rest of those whom Christ called. As Satan comes with his temptations to the idle, so Christ comes with his calls to those who are employed. We are all naturally averse from thee, O God; do thou bid us to follow thee; draw us by thy powerful word, and we shall run after thee. Speak by the word of the Spirit to our hearts, the world cannot hold us down, Satan cannot stop our way, we shall arise and follow thee. A saving change is wrought in the soul, by Christ as the author, and his word as the means. Neither Matthew's place, nor his gains by it, could detain him, when Christ called him. He left it, and though we find the disciples, who were fishers, occasionally fishing again afterwards, we never more find Matthew at his sinful gain.</body></html>
