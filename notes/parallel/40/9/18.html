Assuming St. Matthew's own connection with the Gospel, we may justly, in this case, give greater weight to his order than to the arrangement of the other two, who derived the account from others.<p><span class= "bld">A certain ruler.</span>--St. Mark and St. Luke give the name Jairus, and state that he was "a ruler of the synagogue," probably an elder, or one of the <span class= "ital">Parnasim</span> or "pastors." The fact is interesting as suggesting a coincidence between this narrative and that of the centurion's servant. As a ruler of the synagogue, Jairus would probably have been among the elders of the Jews who came as a deputation to our Lord, and would thus have been impressed with His power to heal in cases which seemed hopeless.<p><span class= "bld">My daughter is even now dead.</span>--St. Luke adds, as one who had inquired into details, that she was the ruler's only child, was twelve years old, and that she "lay a dying," agreeing with St. Mark's "is at the point of death," literally, <span class= "ital">in extremis,</span> "at the last gasp;" and both add that the crowd that followed "thronged" and "pressed" our Lord as He went.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-34.</span> ? 4.

Matthew's account is much the shortest. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">While he spake these things unto them</span>. Matthew only. All the accounts represent our Lord as teaching when Jairus came to him; but in the parallel passages he was on the seashore (equivalent to our <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-34.htm">Matthew 8:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-1.htm">Matthew 9:1</a>). Matthew alone places his coming just after the question of the Baptist's disciples. Probably the words, "while he spake these things unto them," are not in their original connexion. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, there came a certain</span>; a (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> [<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> (for <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-19.htm">Matthew 8:19</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">Ruler</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>).

Sometimes the offices of <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> were held by the same person, and this may, perhaps, have been the case with Jairus (cf Schurer, II. it. p. 64). <span class="cmt_word">and worshipped him</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-2.htm">Matthew 8:2</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">Saying, My daughter is even now dead</span>.

And it is high honour to the greatest rulers to attend on the Lord Jesus; and those who would receive mercy from Christ, must honour him. The variety of methods Christ took in working his miracles, perhaps was because of the different frames and tempers of mind, which those were in who came to him, and which He who searches the heart perfectly knew. A poor woman applied herself to Christ, and received mercy from him by the way. If we do but touch, as it were, the hem of Christ's garment by living faith, our worst evils will be healed; there is no other real cure, nor need we fear his knowing things which are a grief and burden to us, but which we would not tell to any earthly friend. When Christ entered the ruler's house, he said, Give place. Sometimes, when the sorrow of the world prevails, it is difficult for Christ and his comforts to enter. The ruler's daughter was really dead, but not so to Christ. The death of the righteous is in a special manner to be looked on as only a sleep. The words and works of Christ may not at first be understood, yet they are not therefore to be despised. The people were put forth. Scorners who laugh at what they do not understand, are not proper witnesses of the wonderful works of Christ. Dead souls are not raised to spiritual life, unless Christ take them by the hand: it is done in the day of his power. If this single instance of Christ's raising one newly dead so increased his fame, what will be his glory when all that are in their graves shall hear his voice, and come forth; those that have done good to the resurrection of life, and those that have done evil to the resurrection of damnation!</body></html>
