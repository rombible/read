Where he would be undisturbed (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-36.htm">Matthew 13:36</a>). On the later occasion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-32.htm">Matthew 20:32</a>) Jesus stood still in the road. The blind men came to him. Close (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this?</span> They had professed faith in him, yet their after-conduct (ver. 31) shows that it was none too perfect. <span class="cmt_word">They said unto him, Yea, Lord</span>. <span class="accented">Said</span>; <span class="accented">say</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. The evangelist uses the more vivid present whenever he can. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-33.htm">Matthew 20:33</a> (though not in the parallel passages). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:27-31 At this time the Jews expected Messiah would appear; these blind men knew and proclaimed in the streets of Capernaum that he was come, and that Jesus was he. Those who, by the providence of God, have lost their bodily sight, may, by the grace of God, have the eyes of their understanding fully enlightened. And whatever our wants and burdens are, we need no more for supply and support, than to share in the mercy of our Lord Jesus. In Christ is enough for all. They followed him crying aloud. He would try their faith, and would teach us always to pray, and not to faint, though the answer does not come at once. They followed Christ, and followed him crying; but the great question is, Do ye believe? Nature may make us earnest, but it is only grace that can work faith. Christ touched their eyes. He gives sight to blind souls by the power of his grace going with his word, and he puts the cure upon their faith. Those who apply to Jesus Christ, shall be dealt with, not according to their fancies, nor according to their profession, but according to their faith. Christ sometimes concealed his miracles, because he would not indulge the conceit which prevailed among the Jews, that their Messiah should be a temporal prince, and so give occasion to the people to attempt tumults and seditions.</body></html>
