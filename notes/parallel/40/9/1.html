(For connexion of thought, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-18.htm">Matthew 8:18</a>, note.) In the parallel passages this narrative follows our <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-1.htm">Matthew 8:1-4</a>.

So completely did he grant the request of the Gadarenes. Observe that this expression is not an original phrase of the writer of the First Gospel, but is a reminiscence of the source that he has just used (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-18.htm">Mark 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-37.htm">Luke 8:37</a>; in both of which it now forms part of the preceding narrative). <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">passed over</span>; <span class="accented">crossed over</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, also in the source (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-21.htm">Mark 5:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And came into his own city</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Capernaum, where Mark says that the following miracle took place.

There "all the city" rejected him; here some of the leaders reject him, but the multitudes fear and glorify God (ver. 8). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-8 The faith of the friends of the paralytic in bringing him to Christ, was a strong faith; they firmly believed that Jesus Christ both could and would heal him. A strong faith regards no obstacles in pressing after Christ. It was a humble faith; they brought him to attend on Christ. It was an active faith. Sin may be pardoned, yet the sickness not be removed; the sickness may be removed, yet the sin not pardoned: but if we have the comfort of peace with God, with the comfort of recovery from sickness, this makes the healing a mercy indeed. This is no encouragement to sin. If thou bring thy sins to Jesus Christ, as thy malady and misery to be cured of, and delivered from, it is well; but to come with them, as thy darlings and delight, thinking still to retain them and receive him, is a gross mistake, a miserable delusion. The great intention of the blessed Jesus in the redemption he wrought, is to separate our hearts from sin. Our Lord Jesus has perfect knowledge of all that we say within ourselves. There is a great deal of evil in sinful thoughts, which is very offensive to the Lord Jesus. Christ designed to show that his great errand to the world was, to save his people from their sins. He turned from disputing with the scribes, and spake healing to the sick man. Not only he had no more need to be carried upon his bed, but he had strength to carry it. God must be glorified in all the power that is given to do good.</body></html>
