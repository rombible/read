These were probably those who had been present at the healing of the paralytic. the scribes who had come from Jerusalem. They, of course, would not enter the publican's house, but they stood outside and watched the mingled guests with wonder, and asked their two-fold question, "Why do <span class= "ital">ye</span> eat and drink . . . (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-30.htm" title="But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners?">Luke 5:30</a>)?" "Why doth <span class= "ital">your Master</span> . . .?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">when the Pharisees.</span> Mentioned thus far only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7</a> and Matthew 5:20. This is, therefore, the first time that Matthew speaks of them as coming into direct contact with Jesus. Although Mark (cf. Luke) says that the objection was raised by those among the Pharisees who were also scribes (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), yet the difference of expression from that in ver. 3 must not be overlooked. There the fact that they were scribes, accustomed to weigh the statements of the Law about blasphemy, etc., was prominent in the mind of the narrator; here it is rather the fact that they were Pharisees, men who by their very name professed to hold aloof from those who neglected the Law. <span class="cmt_word">Saw it</span>. They could freely come into the court of the house, and when there could both see and hear what was passing in the rooms that opened into it. <span class="cmt_word">They</span> said; <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">dieebaat</span> (Vulgate); "were saying." Their eager talk is brought vividly before us. <span class="cmt_word">Unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">his disciples.</span> Probably these were nearer to the Pharisees than Jesus himself was, or perhaps the Pharisees thought it easier to attack Jesus through them. On the naturalness of this remark in the mouth of Pharisees, <span class="accented">vide</span> Schurer, II. 2. p. 25. <span class="cmt_word">Why eateth your Master</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">Teacher</span> (Revised Version margin) is preferable, for both Pharisees and disciples realized that even Jesus' actions were intended to instruct his followers. But the reason for this action (<span class="accented">why</span>, cf. also ver. 14) they did not understand. It is possible that the order of the Greek points to irony on the part of the Pharisees. The man who presumes to be called <span class="accented">Teacher</span>, and whom the disciples accept as such, sets at defiance the primary rules of right and wrong. Professor Marshall (<span class="accented">Expositor</span>, IV. 4. p. 222) explains the variants "teacher" (here) and "drink" (parallel passages) by the original Aramaic word for "drink" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>) having been written here with the peculiar spelling of the Samaritan Targum (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">With</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">publicans and sinners?</span> Who form but one class (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). (For the thought, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-19.htm">Matthew 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-2.htm">Luke 15:2</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-5.htm">Psalm 101:5</a> [LXX.]. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:10-13 Some time after his call, Matthew sought to bring his old associates to hear Christ. He knew by experience what the grace of Christ could do, and would not despair concerning them. Those who are effectually brought to Christ, cannot but desire that others also may be brought to him. Those who suppose their souls to be without disease will not welcome the spiritual Physician. This was the case with the Pharisees; they despised Christ, because they thought themselves whole; but the poor publicans and sinners felt that they wanted instruction and amendment. It is easy, and too common, to put the worst constructions upon the best words and actions. It may justly be suspected that those have not the grace of God themselves, who are not pleased with others' obtaining it. Christ's conversing with sinners is here called mercy; for to promote the conversion of souls is the greatest act of mercy. The gospel call is a call to repentance; a call to us to change our minds, and to change our ways. If the children of men had not been sinners, there had been no need for Christ to come among them. Let us examine whether we have found out our sickness, and have learned to follow the directions of our great Physician.</body></html>
