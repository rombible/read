One serious difference has, however, to be noticed. Where in the earlier form of the precept we read, "cuseth her (the woman put away for any cause but adultery) to commit adultery," we have here, more emphatically as bearing on the position of the husband in such a case, the statement that he by contracting another marriage "commits adultery." The utmost that the law of Christ allows in such a case is a divorce, <span class= "ital">a mensa et thoro,</span> not <span class= "ital">a vinculo.</span> The legislation which permits the complete divorce on other grounds, such as cruelty or desertion on either side, is justified, so far as it is justifiable at all, on the ground of the "hardness of heart" which makes such a concession necessary. It is interesting to compare St. Paul's treatment of cases which the letter of this command did not cover, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/7-10.htm" title="And to the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:">1Corinthians 7:10-15</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I say unto you.</span> Our Lord here enunciates the law which was to obtain in his kingdom, which, indeed, was simply the reintroduction and enforcement of the primitive and natural ordinance. <span class="cmt_word">Except</span> it be <span class="cmt_word">for fornication;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>: <span class="accented">nisi ob fornicationem</span> (Vulgate).

The parallel passage in St. Mark (where Christ is stated to have made the remark to his disciples "in the house") omits the clause altogether.

These who affirm that the sin of married persons is never expressed by the word <span class="accented">porneia</span>, hold that it here signifies ante-nuptial unchastity, which would make the marriage void <span class="accented">ab initio</span>; post-nuptial transgression would be punished by death, not by divorce. In this view, our Lord would say that no divorce is allowable except where the wife is proved to have been unchaste before marriage. In such a case, the union being void from the first, the man is free to marry again. But there are difficulties in this interpretation. Why, at the end of the verse, is it called adultery to marry the divorced woman, if she was never really and lawfully married? Again, it is not correct to say that <span class="accented">porneia</span> denotes solely the sin of unmarried people. All illicit connection is described by this term, and it cannot be limited to one particular kind of transgression. In Ecclus. 23:23 it is used expressly of the sin of an adulteress. We may also remark that metaphorically idolatry is often called by this name, whereas, since Israel is supposed to be married to the Lord, the breaking of this bend by the worship of false gods might more strictly be named adultery. And yet again, there is no proof that the discovery of previous immorality in a wife did <span class="accented">ipso facto</span> vitiate the marriage (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>, etc.). The passages that are thought to bear on this matter are <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-13.htm">Deuteronomy 22:13-21</a> and Deuteronomy 24:1-4. In the former there is no question of divorce, - the offender is to be stoned; in the second passage the ground of divorce is "some uncleanness," or some unseemly thing, whether immorality or personal defect is meant cannot be decided, the rival schools taking different sides. But it is quite certain that adultery is not intended, and ante-nuptial unchastity is not even hinted. The interpretation, therefore, given above cannot be maintained. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Omitting for the moment the limiting clause, may we say that the general teaching of Christ makes for the indissolubility of the marriage bond? The majority of the Fathers from Hermas and Justin Martyr downwards affirm this. Those who admit that divorce is permissible in the case of the wife's adultery are unanimous in asserting that, by Christ's ordinance, remarriage is prohibited to the husband during the culprit's life; so that, practically, if divorce <span class="accented">a mensa et toro</span> is allowed, divorce <span class="accented">a vinculo is</span> refused. All Christ's utterances on the subject, saving the apparently restrictive clause (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>) and here, absolutely and plainly forbid divorce, on the ground of law and nature. The words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-11.htm">Mark 10:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-18.htm">Luke 16:18</a> are given without any limitation whatever. St. Paul draws from such his conclusion of the indissolubility of the marriage tie, as may be seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-10.htm">1 Corinthians 7:10, 11, 39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-2.htm">Romans 7:2, 3</a>. There could never have been a doubt about this subject had it not been for the difficulty in interpreting the parenthetical clause. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Are we, then, to suppose that Christ, by those words, modifies his general statement, and allows absolute divorce in the case of a wife's misconduct? Such is the view taken by many theologians, and practically endorsed by the civil law of many countries. Neither the Roman nor the Anglican Churches support this laxity. Ecclesiastical and civil laws are here antagonistic. It is said that Christ allows the wronged party to marry again. If so, if the oneness of the parties is wholly destroyed by the sin of the woman, why is it not permitted to a man to marry a divorced woman? This cannot be called adultery unless she is still one flesh with her husband, although separated. We must argue from this that divorce in such a case does not destroy the <span class="accented">vinculum matrimonii</span>, the marriage bond. and if not under this circumstance, surely under no other; for any other ground must be always less serious than adultery. If the clause in question enunciated an exception to the absolute rule elsewhere given, Christ would seem to stultify himself, to give two opposite decisions, and to introduce uncertainty in a most important verdict. The principle on which he based his dictum would be overthrown, and his hearers might have accused him of inconsistency. The solution offered for this difficulty is this - that Christ is contemplating merely what we call judicial separation; he considers that no trivial cause justifies this, in fact, nothing but fornication, and that this modified divorce does not free the man so that he may marry again; he is bound by the Law as long as his wife lives. Our Lord seems to have introduced the exceptional clause in order to answer what were virtually two questions of the Pharisees, viz. whether it was lawful to "put away a wife for every cause," and whether, when a man had legally divorced his wife, he might marry again. To the former Christ replies that separation was allowable only in the case of fornication; in response to the second, he rules that even in that case remarriage was wholly barred. <span class="cmt_word">And whosoever marrieth her which is put away</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, without the article); <span class="accented">her, when she is put away</span> (Revised Version); or, <span class="accented">a divorced woman</span>. The clause is wholly omitted by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> and some other manuscripts, and some modern editors, as Westcott and Hort. But it has very high authority in its favour. Alford renders, "her, when divorced," and restricts the application to a woman unlawfully divorced, not extending it to one separated for <span class="accented">porneia</span>. But the language is too indefinite to admit of this interpretation as certain (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-18.htm">Luke 16:18</a>, and the note on Matthew 5:32, where the popular view is expressed). The clause, pondered without regard to foregone conclusions, surely contains an argument for the indissolubility of the marriage tie, as we have said above. Marriage with a divorced wife can be rightly termed adultery only in consideration of the continuance of the vinculum. <span class="cmt_word">Doth commit adultery.</span> The binding nature of marriage does not depend on the will or the acts of the persons, but on its primal character and institution. By the repeal of the Mosaic relaxation and the restoration of marriage to its original principle, Christ not only enforces the high dignity of this ordinance, but obviates many opportunities of wickedness, such, for instance, as collusion between husband and wife with a view to obtain freedom for marriage with others. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:3-12 The Pharisees were desirous of drawing something from Jesus which they might represent as contrary to the law of Moses. Cases about marriage have been numerous, and sometimes perplexed; made so, not by the law of God, but by the lusts and follies of men; and often people fix what they will do, before they ask for advice. Jesus replied by asking whether they had not read the account of the creation, and the first example of marriage; thus pointing out that every departure therefrom was wrong. That condition is best for us, and to be chosen and kept to accordingly, which is best for our souls, and tends most to prepare us for, and preserve us to, the kingdom of heaven. When the gospel is really embraced, it makes men kind relatives and faithful friends; it teaches them to bear the burdens, and to bear with the infirmities of those with whom they are connected, to consider their peace and happiness more than their own. As to ungodly persons, it is proper that they should be restrained by laws, from breaking the peace of society. And we learn that the married state should be entered upon with great seriousness and earnest prayer.</body></html>
