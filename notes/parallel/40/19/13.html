The fact that they were brought (we may assume by their mothers) indicates that there was something in our Lord's look and manner that attracted children, and impressed their parents with the feeling that He loved them. That feeling, we may well believe, was deepened by His acts and words when He had taken in His arms the child whom He set before His disciples as a pattern of the true greatness of humility, and taught them that the angels of those little ones beheld the face of His Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-10.htm" title="Take heed that you despise not one of these little ones; for I say to you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 18:10</a>). The motives of the disciples in rebuking those that brought them, may, in like manner, be connected with what they had just heard from their Master's lips. What interest, they might have thought, could He have in these infants, when He had in those words appeared to claim for the "eunuch" life a special dignity and honour? What could the pressing claims of mothers and their children be to Him but a trouble and vexation, interfering with the higher life of meditation and of prayer?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-15.</span> - <span class="accented">Benediction of little children</span>. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-13.htm">Mark 10:13-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-15.htm">Luke 18:15-17</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - Christ, having laid his blessing on marriage, now blesses its fruit. <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>. This happened directly after the preceding conversation. Mothers were won to his side by his elevation of woman to her true position, and his marked tenderness to children. <span class="cmt_word">Little children</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>). St. Luke calls them <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;</span>, "their infants." These were babes whom the mothers carried in their arms, and who were too young to understand the meaning and importance of the act of Christ in blessing them. It was a custom to take infants to the synagogues, that they might receive the prayers and blessings of the rabbis, or holy men. For this reason they were brought to Christ as a holy and revered Teacher. <span class="cmt_word">That he should put his hands on them, and pray.</span> The laying on of hands was symbolical of blessing (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-14.htm">Genesis 48:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-23.htm">Numbers 27:23</a>). From the Jewish it passed into the Christian Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>), and continues unto this day to be used on various solemn occasions. <span class="cmt_word">The disciples rebuked them.</span> More definitely in St. Mark, "rebuked those that brought them." Why they did so is not quite obvious. Either they thought that it was beneath Christ's dignity, and a waste of his precious time to attend to these babes; or, being still of imperfect faith, they did not realize that any spiritual good could proceed from the imposition of Christ's hands upon unconscious and irresponsive infants. They had seen him cure bodily diseases with a touch, and they would have welcomed these little ones it' they had been brought to be healed of some obvious maladies; what they could not understand was that these irrational creatures, not possessed of faith, could be the recipients of Divine blessing. Christ, by word and action, teaches another lesson. St. Mark adds that Jesus was "much displeased" at the disciples' faithless interference. St. Luke tells us that he "called them [the babes] unto him," making his followers desist from their officious remonstrance, and said the memorable words which are given almost without variation by the three synoptists. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:13-15 It is well when we come to Christ ourselves, and bring our children. Little children may be brought to Christ as needing, and being capable of receiving blessings from him, and having an interest in his intercession. We can but beg a blessing for them: Christ only can command the blessing. It is well for us, that Christ has more love and tenderness in him than the best of his disciples have. And let us learn of him not to discountenance any willing, well-meaning souls, in their seeking after Christ, though they are but weak. Those who are given to Christ, as part of his purchase, he will in no wise cast out. Therefore he takes it ill of all who forbid, and try to shut out those whom he has received. And all Christians should bring their children to the Saviour that he may bless them with spiritual blessings.</body></html>
