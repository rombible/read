From the former we get the outlines of what has been called, as being "beyond Jordan," our Lord's Peraean ministry, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-51.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,">Luke 9:51</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-30.htm" title="Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.">Luke 18:30</a>; from the latter, according to the arrangement of the best harmonists, His visit to Jerusalem at the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-2.htm" title="Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.">John 7:2</a>), and again at that of the Dedication (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-22.htm" title="And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.">John 10:22</a>). To keep these facts in mind will throw some light on the narrative that follows here. The journey from Galilee to Peraea appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the middle of Samaria and Galilee.">Luke 17:11</a> to have led our Lord through Samaria.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-12.</span> - <span class="accented">The beginning of the last journey to Jerusalem</span>. <span class="accented">The question concerning divorce</span>. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-1.htm">Mark 10:1-12</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Jesus had finished these sayings.</span> This is the beginning of a new section of the history, commencing, as usual, with the formulary, <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass.</span> "These sayings" must refer to what was recorded in ch. 18. But St. Matthew's narrative omits many events that happened in the interval between the account of the Galilaean ministry and the history of these last days, that is, from the autumn of one year to the spring of the next. The transactions of this time, which are omitted also by St. Mark, are given by St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51-17:11</a>) and St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-2.htm">John 7:2-11:54</a>), comprising many things that occurred at Jerusalem during the Feast of Tabernacles and on other occlusions. <span class="cmt_word">He departed from Galilee.</span> Not visiting it again till he appeared there after his resurrection. There was no part of the Holy Land in which he did not at some time sojourn, and now, as the final consummation drew nigh, he resolutely set his face towards Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Came into the coasts of Judea beyond Jordan.</span> <span class="accented">Coasts</span> should be <span class="accented">borders</span>. Judaea was bounded by the river, and there was no part of it beyond, that is, on the east of Jordan. The words, "beyond Jordan," belong to the verb "came," and the clause signifies that the object of Christ's journey was the vicinity of Judaea, and that, instead of entering the province by the direct road through Samaria, he took the more lengthy but safer route through Peraea. This was the name of the region on the east of the Jordan (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">beyond</span>), extending at this time from the river Hieromax, or Jarmouk, on the north, to the Arnon on the south, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to the middle of the eastern shore of the Dead Sea. The ruler of this district was Herod Antipas, and it was at this era in a most flourishing condition, notably fertile, and containing many fine towns ornamented with magnificent buildings. Here the simple, pastoral country people were less influenced by the narrow bigotry of the Pharisaic party, and in the towns the ban which excluded Jesus from the synagogues of Galilee and Judaea was either not recognized or not enforced. A quiet opportunity for preaching the gospel was thus offered. This may possibly be the sojourn in Peraea mentioned by St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-40.htm">John 10:40-42</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1,2 Great multitudes followed Christ. When Christ departs, it is best for us to follow him. They found him as able and ready to help elsewhere, as he had been in Galilee; wherever the Sun of Righteousness arose, it was with healing in his wings.</body></html>
