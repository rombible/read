They looked forward to the possible discomforts of marriage under the conditions which their Master had set before them, and drew the conclusion that they outweighed its advantages. Why entangle themselves in a union which they were no longer able to dissolve, when they got tired of it, by the short and easy method of a bill of divorcement? It is instructive to remember that one of the greatest of English writers has taken the same line of thought in dealing with the question. Milton's <span class= "ital">Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce,</span> and the treatises that followed it, are but an elaborate and eloquent expression of the words of the disciples, "If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His disciples say unto him.</span> Our Lord appears to have repeated privately to the disciples what he had said publicly to the Pharisees. <span class="cmt_word">If the case</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the man be so with his wife.</span> Some commentators take <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to signify <span class="accented">guilt</span>: "if such guilt appertains to the married state." But the meaning is plain enough anyway, and the word, <span class="cmt_word">as</span> here used, corresponds to the Latin <span class="accented">causa</span>, and the Hebrew <span class="accented">dibrah</span>, which may denote "case," "condition," etc. The disciples reflect the feeling of their day. Marriage without any possibility of essential release (for they see that this is Christ's law) seems to them a severe and unbearable connection. It were better never to marry at all than to fetter one's self with such an inexorable obligation. Such a doctrine was entirely novel in that age, and most unpalatable; and even the apostles receive it with wonder and hesitation. They have not yet leaned that in Messiah's kingdom grace conquers natural inclination, and strengthens the weak will so that it rises superior to custom, prejudice, and the promptings of the flesh. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:3-12 The Pharisees were desirous of drawing something from Jesus which they might represent as contrary to the law of Moses. Cases about marriage have been numerous, and sometimes perplexed; made so, not by the law of God, but by the lusts and follies of men; and often people fix what they will do, before they ask for advice. Jesus replied by asking whether they had not read the account of the creation, and the first example of marriage; thus pointing out that every departure therefrom was wrong. That condition is best for us, and to be chosen and kept to accordingly, which is best for our souls, and tends most to prepare us for, and preserve us to, the kingdom of heaven. When the gospel is really embraced, it makes men kind relatives and faithful friends; it teaches them to bear the burdens, and to bear with the infirmities of those with whom they are connected, to consider their peace and happiness more than their own. As to ungodly persons, it is proper that they should be restrained by laws, from breaking the peace of society. And we learn that the married state should be entered upon with great seriousness and earnest prayer.</body></html>
