St. Luke connects them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/10-17.htm" title="And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject to us through your name.">Luke 10:17-24</a>) with the return of the Seventy; but as their mission is not recorded by St. Matthew, it seems reasonable to connect them, as here recorded, with the return of the Twelve, and their report of their work (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-30.htm" title="And the apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.">Mark 6:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-10.htm" title="And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.">Luke 9:10</a>). Their presence, it may be noted, is implied in the narrative with which the next chapter opens. The words, however, were probably repeated as analogous occasions called for them.<p><span class= "bld">I thank thee.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">I confess unto Thee</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> "acknowledge with praise and thanksgiving." The abruptness with which the words come in points to the fragmentary character of the record which St. Matthew incorporates with his Gospel. The context in St. Luke implies a reference to the truths of the kingdom which the disciples had proclaimed, and makes special mention of the joy which thus expressed itself. The two grounds of that joy are inseparably linked together. The "wise and prudent" (comp. the union of the same words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-19.htm" title="For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.">1Corinthians 1:19</a>) were the scribes and Pharisees, wise in their conceit, seeking men's praise rather than truth as truth, and therefore shut out from the knowledge that requires above all things sincerity of purpose. The "babes" were the disciples who had received the kingdom in the spirit of a little child, child-like, and sometimes even childish, in their thoughts of it, but who, being in earnest and simple-hearted, were brought under the training which was to make them as true scribes for the kingdom of heaven. He, their Lord, taught them as they were able to bear it, giving (to use St. Paul's familiar image) the milk that belonged to babes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-2.htm" title="I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for till now you were not able to bear it, neither yet now are you able.">1Corinthians 3:2</a>); but beyond His personal teaching there were the flashes of intuition by which (as, conspicuously, in the case of Peter's confession, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-17.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood has not revealed it to you, but my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 16:17</a>) new truths were suddenly disclosed to them, or old truths seen with increasing clearness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-27.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-21.htm">Luke 10:21, 22</a>, where the verses are recorded immediately after the return of the seventy. We know no other occasion which would be so likely to evoke this utterance. Although it is just possible that the seventy returned when our Lord was addressing the people in the manner related in the preceding verses of this chapter, it seems much more likely that a sense of a moral and not of a temporal connexion guided St. Matthew in his arrangement. What is true in a time of success (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-17.htm">Luke 10:17, 18</a>) is equally true in a time of failure (vers. 20-24). Observe the difference in the style of ver. 27 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-22.htm">Luke 10:22</a>) from that of vers. 25, 26, suggesting the use of another, apparently Johannine, source. But this must have been added before either St. Matthew or St. Luke incorporated the passage. Observe that the comparatively early date thus indicated for Johannine phraseology suggests that the language and form of the Fourth Gospel underwent a long process of development before St. John completed his work. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At that time</span>; <span class="accented">season</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;</span>. St. Luke's phrase ("in that very hour," <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;</span>) is more precise, definitely connecting the utterance with the return of the seventy. St. Matthew's refers rather to that stage or period in his ministry (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-1.htm">Matthew 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-1.htm">Matthew 14:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered</span>. Only in Matthew. If we could suppose this to be the original context of the passage, the" answer" would probably refer to some expression of astonishment or complaint at his solemn statement in vers. 20-24. Professor Marshall's derivation of both "answered" and "rejoiced" (Luke) from a common Aramaic original (<span class="accented">Expositor</span>, April, 1891) appears very strained. <span class="cmt_word">And said, I thank thee</span>; better, as the Revised Version margin, <span class="accented">praise</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). There is no thought of gratitude, but of publicity in assent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-6.htm">Luke 22:6</a>), in confession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-6.htm">Matthew 3:6</a>) and in acknowledgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-11.htm">Romans 14:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>), and thus of praise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-11.htm">Ezra 10:11</a> (Lucian); <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-22.htm">2 Chronicles 30:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-9.htm">Romans 15:9</a>). It implies a profession of personal acceptance by Christ of God's methods. "I profess to thee my entire and joyful acquiescence in what thou doest." Hence St. Luke introduces the utterance by <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, adding <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>, thus giving us a glimpse of the unity of purpose and feeling inherent in the Trinity, even during the time that the Word "tabernacled among us." <span class="cmt_word">O Father</span>. <span class="accented">Father</span> occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34, 46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-41.htm">John 11:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-27.htm">John 12:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-1.htm">John 17:1</a>; in fact, in all the recorded prayers of our Lord except <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>, which is a quotation, and where the phrase, "My God, my God," emphasizes his sense of desolation. The word expresses perfect relationship and intimate communion. It points to the trust, the love, and the obedience of Christ, and to the depth of natural affection and confidence (if we may say so) between him and the First Person of the Trinity. It suggests mercies in the past, care in the present, and provision for the future. <span class="cmt_word">Lord of heaven and earth</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-24.htm">Acts 17:24</a>, by St. Paul, who may have derived it from these words of our Lord (Resch, ' Agmpha,' p. 150), or perhaps from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-6.htm">Psalm 146:6</a> or <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>. As "Father" was the note of personal relationship, so is this of sovereign majesty. Christ unites the thought of God's love to himself with that of his ownership of all creation, thus paving the way for the main subject of the prayer - his Father's method of dealing with men of various kinds and tempers. <span class="cmt_word">Because</span>; <span class="accented">that</span> (Revised Version), perhaps as more idiomatic with "thank." But <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> here gives, not the contents of the "thanksgiving," but the reason for it. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes</span>.

Observe that the sentence is not a kind of hendiadys, but that Christ accepts his Father's action in both directions.

(For the general truth, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-24.htm">Job 37:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-19.htm">1 Corinthians 1:19-27</a>.) <span class="accented">And hast revealed them</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11</a>, note); for even the most guileless heart has no power to see spiritual truths unless God draws back the veil. <span class="accented">Unto babes</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>). The thought is of their helplessness and dependence.

The phrase implies, not merely that it seemed good to God, but that, in a sense, it was his pleasure. For the workings out of the laws of truth must give pleasure to the <span class="cmt_word"></span> God of truth. (On the aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, see ver. 25, note.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="pc_st_rem">Matthew 11:27 <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All</span> <span class="cmt_word">things.</span> Not in the widest sense, for this would forestall ch. 28:18 but all things that are required for my work <span class="cmt_word">of</span> manifesting the truth. The utterance is thus both closely parallel to <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28</a>, and also in most intimate connexion with the preceding verses. God's twofold action in hiding the truth from some and revealing it to others is, our Lord says, all of a piece with my whole work. This is all arranged by my Father, and the knowledge of God by any man is no chance matter. <span class="cmt_word">Are</span> <span class="cmt_word">delivered unto me;</span> <span class="accented">have been delivered</span> (Revised Version); rather, <span class="accented">were delivered</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>). Here also it is possible to interpret the aorist from the standpoint of the hereafter (ver. 25, note); but, as it is immediately followed by the present tense, it more probably refers to some time earlier than that at which our Lord was speaking. The time of his entrance on the world naturally suggests itself. Observe when bringing out his dependence upon his Father, our Lord lays stress on the notion of transmission (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>); but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>, where he is bringing out his post-resurrection greatness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>), he merely mentions his authority as an absolute gift (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>). Notice the contrast implied in <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> to the Jewish <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>.

For the transmission was immediate; there were no links between the Giver and the Receiver (cf. Bishop Lightfoot, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-12.htm">Galatians 1:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">My Father</span>; me... my.

In the Gospels this word is used of the knowledge of God and of Christ in this verse alone, though such a reference is especially suited to its meaning of perfection of know. ledge (cf. Bishop Lightfoot, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Son</span>. Not "me," because Christ wished <span class="cmt_word">to</span> bring out more clearly his unique relation to God, and thus to emphasize the impossibility of any one, even an advanced disciple, fully knowing him. <span class="cmt_word">But the Father</span>. Not "his Father." It may be that Christ wishes to include the suggestion that after all there is a sense in which his Father is the Father of all men, but more probably, by making <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span> completely parallel to <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, he wishes to suggest that the full idea of Sonship and Fatherhood is nowhere else so fully satisfied. <span class="cmt_word">Neither knoweth any man</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Father, save the Son, and</span> he <span class="cmt_word">to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.</span> The connexion is - You may think this (<span class="accented">i.e. ver.</span> 25) strange, but I alone have that knowledge of God which enables me to understand his ways; I alone, yet others also, if I reveal him to them. As St. Luke expressed it in his form of our ver. 19, "Wisdom is justified of her children" (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>). <span class="accented">To whomsoever.</span> Though but a babe (ver. 25). <span class="accented">Will reveal</span>; <span class="accented">willeth to reveal</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Not "is commanded," for Christ claims equality (see Chrysostom). Notice the idea of plan and deliberation, and not that of mere desire, unable, perhaps, to assign a reason for its existence (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-13.htm">Philemon 1:13, 14</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:25-30 It becomes children to be grateful. When we come to God as a Father, we must remember that he is Lord of heaven and earth, which obliges us to come to him with reverence as to the sovereign Lord of all; yet with confidence, as one able to defend us from evil, and to supply us with all good. Our blessed Lord added a remarkable declaration, that the Father had delivered into his hands all power, authority, and judgment. We are indebted to Christ for all the revelation we have of God the Father's will and love, ever since Adam sinned. Our Saviour has invited all that labour and are heavy-laden, to come unto him. In some senses all men are so. Worldly men burden themselves with fruitless cares for wealth and honours; the gay and the sensual labour in pursuit of pleasures; the slave of Satan and his own lusts, is the merest drudge on earth. Those who labour to establish their own righteousness also labour in vain. The convinced sinner is heavy-laden with guilt and terror; and the tempted and afflicted believer has labours and burdens. Christ invites all to come to him for rest to their souls. He alone gives this invitation; men come to him, when, feeling their guilt and misery, and believing his love and power to help, they seek him in fervent prayer. Thus it is the duty and interest of weary and heavy-laden sinners, to come to Jesus Christ. This is the gospel call; Whoever will, let him come. All who thus come will receive rest as Christ's gift, and obtain peace and comfort in their hearts. But in coming to him they must take his yoke, and submit to his authority. They must learn of him all things, as to their comfort and obedience. He accepts the willing servant, however imperfect the services. Here we may find rest for our souls, and here only. Nor need we fear his yoke. His commandments are holy, just, and good. It requires self-denial, and exposes to difficulties, but this is abundantly repaid, even in this world, by inward peace and joy. It is a yoke that is lined with love. So powerful are the assistances he gives us, so suitable the encouragements, and so strong the consolations to be found in the way of duty, that we may truly say, it is a yoke of pleasantness. The way of duty is the way of rest. The truths Christ teaches are such as we may venture our souls upon. Such is the Redeemer's mercy; and why should the labouring and burdened sinner seek for rest from any other quarter? Let us come to him daily, for deliverance from wrath and guilt, from sin and Satan, from all our cares, fears, and sorrows. But forced obedience, far from being easy and light, is a heavy burden. In vain do we draw near to Jesus with our lips, while the heart is far from him. Then come to Jesus to find rest for your souls.</body></html>
