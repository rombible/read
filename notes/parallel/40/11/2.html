Herod himself observed him, and heard him gladly. Herodias had not yet found an occasion of revenge. His disciples came and went freely. Some of these we have seen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-14.htm" title="Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but your disciples fast not?">Matthew 9:14</a>) as present when our Lord was teaching, and certain to hear of such wonders as those narrated in Matthew 8, 9. He himself, in the prison of Machaerus, was languishing with the sickness of hope deferred for the Messianic kingdom, which he had proclaimed. His disciples brought back word of what they had seen and heard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-18.htm" title="And the disciples of John showed him of all these things.">Luke 7:18</a>), and yet all things continued as before, and there was no deliverance either for himself or Israel. Under the influence of this disappointment, he sent his two disciples with the question which the next verse records.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-24.</span> - JESUS THE ONE THAT SHOULD COME. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Vers. 2-6: The Baptist's question, and its answer: the Coming One has come. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Vers. 7-15: Jesus' recognition of the greatness of John as herald. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Vers. 16-19: Yet both John and he himself are rejected. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Vers. 20-24: Woe on those who disregard the signs of God's work. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-6.</span> <span class="accented">- The Baptist's question</span>, <span class="accented">and its answer.</span> Parallel passage: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-18.htm">Luke 7:18-23</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now when John had</span> (omit, with the Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">heard in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the prison</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Machaerus (Schurer, 1. 2:27; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1</a>, note; Matthew 14:1, note). Matthew alone tells us that he was already in prison. <span class="cmt_word">The works of</span> <span class="cmt_word">Christ</span>; <span class="accented">of the Christ</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. Not the proper name, but the official title (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-16.htm">Matthew 1:16, 17</a>, notes). The title may be merely due to the evangelist's narrative, or may represent the actual terms in which the message was brought to John. It brings out the pathos of the situation. John had prepared the way of the Christ, and had at the baptism taken part in his anointing. Yet of all the works that the Christ now did there was none to set his kinsman and herald free. <span class="cmt_word">He sent two of his</span> <span class="cmt_word">disciples</span>; <span class="accented">by his disciples</span> (Revised Version). Possibly the slight difference between <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span>, the true reading here, and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;</span>, which is genuine in Luke, points to the common source (observe here a Greek source) having been written, but with the close similarity in sound this need not have been the case. Observe that the true reading lays slightly more emphasis on the fact of the inquiry coming from John himself (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>). "Sent by" is the equivalent of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-13.htm">Exodus 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-20.htm">1 Samuel 16:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-25.htm">1 Kings 2:25</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:2-6 Some think that John sent this inquiry for his own satisfaction. Where there is true faith, yet there may be a mixture of unbelief. The remaining unbelief of good men may sometimes, in an hour of temptation; call in question the most important truths. But we hope that John's faith did not fail in this matter, and that he only desired to have it strengthened and confirmed. Others think that John sent his disciples to Christ for their satisfaction. Christ points them to what they heard and saw. Christ's gracious condescensions and compassions to the poor, show that it was he that should bring to the world the tender mercies of our God. Those things which men see and hear, if compared with the Scriptures, direct in what way salvation is to be found. It is difficult to conquer prejudices, and dangerous not to conquer them; but those who believe in Christ, their faith will be found so much the more to praise, and honour, and glory.</body></html>
