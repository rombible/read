At least one instance of each class of miracle has already been recorded by St. Matthew, the blind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-27.htm" title="And when Jesus departed there, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, You son of David, have mercy on us.">Matthew 9:27</a>), the lame (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-6.htm" title="But that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (then said he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.">Matthew 9:6</a>), the leper (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-2.htm" title="And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.">Matthew 8:2</a>), the dead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-25.htm" title="But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.">Matthew 9:25</a>). The raising of the widow's son at Nain, which in St. Luke follows closely upon the healing of the centurion's servant, must also have preceded what is here narrated. What the Baptist needed was, not the knowledge of fresh facts, but a different way of looking at those he already knew. Where these works were done, there were tokens that the coming One had indeed come. But above all signs and wonders, there was another spiritual note of the kingdom, which our Lord reserves as the last and greatest: <span class= "ital">Poor men have the good news proclaimed to them.</span> They are invited to the kingdom, and told of peace and pardon. It is as though our Lord knew that the Baptist, whose heart was with the poor, would feel that One who thus united power and tenderness could be none other than the expected King.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear</span> (<span class="accented">and</span>, Revised Version), <span class="cmt_word">the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.</span> The first and the last of the examples selected by our Lord are fulfilments or' prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>). Observe that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the words are taken from the LXX. (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>), which, perhaps, represents a different reading from the Massoretic text (cf. Cheyne, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>, 'Critical Note'). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Our Lord reverses the order of the expressions, taking the restoration of sight to the blind as the commencement of a series of physical miracles, and thus making spiritual work the climax. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> He does not quote Isaiah's phrase, "liberty to the captives," although the quotation of its context could not but suggest it to John, the reason being, it would seem, that he desired to call John's attention away from the more political part of Messiah's work to that which alone forms the basis of permanent political improvement - the restoration of the individual. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> In accordance with this is the fact that when he was laying stress on the character of his adherents as the one qualification for sharing in his kingdom, he alluded to the same passage of Isaiah (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3-5</a>). John was not wholly emancipated from the Jewish tendency to regard the external results of the kingdom; our Lord's mind dwelt rather on the internal results. Although John's difficulty had been felt when he heard of the works (ver. 2, note), our Lord only said in reply, "Tell him of my works." It was an old message, and yet a new one. In the nature of those works, when fully understood, lay the true solution of his difficulty. Observe that here also Christ adds a Beatitude (ver. 6). <span class="accented">The blind</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-27.htm">Matthew 9:27</a>, note), (<span class="accented">and the lame.</span> The "and" is doubtless genuine here, its omission in some manuscripts being due to the parallel passage in Luke. Observe the rhythm, "blind and lame," "lepers and deaf," "and dead and poor." Perhaps this is the result of oral transmission. <span class="accented">The lame walk</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>). <span class="accented">The dead are raised up.</span> "Quod novissime factum erat juveni Nainitico" (Bengel; and so Ellicott, 'Hist.

Where there is true faith, yet there may be a mixture of unbelief. The remaining unbelief of good men may sometimes, in an hour of temptation; call in question the most important truths. But we hope that John's faith did not fail in this matter, and that he only desired to have it strengthened and confirmed. Others think that John sent his disciples to Christ for their satisfaction. Christ points them to what they heard and saw. Christ's gracious condescensions and compassions to the poor, show that it was he that should bring to the world the tender mercies of our God. Those things which men see and hear, if compared with the Scriptures, direct in what way salvation is to be found. It is difficult to conquer prejudices, and dangerous not to conquer them; but those who believe in Christ, their faith will be found so much the more to praise, and honour, and glory.</body></html>
