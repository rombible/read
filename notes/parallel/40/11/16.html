They form themselves into companies, and get up a dramatic representation of wedding festivities and funeral pomp. They play their pipes, and expect others to dance; they beat their breasts in lamentation, and expect others to weep. They complain if others do not comply with their demands. To such a company our Lord likens the evil generation in which He and the Baptist lived. They were loud in their complaints of the Baptist because he would not share their self-indulgent mirth; they were bitter against Jesus because He would not live according to the rules of their hypocritical austerity. Thus interpreted, the whole passage is coherent. The more common explanation inverts the comparison, and sees in our Lord and the Baptist those who invite to mourning and to mirth respectively, and are repelled by their sullen playmates. This would in itself give an adequate meaning, but it does not fall in with our Lord's language, which specifically identifies the children who invite <span class= "ital">the others</span> (this rather than "their fellows," is the true reading) with the "generation" which He condemns. The verses that follow, giving the language in which the same generation vented its anger and scorn against the two forms of holiness, agree better with the interpretation here adopted.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-19.</span> <span class="accented">- Yet both John and he himself are rejected</span>, <span class="accented">though the results of their efforts were such as to fully justify the apparent difference of their methods.</span> Parallel passage. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-31.htm">Luke 7:31-35</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>. In contrast to the obedience asked for in ver. 15, this generation closes its ears. <span class="cmt_word">Whereunto shall I liken</span>. A common rabbinic phrase, which is often found in the fuller form recorded in Luke, "Whereunto shall I liken... and to what are they like?" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">This generation?. It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.</span> There are two ways of understanding the illustration which our Lord here uses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Many modern commentators (e.g. Meyer; Trench,' Studies,' p. 148) insist on the grammar and on the historical order in which the complaints are made, and believe that the Jews correspond to the pipers and the mourners, while it is John that refuses to rejoice, and our Lord that will not be sad. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> But the more usual interpretation is preferable. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> in an illustrative saying one has chiefly to regard its general sense; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> in vers. 18, 19 the action of John and of our Lord in "coming" corresponds to the activity of the children; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> this interpretation seems much more in accordance with the context. The verses are therefore to be understood as meaning- John mourned in urging repentance, our Lord rejoiced in gospel liberty and preaching, but both alike were only ridiculed by the Jews. <span class="accented">Markets</span>; <span class="accented">marketplaces</span> (Revised Version); for there is no thought of the children helping their elders in traffic. <span class="accented">And calling</span> (<span class="accented">which call</span>, Revised Version) <span class="accented">unto their fellows.</span> Addressing them, but not necessarily noisily (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-13.htm">Luke 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-12.htm">Luke 13:12</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:16-24 Christ reflects on the scribes and Pharisees, who had a proud conceit of themselves. He likens their behaviour to children's play, who being out of temper without reason, quarrel with all the attempts of their fellows to please them, or to get them to join in the plays for which they used to assemble. The cavils of worldly men are often very trifling and show great malice. Something they have to urge against every one, however excellent and holy. Christ, who was undefiled, and separate from sinners, is here represented as in league with them, and polluted by them. The most unspotted innocence will not always be a defence against reproach. Christ knew that the hearts of the Jews were more bitter and hardened against his miracles and doctrines, than those of Tyre and Sidon would have been; therefore their condemnation would be the greater. The Lord exercises his almighty power, yet he punishes none more than they deserve, and never withholds the knowledge of the truth from those who long after it.</body></html>
