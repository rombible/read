(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/51-26.htm" title="Put your neck under the yoke, and let your soul receive instruction: she is hard at hand to find.">Ecclesiasticus 51:26</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">I am meek and lowly in heart.</span>--The stress lies upon the last words. Others might be lowly with the lowliness which is ambition's ladder, but pride and self-assertion were reigning in their hearts. The Christ, in His infinite sympathy with men of all classes and conditions, could boldly incur the risk of seeming to boast of His humility, in order that He might win men to come and prove by experience that He was able and willing to give them rest, to hear the tale of their sorrows, and to turn from none with scorn.<p><span class= "bld">Ye shall find rest unto your souls.</span>--Here, as often elsewhere in our Lord's teaching, we have a direct quotation from Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-16.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, Stand you in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and you shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein.">Jeremiah 6:16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - Vers. 29, 30 have so much in common with both the language and the thought of Ecclus. 51:26, 27, that probably this passage was in our Lord's mind. It is noteworthy that most of the other signs of acquaintance with Ecclesiasticus are found in the Epistle of St. James (cf. Edersheim, in the 'Speaker's Commentary' on Ecclesiasticus, p. 22). <span class="cmt_word">Take my</span> <span class="cmt_word">yoke upon you</span>. For there is work to be done, therefore enter on it. The yoke is the service that Christ gives us to do, and therefore implies more than his teaching. This, however, is so important a part of his service, both in itself and as being the means of knowing what he wishes done, that Christ speaks of it as though almost identical with his yoke. (On the figure of the yoke, compare a note by Professor Ryle and Mr. James, in 'Psalms of Solomon,' 7:8, suggesting that our Lord was contrasting his yoke with the yoke of minute legal observance laid upon the people by the scribes and Pharisees. For a detailed description of the yoke and plough used now in Palestine, see an article by Dr. Post in the Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration for 1891, p. 112.) <span class="cmt_word">And learn of me</span>. The figure of the oxen passes into that of the scholars. The "of" is slightly ambiguous, and may refer to Christ as the Example from which they may draw the lesson for themselves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-32.htm">Matthew 24:32</a>), or as the Teacher who will himself instruct them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a>). The second meaning is more suitable here. (For the thought, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-31.htm">John 8:31</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">For</span>. The reason why they should learn from him and no other teacher. He alone was what he claimed to teach, therefore he alone could teach it properly, and therefore from him alone could they learn that type of character which they ought to develop. <span class="cmt_word">I am</span>. Observe the claim. It is almost greater than that of ver. 27. <span class="cmt_word">Meek</span>. Primarily, as regards God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>, note). Receiving in my degree whatever yoke my Father puts on me. <span class="cmt_word">And lowly in heart</span>. As regards men. Observe that <span class="accented">meek</span> and <span class="accented">lowly</span> correspond, though the order is reversed, to "He humbled himself and became obedient" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> does not refer to the Incarnation (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>), but to his relation to others in this world). <span class="accented">In heart</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>, note). "Lowly in heart" very nearly corresponds to "he that is of a lowly spirit." Such a person as Christ's experience shows (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>) "shall obtain honour" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-23.htm">Proverbs 29:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And ye shall find rest unto your souls</span>. In this learning and service. The words are taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-16.htm">Jeremiah 6:16</a> (not the LXX.; cf. also Ecclus. 6:28), where they form the promise given to those that ask for the old paths and walk in the good way of the Divine commandments. But these roads were now more clearly made known in Christ. Observe the full force of the two expressions, <span class="accented">I will give you rest</span> (ver. 28), and <span class="accented">Ye shall find rest.</span> The tired comers are at once refreshed by Christ; these accept his service and teaching, and in performing it find further rest. The first rest may be termed the peace of justification; the second, <span class="accented">that</span> of sanctification. Both are obtained through Christ alone, yet they are not to be confused, much less identified, with one another. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:25-30 It becomes children to be grateful. When we come to God as a Father, we must remember that he is Lord of heaven and earth, which obliges us to come to him with reverence as to the sovereign Lord of all; yet with confidence, as one able to defend us from evil, and to supply us with all good. Our blessed Lord added a remarkable declaration, that the Father had delivered into his hands all power, authority, and judgment. We are indebted to Christ for all the revelation we have of God the Father's will and love, ever since Adam sinned. Our Saviour has invited all that labour and are heavy-laden, to come unto him. In some senses all men are so. Worldly men burden themselves with fruitless cares for wealth and honours; the gay and the sensual labour in pursuit of pleasures; the slave of Satan and his own lusts, is the merest drudge on earth. Those who labour to establish their own righteousness also labour in vain. The convinced sinner is heavy-laden with guilt and terror; and the tempted and afflicted believer has labours and burdens. Christ invites all to come to him for rest to their souls. He alone gives this invitation; men come to him, when, feeling their guilt and misery, and believing his love and power to help, they seek him in fervent prayer. Thus it is the duty and interest of weary and heavy-laden sinners, to come to Jesus Christ. This is the gospel call; Whoever will, let him come. All who thus come will receive rest as Christ's gift, and obtain peace and comfort in their hearts. But in coming to him they must take his yoke, and submit to his authority. They must learn of him all things, as to their comfort and obedience. He accepts the willing servant, however imperfect the services. Here we may find rest for our souls, and here only. Nor need we fear his yoke. His commandments are holy, just, and good. It requires self-denial, and exposes to difficulties, but this is abundantly repaid, even in this world, by inward peace and joy. It is a yoke that is lined with love. So powerful are the assistances he gives us, so suitable the encouragements, and so strong the consolations to be found in the way of duty, that we may truly say, it is a yoke of pleasantness. The way of duty is the way of rest. The truths Christ teaches are such as we may venture our souls upon. Such is the Redeemer's mercy; and why should the labouring and burdened sinner seek for rest from any other quarter? Let us come to him daily, for deliverance from wrath and guilt, from sin and Satan, from all our cares, fears, and sorrows. But forced obedience, far from being easy and light, is a heavy burden. In vain do we draw near to Jesus with our lips, while the heart is far from him. Then come to Jesus to find rest for your souls.</body></html>
