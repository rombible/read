That of the nobleman's son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/4-46.htm" title="So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.">John 4:46-54</a>), of the demoniac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/1-21.htm" title="And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.">Mark 1:21-28</a>), the man sick of the palsy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/9-1.htm" title="And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city.">Matthew 9:1-8</a>), of Peter's wife's mother and the many works that followed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/8-1.htm" title="When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.">Matthew 8:1-14</a>), of the woman with the issue of blood, and of Jairus's daughter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/9-18.htm" title="While he spoke these things to them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay your hand on her, and she shall live.">Matthew 9:18-26</a>), of the centurion's servant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/8-5.htm" title="And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion, beseeching him,">Matthew 8:5-13</a>), had all been wrought there, besides the unrecorded "signs" implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-23.htm" title="And he said to them, You will surely say to me this proverb, Physician, heal yourself: whatever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in your country.">Luke 4:23</a>. In this sense, and not in any outward prosperity, had Capernaum been "exalted unto heaven." All this, however, had been in vain, and therefore the sentence was passed on it that it should be "brought down to hell," i.e., to <span class= "ital">Hades,</span> the grave, not <span class= "ital">Gehenna.</span> The words point, as the next verse shows, to the ultimate abasement of the guilty city in the day of judgment, but the words have had an almost literal fulfilment. A few ruins conjecturally identified mark the site of Capernaum. Not one stone is left upon the other in Chorazin and Bethsaida.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thou, Capernaum</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-13.htm">Matthew 4:13</a>, note), <span class="cmt_word">which art exalted unto heaven;</span> <span class="accented">Shalt thou be exalted unto heaven</span>?

In this verso the stress lies on the effect of the moral attitude; in ver. 21, on the moral attitude itself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:16-24 Christ reflects on the scribes and Pharisees, who had a proud conceit of themselves. He likens their behaviour to children's play, who being out of temper without reason, quarrel with all the attempts of their fellows to please them, or to get them to join in the plays for which they used to assemble. The cavils of worldly men are often very trifling and show great malice. Something they have to urge against every one, however excellent and holy. Christ, who was undefiled, and separate from sinners, is here represented as in league with them, and polluted by them. The most unspotted innocence will not always be a defence against reproach. Christ knew that the hearts of the Jews were more bitter and hardened against his miracles and doctrines, than those of Tyre and Sidon would have been; therefore their condemnation would be the greater. The Lord exercises his almighty power, yet he punishes none more than they deserve, and never withholds the knowledge of the truth from those who long after it.</body></html>
