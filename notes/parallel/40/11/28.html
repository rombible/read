There is less thought of the process of coming than in the very similar invitation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden</span>. The toilers and burdened (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). Our Lord purposely did not define in what the toil and burden consisted; for he would include all, from whatever quarter their toil and burden came. But since the spiritual is the central part of man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>, note), the more that the toil or burden is felt there so much the stronger would our Lord's reference to it be. He would therefore be inviting most especially those that toil in legal ways of righteousness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-2.htm">Romans 10:2, 3</a>), and are burdened under Pharisaic enactments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-46.htm">Luke 11:46</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And I.</span> Emphatic (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;</span>). However others may treat you. <span class="cmt_word">Will</span> <span class="cmt_word">give you rest</span> (<span class="greek_word">a)napau/sw u(ma = </span>). Not to be identified with the phrase in ver. 29 (see there). As contrasted with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> (see Bishop Lightfoot, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-7.htm">Philemon 1:7</a> and on Ignat., 'Ephesians,' &sect; 2), <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> refers to temporary rather than permanent cessation from work, and it thus especially connotes refreshment of body and soul obtained through such rest. In confortuity with this we find <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> regularly used in the LXX. as a translation of <span class="accented">sabbathon</span> ("sabbath-keeping," <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-23.htm">Exodus 16:23</a>, for which <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> comes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9</a> as an equivalent). The thought, therefore, here is not that those who come to Christ will have no more work, but that Christ will give them at once such rest and refreshment of soul that they may be fit for work, should God have any in store for them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:25-30 It becomes children to be grateful. When we come to God as a Father, we must remember that he is Lord of heaven and earth, which obliges us to come to him with reverence as to the sovereign Lord of all; yet with confidence, as one able to defend us from evil, and to supply us with all good. Our blessed Lord added a remarkable declaration, that the Father had delivered into his hands all power, authority, and judgment. We are indebted to Christ for all the revelation we have of God the Father's will and love, ever since Adam sinned. Our Saviour has invited all that labour and are heavy-laden, to come unto him. In some senses all men are so. Worldly men burden themselves with fruitless cares for wealth and honours; the gay and the sensual labour in pursuit of pleasures; the slave of Satan and his own lusts, is the merest drudge on earth. Those who labour to establish their own righteousness also labour in vain. The convinced sinner is heavy-laden with guilt and terror; and the tempted and afflicted believer has labours and burdens. Christ invites all to come to him for rest to their souls. He alone gives this invitation; men come to him, when, feeling their guilt and misery, and believing his love and power to help, they seek him in fervent prayer. Thus it is the duty and interest of weary and heavy-laden sinners, to come to Jesus Christ. This is the gospel call; Whoever will, let him come. All who thus come will receive rest as Christ's gift, and obtain peace and comfort in their hearts. But in coming to him they must take his yoke, and submit to his authority. They must learn of him all things, as to their comfort and obedience. He accepts the willing servant, however imperfect the services. Here we may find rest for our souls, and here only. Nor need we fear his yoke. His commandments are holy, just, and good. It requires self-denial, and exposes to difficulties, but this is abundantly repaid, even in this world, by inward peace and joy. It is a yoke that is lined with love. So powerful are the assistances he gives us, so suitable the encouragements, and so strong the consolations to be found in the way of duty, that we may truly say, it is a yoke of pleasantness. The way of duty is the way of rest. The truths Christ teaches are such as we may venture our souls upon. Such is the Redeemer's mercy; and why should the labouring and burdened sinner seek for rest from any other quarter? Let us come to him daily, for deliverance from wrath and guilt, from sin and Satan, from all our cares, fears, and sorrows. But forced obedience, far from being easy and light, is a heavy burden. In vain do we draw near to Jesus with our lips, while the heart is far from him. Then come to Jesus to find rest for your souls.</body></html>
