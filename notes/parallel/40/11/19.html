Like so many of our Lord's other sayings, the parable stretches far and wide through the ages.

The common reading, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, has come from Luke. In these words lie the chief difficulty of this difficult sentence. <span class="accented">Of</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span>) may be used of agents (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-13.htm">James 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-4.htm">James 5:4</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-18.htm">Luke 6:18</a>, almost as though it were <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span>), but it is more natural to understand it here of the causes or reasons for the verdict. And <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span> thus gives au excellent sense. Our Lord says that the Divine Wisdom is justified in the minds of men from the results she brings about. Of what is he thinking? Doubtless moral results, and probably those found in the change that might be seen in the publicans and sinners of which he has just been speaking. The Divine Wisdom, which appeared to the careless and unsympathetic so strange and changeable in her methods, is, notwithstanding, pronounced to be in the right, because of the results of her activity, the men and the women brought under her influence. These <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-15.htm">Galatians 6:15</a>) are always the best justification of misunderstood plans. While, however, this seems the best interpretation of the sentence as recorded in Matthew, it must be confessed that in Luke it appears more natural to understand "her children" as those who justify her; and further, this was probably St. Luke's own interpretation. For he seems to purposely give an explanation of the apothegm in the verses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-29.htm">Luke 7:29, 30</a>) by which he joins the equivalent of our vers. 16-19 to the equivalent of our ver. 11. He there tells us that all the people and the publicans "justified God," having been baptized with the baptism of John, but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected God's plan towards them, not having been baptized by him. Wisdom's children justified her; others did not. Anyhow, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> would appear to be the more original of the two terms, for with the explanation preferred above, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> would be very easily derived from it. It may, indeed, be due to a more primitive confusion between <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> ("her works," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:1</a>) and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> ("her servants," Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span>), this last word being commonly rendered <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, and, perhaps through <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, even <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> (cf. Reseh, ' Agrapha,' p. 277), but even then it is unlikely that the former and harder reading should be only due to a mistake for the latter. That the harder and metaphorical should be changed into the easier and more literal, even as early as St. Luke's time, appears much more probable. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:16-24 Christ reflects on the scribes and Pharisees, who had a proud conceit of themselves. He likens their behaviour to children's play, who being out of temper without reason, quarrel with all the attempts of their fellows to please them, or to get them to join in the plays for which they used to assemble. The cavils of worldly men are often very trifling and show great malice. Something they have to urge against every one, however excellent and holy. Christ, who was undefiled, and separate from sinners, is here represented as in league with them, and polluted by them. The most unspotted innocence will not always be a defence against reproach. Christ knew that the hearts of the Jews were more bitter and hardened against his miracles and doctrines, than those of Tyre and Sidon would have been; therefore their condemnation would be the greater. The Lord exercises his almighty power, yet he punishes none more than they deserve, and never withholds the knowledge of the truth from those who long after it.</body></html>
