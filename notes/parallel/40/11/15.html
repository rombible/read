A solemn exhortation, often spoken by our Lord at the close of an utterance. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-9.htm">Matthew 13:9</a> (equivalent to <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-9.htm">Mark 4:9</a>), 43; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-23.htm">Mark 4:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-35.htm">Luke 14:35</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-18.htm">Mark 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-44.htm">Luke 9:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2.htm">Revelation 2</a>. and 3; 13:9). It means - You are all formed by nature to learn God's commands; answer, therefore, to your powers, and obey him. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:7-15 What Christ said concerning John, was not only for his praise, but for the people's profit. Those who attend on the word will be called to give an account of their improvements. Do we think when the sermon is done, the care is over? No, then the greatest of the care begins. John was a self-denying man, dead to all the pomps of the world and the pleasures of sense. It becomes people, in all their appearances, to be consistent with their character and their situation. John was a great and good man, yet not perfect; therefore he came short of glorified saints. The least in heaven knows more, loves more, and does more in praising God, and receives more from him, than the greatest in this world. But by the kingdom of heaven here, is rather to be understood the kingdom of grace, the gospel dispensation in its power and purity. What reason we have to be thankful that our lot is cast in the days of the kingdom of heaven, under such advantages of light and love! Multitudes were wrought upon by the ministry of John, and became his disciples. And those strove for a place in this kingdom, that one would think had no right nor title to it, and so seemed to be intruders. It shows us what fervency and zeal are required of all. Self must be denied; the bent, the frame and temper of the mind must be altered. Those who will have an interest in the great salvation, will have it upon any terms, and not think them hard, nor quit their hold without a blessing. The things of God are of great and common concern. God requires no more from us than the right use of the faculties he has given us. People are ignorant, because they will not learn.</body></html>
