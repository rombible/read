The words describe the eager rush of the crowds of Galilee and Judaea, first to the preaching of the Baptist, and then to that of Jesus. It was, as it were, a city attacked on all sides by those who were eager to take possession of it.<p><span class= "bld">The violent take it by force.</span>--The Greek noun is without the article, "men who are violent or use force." The meaning is determined by the preceding clause. The "violent" are men of eager, impetuous zeal, who grasp the kingdom of heaven--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> its peace, and pardon, and blessedness--with as much eagerness as men would snatch and carry off as their own the spoil of a conquered city. Their new life is, in the prophet's language, "given them as a prey" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-9.htm" title="He that stays in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goes out, and falls to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be to him for a prey.">Jeremiah 21:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-5.htm" title="And seek you great things for yourself? seek them not: for, behold, I will bring evil on all flesh, said the LORD: but your life will I give to you for a prey in all places where you go.">Jeremiah 45:5</a>). There is no thought of hostile purpose in the words.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - It is curious that in St. Luke's account of this speech of our Lord's he should omit our vers. 12-14 (on ver. 15, see note there), thus leaving out all Christ's plainer and more direct teaching about the relation of John to himself. St. Luke places (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-16.htm">Luke 16:16</a>) our vers. 12 and 13 in what appears to be merely a cento of sayings. Possibly the original occasion has been recorded by neither evangelist, but in Matthew the passage certainly brings out the thought upon which our Lord was insisting on this occasion. <span class="cmt_word">And</span>. Slightly adversative (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>), for there is a change of subject. Christ urges his hearers to more definitely range themselves under his banner. <span class="cmt_word">From the days of John the Baptist until now</span>. Yet this was not more than a few months! Possibly the sentence had become modified in oral teaching, so as to include many years, say up to A.D. or 60. St. Luke's <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is easy enough. Observe the implied success of John's work as herald. He so prepared the way that men were eager to enter the kingdom which he had said was at hand. <span class="cmt_word">The kingdom of heaven</span>. The realm ruled over by Messiah, of which the then community of believers was the earnest (<span class="accented">vide</span> Introduction, p. 25.). <span class="cmt_word">Suffereth violence</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). In Luke it is middle, "Every man entereth violently into it;" and though it is certainly passive here, St. Luke's phrase compels us to understand the reason of the violence to be entrance into the kingdom. The kingdom is not ill treated, but it is as it were taken by storm (Meyer). Nosgen strangely understands the phrase to mean that the kingdom is set forward with power, and he would apparently see in "the violent" a special reference to our Lord and John. <span class="cmt_word">And the violent</span>; <span class="accented">and men of violence</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>: only they; men whose mind is made up and who care not what force and power they employ to attain their object. <span class="cmt_word">Take it by force</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, "grasp it for themselves," like rough and violent bandits seizing their prey. Weiss sees in this verse blame of the politico-Messianic endeavours to hasten the completion of the kingdom. This explanation is good in itself (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a>), but disconnects the verse from its context. Our Lord is describing the energy with which some souls are pressing in, and urging the need of such energy if salvation is to be obtained. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:7-15 What Christ said concerning John, was not only for his praise, but for the people's profit. Those who attend on the word will be called to give an account of their improvements. Do we think when the sermon is done, the care is over? No, then the greatest of the care begins. John was a self-denying man, dead to all the pomps of the world and the pleasures of sense. It becomes people, in all their appearances, to be consistent with their character and their situation. John was a great and good man, yet not perfect; therefore he came short of glorified saints. The least in heaven knows more, loves more, and does more in praising God, and receives more from him, than the greatest in this world. But by the kingdom of heaven here, is rather to be understood the kingdom of grace, the gospel dispensation in its power and purity. What reason we have to be thankful that our lot is cast in the days of the kingdom of heaven, under such advantages of light and love! Multitudes were wrought upon by the ministry of John, and became his disciples. And those strove for a place in this kingdom, that one would think had no right nor title to it, and so seemed to be intruders. It shows us what fervency and zeal are required of all. Self must be denied; the bent, the frame and temper of the mind must be altered. Those who will have an interest in the great salvation, will have it upon any terms, and not think them hard, nor quit their hold without a blessing. The things of God are of great and common concern. God requires no more from us than the right use of the faculties he has given us. People are ignorant, because they will not learn.</body></html>
