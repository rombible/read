The question comes from him; the answer is sent to him. No difficulty in conceiving how the doubt which the question seems to imply could enter into the mind of the Baptist after the testimony which he had borne and that which he had heard, can warrant us in doing violence to what would seem to be the plain meaning of the history. And the meaning of the question is not far to seek. The sickness of deferred hope turns the full assurance of faith into something like despair. So of old Jeremiah had complained, in the bitterness of his spirit, that Jehovah had deceived him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-7.htm" title="O LORD, you have deceived me, and I was deceived; you are stronger than I, and have prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocks me.">Jeremiah 20:7</a>). So now the Baptist, as week after week passed without the appearance of the kingdom as he expected it to appear, felt as if the King was deserting the forerunner and herald of His kingdom. The very wonders of which he heard made the feeling more grievous, for they seemed to give proof of the power, and to leave him to the conclusion that the will was wanting. And so he sends his disciples with the question, which is one of impatience rather than doubt, "Art Thou the coming One of whom the prophets spoke" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-7.htm" title="Then said I, See, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,">Psalm 40:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-26.htm" title="Blessed be he that comes in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.">Psalm 118:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm" title="Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom you seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom you delight in: behold, he shall come, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:1</a>)? but if so, why tarry the wheels of Thy chariot? Are we still to look for another and a different Christ?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And said unto him</span>. The question was brought from John; the answer is sent back to him (ver. 4). This points to the cause of the question lying ultimately, not with his disciples, but with himself. Although John might justly fear that they would follow him rather than Jesus (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-14.htm">Matthew 9:14</a>, note), yet he seems to have made this inquiry for his own sake. He who stood on the Jewish side of the threshold of the kingdom (ver. 11) did not understand the methods by which the King was acting, and thus his faith was tried (comp. Tertullian, 'Adv. Marc.,' 4:18). In this he recalls his great prototype, whose plans seemed to have failed and his boldness to have done no good (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-13.htm">1 Kings 19:13, 14</a>). To both the answer implied that success was assured to quiet spiritual work. <span class="cmt_word">Art thou</span> (emphatic) <span class="cmt_word">he that should come?</span> he <span class="accented">that cometh</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a>, note). The title was probably derived from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-26.htm">Psalm 118:26</a>, and would become the more known from the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-37.htm">Hebrews 10:37</a>), and perhaps also from a directly Messianic interpretation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Or do we look for</span>. The word (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) contains no thought of looking about for, but only of earnest expectation. <span class="cmt_word">Another?</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f1d;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-19.htm">Luke 7:19</a>; but <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-20.htm">Luke 7:20</a> (where, however, Westcott and Heft margin reads <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). Observe that in both records the evangelist's own summary of John's message speaks of a difference in kind, but that in the form given by the messengers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-20.htm">Luke 7:20</a>) it is only a matter of a second person coming (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-8.htm">1 Corinthians 12:8</a>, etc.; 1 Corinthians 15:39, etc.). John's disciples, that is to say, are represented as failing to catch the point of their master's question whether he must look, after all, for a Messiah who acts differently from the way in which Jesus acts. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:2-6 Some think that John sent this inquiry for his own satisfaction. Where there is true faith, yet there may be a mixture of unbelief. The remaining unbelief of good men may sometimes, in an hour of temptation; call in question the most important truths. But we hope that John's faith did not fail in this matter, and that he only desired to have it strengthened and confirmed. Others think that John sent his disciples to Christ for their satisfaction. Christ points them to what they heard and saw. Christ's gracious condescensions and compassions to the poor, show that it was he that should bring to the world the tender mercies of our God. Those things which men see and hear, if compared with the Scriptures, direct in what way salvation is to be found. It is difficult to conquer prejudices, and dangerous not to conquer them; but those who believe in Christ, their faith will be found so much the more to praise, and honour, and glory.</body></html>
