The verb, both here and ver. 37, is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, which implies, not mere animal or worldly affection (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>), but love from the highest moral considerations, without self-interest, holy. The Latins indicated this difference by <span class="accented">amo</span> and <span class="accented">diligo.</span> Our "neighbour" is every one with whom we are concerned, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> virtually all men. He is to be loved because he is God's image and likeness, heir of the same hope as we ourselves, and presented to us as the object on and by which we are to show the reality of our love to God. "This commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God love his brother also" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-21.htm">1 John 4:21</a>). And for the measure of our love to man, we have Christ's word in another place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>), "All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:34-40 An interpreter of the law asked our Lord a question, to try, not so much his knowledge, as his judgment. The love of God is the first and great commandment, and the sum of all the commands of the first table. Our love of God must be sincere, not in word and tongue only. All our love is too little to bestow upon him, therefore all the powers of the soul must be engaged for him, and carried out toward him. To love our neighbour as ourselves, is the second great commandment. There is a self-love which is corrupt, and the root of the greatest sins, and it must be put off and mortified; but there is a self-love which is the rule of the greatest duty: we must have a due concern for the welfare of our own souls and bodies. And we must love our neighbour as truly and sincerely as we love ourselves; in many cases we must deny ourselves for the good of others. By these two commandments let our hearts be formed as by a mould.</body></html>
