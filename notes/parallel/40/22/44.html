The quotation is from the Septuagint. But neither this nor our English Version is an adequate rendering of the original, where the word translated "Lord" is not the same in both parts of the clause, More accurately, the solemn beginning of the psalm is thus given: "Utterance [or, 'oracle'] of Jehovah to my Lord (<span class="accented">Adonai</span>)." The psalmist acknowledges the recipient of the utterance as his sovereign Lord; this could be no earthly potentate, for on earth he had no such superior; Jewish tradition always applied the term unto the Messiah, or the Word. The prediction repeats the promise made by Nathan to David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12</a>), which had no fulfilment in his natural progeny, and could be regarded as looking forward only to the Messiah. <span class="cmt_word">Sit thou on my right</span> <span class="cmt_word">hand.</span> Thus Messiah is exalted to the highest dignity in heaven. Sitting at God's right hand does not necessarily imply complete Divine majesty (as Hengstenberg remarks), for the sons of Zebedee had asked for such a position in Messiah's earthly kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-21.htm">Matthew 20:21</a>); but it denotes supreme honour, association in government, authority second only to that of Monarch. This is said of Christ in his human nature. He is "equal to the Father, as touching his Godhead; inferior to the Father, as touching his manhood." In his Divine nature he could receive nothing; in his human nature all "power was given unto him in heaven and earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Till I</span> <span class="cmt_word">make</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1ff7;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">thine</span> <span class="cmt_word">enemies thy footstool;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. This is the Septuagint reading.

Vulgate, <span class="accented">Donec ponam inimicos tuos scabellum pedum tuorum.</span> The complete subjection of all adversaries is denoted (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-25.htm">1 Corinthians 15:25-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-13.htm">Hebrews 1:13</a>); and they are subjected not merely for punishment and destruction, but, it may be, for salvation and glory. The relative particle "till" must not be pressed, as if Christ's session was to cease when his victory was completed. We have before had occasion to observe that the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span>, asserts nothing of the future beyond the event specified. As St. Jerome says of such negative phrases, "Ita negant praeteritum ut non ponant futurum" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-25.htm">Matthew 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-26.htm">Matthew 5:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-34.htm">Matthew 18:34</a>). Of Christ's kingdom there is no end. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:41-46 When Christ baffled his enemies, he asked what thoughts they had of the promised Messiah? How he could be the Son of David and yet his Lord? He quotes Ps 110:1. If the Christ was to be a mere man, who would not exist till many ages after David's death, how could his forefather call him Lord? The Pharisees could not answer it. Nor can any solve the difficulty except he allows the Messiah to be the Son of God, and David's Lord equally with the Father. He took upon him human nature, and so became God manifested in the flesh; in this sense he is the Son of man and the Son of David. It behoves us above all things seriously to inquire, What think we of Christ? Is he altogether glorious in our eyes, and precious to our hearts? May Christ be our joy, our confidence, our all. May we daily be made more like to him, and more devoted to his service.</body></html>
