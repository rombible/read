In their ethical teaching the Pharisees had grasped the truth intellectually, though they did not realise it in their lives, and our Lord did not shrink, therefore, so far, from identifying His teaching with theirs. Truth was truth, even though it was held by the Pharisees and coupled with hypocrisy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt love the Lord thy God;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, from the Septuagint, with some slight variation). Christ enunciates the two great moral precepts of God's Law, not, indeed, stated in these words in the Decalogue, but implied throughout, and forming the basis of true religion. <span class="cmt_word">Heart... soul... mind.</span> The Septuagint has "mind, soul, strength." The expressions mean generally that God is to be loved with all our powers and faculties, and that nothing is to be preferred to him. It is difficult to define with any precision the signification of each term used, and much unprofitable labour has been expended in the endeavour to limit their exact sense. "Quum," as Grotius says, "vocum multarum cumulatio nihil quam intensius studium designet." It is usual to explain thus: <span class="accented">Heart</span>; which among the Hebrews was considered to be the seat of the understanding, is here considered as the home of the affections and the seat of the will. <span class="accented">Soul</span>; the living powers, the animal life. <span class="accented">Mind</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>, intellectual powers. These are to be the seat and abode of the love enjoined. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:34-40 An interpreter of the law asked our Lord a question, to try, not so much his knowledge, as his judgment. The love of God is the first and great commandment, and the sum of all the commands of the first table. Our love of God must be sincere, not in word and tongue only. All our love is too little to bestow upon him, therefore all the powers of the soul must be engaged for him, and carried out toward him. To love our neighbour as ourselves, is the second great commandment. There is a self-love which is corrupt, and the root of the greatest sins, and it must be put off and mortified; but there is a self-love which is the rule of the greatest duty: we must have a due concern for the welfare of our own souls and bodies. And we must love our neighbour as truly and sincerely as we love ourselves; in many cases we must deny ourselves for the good of others. By these two commandments let our hearts be formed as by a mould.</body></html>
