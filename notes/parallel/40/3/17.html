It was a testimony to them, and not to the multitude. The precise force of the latter clause, <span class= "ital">in whom I was well pleased,</span> points (to speak after the manner of men) rather to a definite divine act or thought, than to a continued ever-present acceptance. He who stood there was the beloved Son, in whom, "in the beginning," the Father was well-pleased. To the Baptist this came as the answer to all questionings. This was none other than the King to whom had been spoken the words, <span class= "ital">"</span>Thou art my Son" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm" title="I will declare the decree: the LORD has said to me, You are my Son; this day have I begotten you.">Psalm 2:7</a>), who was to the Eternal Father what Isaac was to Abraham (the very term "beloved son" is used in the Greek of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-2.htm" title="And he said, Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and get you into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.">Genesis 22:2</a>, where the English version has "only"), upon whom the mind of the Father rested with infinite content. And we may venture to believe that the "voice" came as an attestation also to the human consciousness of the Son of Man. There had been before, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-49.htm" title="And he said to them, How is it that you sought me? knew you not that I must be about my Father's business?">Luke 2:49</a>, the sense that God was His Father. Now, with an intensity before unfelt, and followed, as the sequel shows, with entire change in life and action, there is, in His human soul, the conviction that He is "<span class= "ital">the</span> Son, <span class= "ital">the</span> beloved."<p>Here, as before, it is instructive to note the legendary accretions that have gathered round the simple narrative of the Gospels. Justin (<span class= "ital">Dial.</span> c., <span class= "ital">Tryph.</span> p. 316) adds that "a fire was kindled in Jordan." An Ebionite Gospel added to the words from heaven, "This day have I begotten thee," and further adds, "a great light shone around the place, and John saw it, and said, 'Who art thou, Lord?' and again a voice from heaven, saying. 'This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.' And then John fell down, and said, 'I beseech Thee, O Lord, baptise Thou me.' But He forbade him, saying, 'Suffer it, for thus it is meet that all things should be accomplished.'<p>More important and more difficult is the question, What change was actually wrought in our Lord's human nature by this descent of the Spirit? The words of the Baptist, "He giveth not the Spirit by measure unto Him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-34.htm" title="For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God: for God gives not the Spirit by measure to him.">John 3:34</a>) imply the bestowal of a real gift. The words that follow here, "He was led by the Spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-1.htm" title="Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.">Matthew 4:1</a>), "The Spirit driveth Him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-12.htm" title="And immediately the spirit drives him into the wilderness.">Mark 1:12</a>), show, in part, the nature of the change. We may venture to think even there of new gifts, new powers, a new intuition (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-11.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and you receive not our witness.">John 3:11</a>), a new constraint, as it were, bringing the human will that was before in harmony with the divine into a fuller consciousness of that harmony, and into more intense activity; above all, a new intensity of prayer, uttering itself in Him, as afterwards in His people, in the cry, "Abba, Father" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-36.htm" title="And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to you; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what you will.">Mark 14:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm" title="For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but you have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.">Romans 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm" title="And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.">Galatians 4:6</a>). There also we may think of the Spirit as "making intercession with groanings that cannot be uttered."<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lo</span>; peculiar to St. Matthew - a reminiscence of Aramaic diction. <span class="cmt_word">A voice</span>. Similarly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a> (Transfiguration, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-17.htm">2 Peter 1:17, 18</a>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-28.htm">John 12:28</a> (like thunder); [possibly <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-6.htm">Acts 2:6</a>, Pentecost]; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a> (Paul's conversion); 10:13, 15 (Peter). Talmudic and rabbinic writings often mention the Bath-Qol as speaking from heaven. The character of the occasions on which the voice is heard in the New Testament on the one hand, and in the Jewish writings on the other, shows the complete difference in the moral aspect of the two voices. The latter is at best little more than a parody of the former. (For the meaning of the expression Bath-Qol <span class="accented">vide</span> especially Weber, p. 188; Edersheim, 'Life,' 1:285.) <span class="cmt_word">From</span> <span class="cmt_word">heaven</span>; <span class="accented">out of the heavens</span> (Revised Version), pointing to the phrase in ver. 16. <span class="cmt_word">Saying</span>. Western authorities add, "unto him," mostly reading the following words in the second person (cf. Mark and Luke). <span class="cmt_word">This is my beloved Son</span>. Very similar if not identical words were spoken at the Transfiguration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>), Matthew giving precisely the same, Mark and Luke only omitting "in whom I am well pleased," and Luke also reading "chosen" instead of "beloved." It would seem more natural to suppose that the words spoken on the two occasions were really slightly different, and that therefore Matthew is the less accurate. <span class="accented">My</span> .... <span class="accented">Son</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>). <span class="accented">My beloved Son.</span> The expression is probably based on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a> (cf. <span class="accented">infra</span>, Matthew 12:18, note); but this does not necessitate the punctuation of the Revised Version margin, and Westcott and Herr margin: "My Son; my beloved in whom," etc. (For the expression, comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-6.htm">Mark 12:6</a> (not in the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-37.htm">Matthew 21:37</a>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-6.htm">Ephesians 1:6</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">In whom I am well pleased;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in whom I have delight</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-4.htm">Isaiah 62:4</a>, Authorized Version). The tense (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>) is equivalent to "my delight" fell on him, he became the object of my love" (Winer, 40:5, b, 2). The Spirit came, the Father bore witness. "Thus the Baptist receives through a revelation the certainty of the Messiahship of Jesus, and thus the reader learns that the Son of David, who through his birth (ch. 1.) and the fortunes of his childhood (ch. 2.) was certified as the Messiah, now also is announced to the last of the prophets as the Son of God, to whom Jehovah, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, etc., had promised the Messianic dominion of the world" (Weiss, 'Matthaus-Evang.'). Yet not only so; the words probably revealed to the Lord Jesus himself more of his exact relationship to the Father than he had before as Man realized. Such an assurance of his true nature, and of the Father's delight in him, would be of essential service in strengthening him for his work (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>). There are two other matters connected with our Lord's baptism recorded by tradition (cf. especially Resch, 'Agrapha,'pp. 346-367)-additional words spoken, and an additional sign given. The words spoken are found in "Western" authorities of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-22.htm">Luke 3:22</a>, "Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee," evidently with a desire to emphasize the application of the second psalm. The additional sign is the light or fire. The simplest form of this is (Tatian's 'Diatessaron,' edit. Zahn), "A light rose upon the waters;" and in the Ebionite Gospel apud Epiph., "Immediately a great light shone round about the place;" more fully in Justin Martyr ('Trypho,' &sect; 88), "When Jesus had gone down into the water, fire was kindled in the Jordan;" also in a now lost 'Pred. Paul,' "When he was being baptized, fire was seen upon the water;" and in the Cod. Vercellensis of the Old Latin, "When he was being baptized, an immense light shone round from the water, so that all who had come thither were afraid." Although there is no intrinsic objection to this symbol having taken place, it is very improbable that in this case the evangelists would not have recorded it. The legend may have arisen from ver. 11, or, and more probably, from an endeavour to make the baptism parallel to the Transfiguration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>); cf. Ephraem, in Resch ('Agrapha,' p. 358), "John drew near and worshipped the Son, whose form an unwonted lustre surrounded." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:13-17 Christ's gracious condescensions are so surprising, that even the strongest believers at first can hardly believe them; so deep and mysterious, that even those who know his mind well, are apt to start objections against the will of Christ. And those who have much of the Spirit of God while here, see that they need to apply to Christ for more. Christ does not deny that John had need to be baptized of him, yet declares he will now be baptized of John. Christ is now in a state of humiliation. Our Lord Jesus looked upon it as well becoming him to fulfil all righteousness, to own every Divine institution, and to show his readiness to comply with all God's righteous precepts. In and through Christ, the heavens are opened to the children of men. This descent of the Spirit upon Christ, showed that he was endued with his sacred influences without measure. The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance. At Christ's baptism there was a manifestation of the three Persons in the sacred Trinity. The Father confirming the Son to be Mediator; the Son solemnly entering upon the work; the Holy Spirit descending on him, to be through his mediation communicated to his people. In Him our spiritual sacrifices are acceptable, for He is the altar that sanctifies every gift, 1Pe 2:5. Out of Christ, God is a consuming fire, but in Christ, a reconciled Father. This is the sum of the gospel, which we must by faith cheerfully embrace.</body></html>
