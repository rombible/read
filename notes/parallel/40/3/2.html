In the Greek version of the Old Testament, the word is used of divine rather than human repentance, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> of a change of purpose implying pity and regret (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-29.htm" title="And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.">1Samuel 15:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-28.htm" title="For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.">Jeremiah 4:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-8.htm" title="If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them.">Jeremiah 18:8</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/5-3.htm" title="And they repenting and groaning for anguish of spirit shall say within themselves, This was he, whom we had sometimes in derision, and a proverb of reproach:">Wisdom Of Solomon 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/17-24.htm" title="But unto them that repent, he granted them return, and comforted those that failed in patience.">Ecclesiasticus 17:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/48-15.htm" title="For all this the people repented not, neither departed they from their sins, till they were spoiled and carried out of their land, and were scattered through all the earth: yet there remained a small people, and a ruler in the house of David:">Ecclesiasticus 48:15</a>, it includes the sorrow out of which the change comes.<p><span class= "bld">The kingdom of heaven.</span>--The phrase is used by St. Matthew about thirty times, and by him only among the New Testament writers. In the Greek the form is plural, "the kingdom of the heavens," probably as an equivalent for the Hebrew word, which was dual in its form. The name, as descriptive of the kingdom of the Messiah, had its origin in the vision of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a>, where the kingdom of "one like the Son of Man" is contrasted with those of earthly rulers. To Gentile readers--to whom the term would convey the thought of the visible firmament, not of the invisible dwelling-place of God--the term might have been misleading, and therefore in the Gospels intended for them "the kingdom of God" (which occurs sometimes in St. Matthew also, 6:13; 12:28) is used instead of it. It is probable that both terms were used interchangeably by the Baptist and our Lord, and the systematic change is suggestive as showing that the writers of the Gospels did not feel themselves bound to a purely literal report or rendering of their words.<p><span class= "bld">Is at hand.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">has come nigh.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (omitted by the Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">saying</span>. The parallel passages give the substance of John's preaching - the baptism of repentance. St. Matthew takes, as it seems, a sentence that actually fell from his lips, and presents it as the kernel of his message ("preaching... saying"). This is the more interesting as nowhere else are we told any words uttered by him in this the first stage of his ministry before crowds flocked to hear him. <span class="cmt_word">Repent ye... at hand</span>; said word for word by our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>, note). <span class="accented">Repent ye</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) . The word expresses the central thought of true repentance, in speaking, as it does, of a change of mind. Contrast <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-3.htm">Matthew 27:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-8.htm">2 Corinthians 7:8-10</a>). As such it goes deeper than the Old Testament summons "Turn ye" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;</span>), or the rabbinic <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5d4;</span>, for it points out in what part of man the alteration must be. (On <span class="accented">your</span> meaning more than the mere thinking power, and including also the willing faculty, cf. especially Delitzsch, 'Psych.,' p. 211, etc., Eng. trans., 1875.) It is noticeable that the LXX. never, as it seems, translate <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, but often <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d7;&#x5dd;</span> (of man only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-6.htm">Jeremiah 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-19.htm">Jeremiah 31:19</a>; and <span class="accented">possibly</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-14.htm">Joel 2:14</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-29.htm">1 Samuel 15:29</a>), which refers to repentance as a matter of feeling. As Messiah was coming, it was only natural that John should urge repentance. Similarly, we find late Jewish writers expounding <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, "'And the Spirit of God was moving [on the face of the waters].' This is the Spirit of King Messiah, like that which is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, 'And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him.' By what kind of merit does it draw near and come? It says, 'upon the face of the waters.' By the merit of repentance, which is compared to water, as it is written (Lain. 2:19), 'Pour out thy heart like water'" ('Bresh. R.,' &sect; 2). But, unfortunately, they assign far too legal a meaning to the word, and their phrase, "do repentance" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e9;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5d4;</span>), becomes almost identical with the "do penance" (<span class="accented">poeni-tentiam agite</span>, Vulgate) of the Roman Catholics (cf. Talm. Dab., 'Sanh.,' 97 b). <span class="cmt_word">For the kingdom of heaven</span> (see Introduction, p. 22.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 After Malachi there was no prophet until John the Baptist came. He appeared first in the wilderness of Judea. This was not an uninhabited desert, but a part of the country not thickly peopled, nor much enclosed. No place is so remote as to shut us out from the visits of Divine grace. The doctrine he preached was repentance; Repent ye. The word here used, implies a total alteration in the mind, a change in the judgment, disposition, and affections, another and a better bias of the soul. Consider your ways, change your minds: you have thought amiss; think again, and think aright. True penitents have other thoughts of God and Christ, sin and holiness, of this world and the other, than they had. The change of the mind produces a change of the way. That is gospel repentance, which flows from a sight of Christ, from a sense of his love, and from hopes of pardon and forgiveness through him. It is a great encouragement to us to repent; repent, for your sins shall be pardoned upon your repentance. Return to God in a way of duty, and he will, through Christ, return unto you in the way of mercy. It is still as necessary to repent and humble ourselves, to prepare the way of the Lord, as it then was. There is a great deal to be done, to make way for Christ into a soul, and nothing is more needful than the discovery of sin, and a conviction that we cannot be saved by our own righteousness. The way of sin and Satan is a crooked way; but to prepare a way for Christ, the paths must be made straight, Heb 12:13. Those whose business it is to call others to mourn for sin, and to mortify it, ought themselves to live a serious life, a life of self-denial, and contempt of the world. By giving others this example, John made way for Christ. Many came to John's baptism, but few kept to the profession they made. There may be many forward hearers, where there are few true believers. Curiosity, and love for novelty and variety, may bring many to attend on good preaching, and to be affected for a while, who never are subject to the power of it. Those who received John's doctrine, testified their repentance by confessing their sins. Those only are ready to receive Jesus Christ as their righteousness, who are brought with sorrow and shame to own their guilt. The benefits of the kingdom of heaven, now at hand, were thereupon sealed to them by baptism. John washed them with water, in token that God would cleanse them from all their iniquities, thereby intimating, that by nature and practice all were polluted, and could not be admitted among the people of God, unless washed from their sins in the fountain Christ was to open, Zec 13:1.</body></html>
