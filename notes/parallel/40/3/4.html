They are commonly salted and dried, and may be cooked in various ways, pounded, or fried in butter, and they taste like shrimps. It is needless, when the facts are so clear, to go out of the way to seek the food of the Baptist in the sweet pods of the so-called locust-tree (<span class= "ital">Ceratonia Siliqua</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> with which it has been sometimes identified. The "wild honey" was that found in the hollows of trees (as in the history of Jonathan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-25.htm" title="And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey on the ground.">1Samuel 14:25</a>), or in the "rocks" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-13.htm" title="He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-16.htm" title="He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied you.">Psalm 81:16</a>). Stress is laid on the simplicity of the Baptist's fare, requiring no skill or appliances, the food of the poorest wanderer in the wilderness, presenting a marked contrast to the luxury of the dwellers in towns. The life of Banus, the hermit-master of Josephus, who lived only on herbs and water (<span class= "ital">Life, c.</span> 2) presented analogous though not identical features.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - With this verse we begin to meet with matter peculiar to Matthew and Mark. <span class="cmt_word">And the same John</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3c9;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>).

Used for food in the East from the remotest times until now. Four kinds are permitted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-22.htm">Leviticus 11:22</a>. "The wings and legs are torn off, and the remainder is sprinkled with salt, and either boiled or eaten roasted" (Meyer). They are mentioned in Talm. Bab., 'Ab. Zar.,' 4:0 b, as being sold after preservation in wine. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> forbids the identification of these locusts with the pods of the carob, or locust tree, such as the prodigal son would fain have eaten. It seems that Jewish Christians of Essene and therefore vegetarian tendencies read <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> (cakes) here. Such at least is the most natural meaning, accepted by Epiphanius, of a quotation which he gives from the Ebionite Gospel according to the Hebrews (<span class="accented">vide</span> Tischendorf, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) (On the theory that John the Baptist was an Essene, cf. Bishop Lightfoot, 'Colossians,' p, 161, edit. 1875.) <span class="cmt_word">And wild honey</span>. This apparently simple phrase is, notwithstanding, of doubtful interpretation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Probably the honey of wild bees. This is still to be found in trees and rocks, and must have been much more common before the greater part of the timber was cut down (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-8.htm">Judges 14:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-25.htm">1 Samuel 14:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-16.htm">Psalm 81:16</a>). Bee-keeping was a favourite pursuit of the Essenes (Philo, 2. p. 633), and the Talmud has frequent notices of hives and the methods of taking bees, etc. (<span class="accented">vide</span> Hamburger, 'Real-Encyc,' 1. <span class="accented">s.v</span>. "Biene"). Hence the need for the addition of some such epithet as "wild," although there seems to be no independent parallel instance of the exact word used (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); cf. Pliny's "mel silvestre." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Possibly "tree-honey" (so Weiss, 'Marc.,' p. 44; 'Life,' 1:308), a sweet vegetable juice obtained from dates (<span class="accented">vide</span> Josephus, <span class="accented">infra</span>) and grapes (as probably in Gem 43:11; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-17.htm">Ezekiel 27:17</a>), and perhaps directly from wild trees, such as the manna ash and the tamarisk. So distinctly Suidas (A.D. 1100). "The forerunner ate locusts and wild honey, which is gathered together from the trees, and is commonly called manna." Diodorus Siculus ( <span class="date">B.C. 8</span>) seems to use the epithet "wild" (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) to distinguish this vegetable honey from that commonly in use (cf. Nicholson, 'Gosp. Hebrews,' p. 35). Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 4:08. 3) states that in the plain watered by the fountain of Jericho, "there are many sorts of palm trees watered by it, different from each other in taste and name; the better sort of them, when they are pressed, yield an excellent kind of honey (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>), not much inferior to other honey. This country withal produces honey from bees (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>)." But the former interpretation seems the more probable. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 After Malachi there was no prophet until John the Baptist came. He appeared first in the wilderness of Judea. This was not an uninhabited desert, but a part of the country not thickly peopled, nor much enclosed. No place is so remote as to shut us out from the visits of Divine grace. The doctrine he preached was repentance; Repent ye. The word here used, implies a total alteration in the mind, a change in the judgment, disposition, and affections, another and a better bias of the soul. Consider your ways, change your minds: you have thought amiss; think again, and think aright. True penitents have other thoughts of God and Christ, sin and holiness, of this world and the other, than they had. The change of the mind produces a change of the way. That is gospel repentance, which flows from a sight of Christ, from a sense of his love, and from hopes of pardon and forgiveness through him. It is a great encouragement to us to repent; repent, for your sins shall be pardoned upon your repentance. Return to God in a way of duty, and he will, through Christ, return unto you in the way of mercy. It is still as necessary to repent and humble ourselves, to prepare the way of the Lord, as it then was. There is a great deal to be done, to make way for Christ into a soul, and nothing is more needful than the discovery of sin, and a conviction that we cannot be saved by our own righteousness. The way of sin and Satan is a crooked way; but to prepare a way for Christ, the paths must be made straight, Heb 12:13. Those whose business it is to call others to mourn for sin, and to mortify it, ought themselves to live a serious life, a life of self-denial, and contempt of the world. By giving others this example, John made way for Christ. Many came to John's baptism, but few kept to the profession they made. There may be many forward hearers, where there are few true believers. Curiosity, and love for novelty and variety, may bring many to attend on good preaching, and to be affected for a while, who never are subject to the power of it. Those who received John's doctrine, testified their repentance by confessing their sins. Those only are ready to receive Jesus Christ as their righteousness, who are brought with sorrow and shame to own their guilt. The benefits of the kingdom of heaven, now at hand, were thereupon sealed to them by baptism. John washed them with water, in token that God would cleanse them from all their iniquities, thereby intimating, that by nature and practice all were polluted, and could not be admitted among the people of God, unless washed from their sins in the fountain Christ was to open, Zec 13:1.</body></html>
