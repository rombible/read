The metaphor was a sufficiently familiar one. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-18.htm" title="They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carries away.">Job 21:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-4.htm" title="The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.">Psalm 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-5.htm" title="Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase them.">Psalm 35:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-13.htm" title="The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.">Isaiah 17:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-5.htm" title="Moreover the multitude of your strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passes away: yes, it shall be at an instant suddenly.">Isaiah 29:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-3.htm" title="Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dew that passes away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.">Hosea 13:3</a>.) The new features here are (1) that the "coming One," the expected Christ, is to be the agent in the process; (2) that the Old Testament imagery rests in the "scattering" of the chaff, and this passes on to the "burning"; (3) that the fire is said to be "unquenched," or perhaps "unquenchable." The interpretation of the parable lies on the surface. The chaff are the ungodly and evildoers. The unquenched fire is the wrath of God against evil, which is, in its very nature, eternal, and can only cease with the cessation or transformation of the evil. The word translated "chaff" includes, it may be noted, straw as well, all but the actual grain.<p>It seems right briefly to direct the reader's thoughts here to what is recorded of the Baptist's ministry in the other Gospels; the questions of the priests and Levites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-19.htm" title="And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?">John 1:19-25</a>); the counsels given to publicans, soldiers, and others (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/3-10.htm" title="And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?">Luke 3:10-14</a>); the presence, among the crowd, of Galileans, some of whom were afterwards Apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-35.htm" title="Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;">John 1:35-42</a>). A curious legendary addition, found in the Apocryphal Gospel according to the Hebrews, is worth noting, as preparing the way for what follows: "Behold, the mother of the Lord and his brethren said unto Him, 'John the Baptist baptiseth for the remission of sins; let us go that we may be baptised by him.' But He said unto them, 'In what have I sinned that I should go and be baptised by him? unless, perhaps, even that which I have thus spoken be a sin of ignorance.' "This was obviously an attempt to explain the difficulty of the Sinless One seeking a baptism of repentance. It was, of course, probable enough that the household of Nazareth, cherishing, as they did, hopes of the kingdom of heaven, should be drawn with other Galileans to the Baptist's preaching.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whose fan</span>. The pronged winnowing-fork (see Pal. Expl. Fund Statem; Ap. 1891) which throws up the grain against the wind. The Coming One is to put an end to the present mixture of chaff and corn. He will thoroughly purge the threshing-floor of this world, gathering the good into one safe place, and destroying the evil. The figure of winnowing comes not unseldom in the Old Testament (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-7.htm">Jeremiah 15:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-2.htm">Jeremiah 51:2</a>), but generally with the sole idea of destruction of the ungodly, <span class="accented">not</span> with that of separating so as to also preserve the godly (yet cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-3.htm">Psalm 139:3</a>, margin; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-9.htm">Amos 9:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Is in his hand</span>. The figure is stronger than that in ver. 10, where the instrument was only lying ready to be taken up. But that was an instrument of destruction alone. <span class="cmt_word">And he will throughly purge</span>; <span class="accented">cleanse</span> (Revised Version); <span class="accented">permundo</span> (Vulgate); <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, the preposition is intensive, not local. <span class="cmt_word">His</span>. Observe the threefold <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, referring to hand, flour, corn - personal agency, sphere, ownership. In the Vatican and some other manuscripts it is found also after "garner;" but this is, perhaps, introduced from the parallel in Luke. <span class="cmt_word">Floor</span>; <span class="accented">threshing-floor</span> (Revised Version). Not the barn that English-men think of, but an open and level space (for the figure, cf. especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-12.htm">Micah 4:12</a>). Here the threshing-floor is equivalent to the scene of the Lord's operations, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the world, or rather the universe (cf. Epbraem (? Tartan) in Resch, 'Agrapha,' p. 295). The present mixture of good and evil shall be brought to an end. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> gather together, from different parts of the threshing-floor, or from intimate association with the chaff, into one heap. All true believers shall finally be brought to perfect unity (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-30.htm">Matthew 13:30</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His wheat</span>. The term is adopted by Ignatius ('Ram.,' &sect;4): "I am the wheat of God, and I am ground by the teeth of wild beasts, that I may be found pure bread [of Christ]." <span class="cmt_word">Into the</span> <span class="cmt_word">garner</span>. The final home of the saints, hidden away and safe from all marauders. Garners in the East are generally subterranean vaults or eaves (but cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-18.htm">Luke 12:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But will burn up</span>. Utterly consuming it (contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>), as the tares (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-30.htm">Matthew 13:30, 40</a>) and the books of magic (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-19.htm">Acts 19:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The chaff</span>. For, as Jeremiah says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-28.htm">Jeremiah 23:28</a>) when comparing a mere dream with a message from the Lord," What is the chaff to the wheat?" The Targum even interprets Jeremiah's words of the wicked and the righteous. The <span class="accented">chaff</span> in Jeremiah includes the straw, for in the East everything except the actual grain is generally burnt, and is sometimes used for heating fireplaces (Mishna, 'Sabb.,' 3:1; 'Parah,' 4:3). <span class="cmt_word">With</span> <span class="cmt_word">unquenchable fire</span>. "Unquenchable" shows that John is here thinking not of the figure of <span class="accented">chaff</span> but of the persons figured by it. But what does the word mean? In itself it might mean that the fire cannot be overcome by the greatness or the nature of the mass that it has to consume; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to drop the figure, by either the number or the character at' the wicked. But from its usage it seems rather to be equivalent to not being overcome by the lapse of time. It is used, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, of the perpetual fire of Vesta, of the fire of the Magi, of the fire upon the Jewish altar (<span class="accented">vide</span> references in Thayer). The whole expression in itself says nothing about the everlasting duration of the punishment; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it does not decide for "everlasting punishment" or for "annihilation," but seems rather to exclude the possibility of amelioration under it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-31.htm">Isaiah 1:31</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:7-12 To make application to the souls of the hearers, is the life of preaching; so it was of John's preaching. The Pharisees laid their chief stress on outward observances, neglecting the weightier matters of the moral law, and the spiritual meaning of their legal ceremonies. Others of them were detestable hypocrites, making their pretences to holiness a cloak for iniquity. The Sadducees ran into the opposite extreme, denying the existence of spirits, and a future state. They were the scornful infidels of that time and country. There is a wrath to come. It is the great concern of every one to flee from that wrath. God, who delights not in our ruin, has warned us; he warns by the written word, by ministers, by conscience. And those are not worthy of the name of penitents, or their privileges, who say they are sorry for their sins, yet persist in them. It becomes penitents to be humble and low in their own eyes, to be thankful for the least mercy, patient under the greatest affliction, to be watchful against all appearances of sin, to abound in every duty, and to be charitable in judging others. Here is a word of caution, not to trust in outward privileges. There is a great deal which carnal hearts are apt to say within themselves, to put aside the convincing, commanding power of the word of God. Multitudes, by resting in the honours and mere advantages of their being members of an outward church, come short of heaven. Here is a word of terror to the careless and secure. Our corrupt hearts cannot be made to produce good fruit, unless the regenerating Spirit of Christ graft the good word of God upon them. And every tree, however high in gifts and honours, however green in outward professions and performances, if it bring not forth good fruit, the fruits meet for repentance, is hewn down and cast into the fire of God's wrath, the fittest place for barren trees: what else are they good for? If not fit for fruit, they are fit for fuel. John shows the design and intention of Christ's appearing, which they were now speedily to expect. No outward forms can make us clean. No ordinances, by whomsoever administered, or after whatever mode, can supply the want of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and of fire. The purifying and cleansing power of the Holy Spirit alone can produce that purity of heart, and those holy affections, which accompany salvation. It is Christ who baptizes with the Holy Ghost. This he did in the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit sent upon the apostles, Ac 2:4. This he does in the graces and comforts of the Spirit, given to those that ask him, Lu 11:13; Joh 7:38,39; see Ac 11:16. Observe here, the outward church is Christ's floor, Isa 21:10. True believers are as wheat, substantial, useful, and valuable; hypocrites are as chaff, light and empty, useless and worthless, carried about with every wind; these are mixed, good and bad, in the same outward communion. There is a day coming when the wheat and chaff shall be separated. The last judgment will be the distinguishing day, when saints and sinners shall be parted for ever. In heaven the saints are brought together, and no longer scattered; they are safe, and no longer exposed; separated from corrupt neighbours without, and corrupt affections within, and there is no chaff among them. Hell is the unquenchable fire, which will certainly be the portion and punishment of hypocrites and unbelievers. Here life and death, good and evil, are set before us: according as we now are in the field, we shall be then in the floor.</body></html>
