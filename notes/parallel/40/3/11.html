The result of John's baptism, even for those who received it faithfully, did not go beyond the change of character and life implied in "repentance." The higher powers of the unseen world were to be manifested afterwards.<p><span class= "bld">He that cometh after me.</span>--The words as spoken by the Baptist could only refer to the expected Christ, the <span class= "ital">Lord,</span> whose way he had been sent to prepare.<p><span class= "bld">Mightier.</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> as the words that follow show, stronger both to save and to punish; at once the Deliverer and the Judge.<p><span class= "bld">Whose shoes I am not worthy to bear.</span>--In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-16.htm" title="John answered, saying to them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I comes, the lace of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:">Luke 3:16</a> we have the yet stronger expression, "The latchet (or thong) of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose." Among Jews, Greeks, and Romans alike, this office, that of untying and carrying the shoes of the master of the house or of a guest, was the well-known function of the lowest slave of the household. When our Lord washed the disciples' feet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/13-4.htm" title="He rises from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.">John 13:4-5</a>), He was taking upon Himself a like menial task which, of course, actually involved the other. The remembrance of the Baptist's words may in part account for St. Peter's indignant refusal to accept such services.<p><span class= "bld">He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.</span>--As heard and understood at the time, the baptism with the Holy Ghost would imply that the souls thus baptised would be plunged, as it were, in that creative and informing Spirit which was the source of life and holiness and wisdom. The baptism "with fire" would convey, in its turn, the thought of a power at once destroying evil and purifying good; not, in any case, without the suffering that attends the contact of the sinner's soul with the "consuming fire" of the holiness of God, yet for those who had received the earlier baptism, and what it was meant to convey, consuming only what was evil, and leaving that which was precious brighter than before. The appearance of the "tongues <span class= "ital">like</span> as of fire" that accompanied the gift of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost was an outward visible sign, an extension of the symbolism, rather than the actual fulfilment of the promise.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - (Cf, especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-27.htm">John 1:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-25.htm">Acts 13:25</a>; also Acts 19:4.) After our ver. 10 St. Luke inserts details of the various kinds of fruit that repentance ought to produce, suggested by the questions of different portions of the Baptist's audience; and then, with an explanatory note that John's words were due to a misconception having arisen that he was himself the Messiah, he adds what we have in vers. 11, 12. But even if vers. 0-12 were, in fact, not said consecutively, yet their juxtaposition here may be defended by the real connexion between the statements. In ver. 10 John has spoken of the present danger of his audience; he therefore now urges repentance, and that in view of the coming of One who will sift them to the uttermost. <span class="cmt_word">With water</span>; <span class="accented">in</span>, Revised Version margin (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>), and so in the second part of the verse. The thought is not of the instrument by which the baptism is effected, but of the element in which it takes place. "In" suggests more complete submergence of the personality. <span class="cmt_word">But he that cometh after me</span>. The expression would recall the thought of" the Coming One" - a common designation of Messiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-3.htm">Matthew 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Is mightier than I</span>. Not in authority (the next clause), nor in honour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-30.htm">John 1:30</a>), but in inherent strength and power. <span class="cmt_word">Whose shoes</span>. Though shoes or boots were usual in the winter, at all events later, and probably also now (cf. Edersheim, 'Life,' 1:621), yet sandals are doubtless meant. "In the LXX. and Josephus <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-9.htm">Mark 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-8.htm">Acts 12:8</a>) and <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> [here] are used indiscriminately" (Thayer). <span class="cmt_word">Worthy</span>. In moral sufficiency (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) , and so in the parallels, but (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) in moral desert in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-27.htm">John 1:27</a>. <span class="cmt_word">To bear</span>; complementary to "loosen" in the parallel passages. The duty of slaves of the lowest rank. The distance of superiority here attributed by John to "him that cometh after me," must be reckoned even greater than it usually is; for most of the slaves then held by Jewish masters would not be Jews, but Gentiles. The thought is, "I am further removed from my successor than the meanest Gentile slave is from his Jewish master." Some have seen in this expression a reference to the practice of disciples carrying the shoes of their teachers (Edersheim, 'Life,' 1:272), but this can hardly have been general so early. <span class="cmt_word">He</span>. The emphasis is made the more evident by the absence of any connecting particle. <span class="cmt_word">Shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">baptize you</span>. "The transference of the image of baptism to the impartment of the Holy Spirit was prepared by such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a>)" (Bishop Westcott, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-33.htm">John 1:33</a>); comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25-27</a>, where the symbol of cleansing by water and the gift of the Holy Spirit are closely connected. <span class="cmt_word">With the Holy Ghost, and with fire</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f09;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>). To the visible John contrasts the invisible, to the symbol of water the reality of the Spirit; adding (here and in the parallel passage in Luke) to this, which forms the main point of the contrast (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-8.htm">Mark 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-33.htm">John 1:33</a>), the thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2</a>, purification as by fire; and, by not placing it under the government of another preposition (which would have necessitated the conception of it as a distinct element) implying that it is only another aspect of one and the same baptism. It has been questioned, indeed, whether "fire" here refers to the purification of the godly who truly accept the baptism of the Spirit, or to the destruction of the wicked, as in vers. 10, 12. But the thought is one. The Divine presence will in fact, as is recognized by Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-14.htm">Isaiah 33:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-9.htm">Isaiah 31:9</a>), be twofold in its working, according as it is yielded to or the reverse. It burns away sin out of the godly, and it consumes the ungodly if they cleave to their sin. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:7-12 To make application to the souls of the hearers, is the life of preaching; so it was of John's preaching. The Pharisees laid their chief stress on outward observances, neglecting the weightier matters of the moral law, and the spiritual meaning of their legal ceremonies. Others of them were detestable hypocrites, making their pretences to holiness a cloak for iniquity. The Sadducees ran into the opposite extreme, denying the existence of spirits, and a future state. They were the scornful infidels of that time and country. There is a wrath to come. It is the great concern of every one to flee from that wrath. God, who delights not in our ruin, has warned us; he warns by the written word, by ministers, by conscience. And those are not worthy of the name of penitents, or their privileges, who say they are sorry for their sins, yet persist in them. It becomes penitents to be humble and low in their own eyes, to be thankful for the least mercy, patient under the greatest affliction, to be watchful against all appearances of sin, to abound in every duty, and to be charitable in judging others. Here is a word of caution, not to trust in outward privileges. There is a great deal which carnal hearts are apt to say within themselves, to put aside the convincing, commanding power of the word of God. Multitudes, by resting in the honours and mere advantages of their being members of an outward church, come short of heaven. Here is a word of terror to the careless and secure. Our corrupt hearts cannot be made to produce good fruit, unless the regenerating Spirit of Christ graft the good word of God upon them. And every tree, however high in gifts and honours, however green in outward professions and performances, if it bring not forth good fruit, the fruits meet for repentance, is hewn down and cast into the fire of God's wrath, the fittest place for barren trees: what else are they good for? If not fit for fruit, they are fit for fuel. John shows the design and intention of Christ's appearing, which they were now speedily to expect. No outward forms can make us clean. No ordinances, by whomsoever administered, or after whatever mode, can supply the want of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and of fire. The purifying and cleansing power of the Holy Spirit alone can produce that purity of heart, and those holy affections, which accompany salvation. It is Christ who baptizes with the Holy Ghost. This he did in the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit sent upon the apostles, Ac 2:4. This he does in the graces and comforts of the Spirit, given to those that ask him, Lu 11:13; Joh 7:38,39; see Ac 11:16. Observe here, the outward church is Christ's floor, Isa 21:10. True believers are as wheat, substantial, useful, and valuable; hypocrites are as chaff, light and empty, useless and worthless, carried about with every wind; these are mixed, good and bad, in the same outward communion. There is a day coming when the wheat and chaff shall be separated. The last judgment will be the distinguishing day, when saints and sinners shall be parted for ever. In heaven the saints are brought together, and no longer scattered; they are safe, and no longer exposed; separated from corrupt neighbours without, and corrupt affections within, and there is no chaff among them. Hell is the unquenchable fire, which will certainly be the portion and punishment of hypocrites and unbelievers. Here life and death, good and evil, are set before us: according as we now are in the field, we shall be then in the floor.</body></html>
