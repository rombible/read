"The heavens were opened to <span class= "ital">him"</span> as they were to Stephen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-56.htm" title="And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.">Acts 7:56</a>). The Baptist bears record that he too beheld the Spirit descending (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-33.htm" title="And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.">John 1:33-34</a>), but there is not the slightest ground for supposing that there was any manifestation to others. So in the vision near Damascus, St. Paul only heard the words and saw the form of Him who spake them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-7.htm" title="And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.">Acts 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-9.htm" title="And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spoke to me.">Acts 22:9</a>). That which they did see served, as did the tongues of fire on the day of Pentecost, as an attestation to the consciousness of each, of the reality of the gift imparted, and of its essential character. That descent of the Spirit, "as it were a dove," as St. Luke adds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-22.htm" title="And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove on him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, You are my beloved Son; in you I am well pleased.">Luke 3:22</a>), "in bodily form," taught the Baptist, as it teaches us, that the gift of supernatural power and wisdom brought with it also the perfection of the tenderness, the purity, the gentleness of which the dove was the acknowledged symbol. To be "harmless as doves" was the command the Lord gave to His disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-16.htm" title="Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the middle of wolves: be you therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.">Matthew 10:16</a>), and when they read this record, they were taught as we are, "of what manner of spirit" they were meant to be.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus, when he was baptized</span>. Combining the statements of the synoptists, we may conclude that Jesus went up from the water at once, praying as he went, and that, while he was going up and praying, the heavens opened. <span class="cmt_word">Out of</span>; <span class="accented">from</span> '(Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span>; for, as it seems, he had not gone fully out of the water. <span class="cmt_word">The heavens were opened unto him</span>. So also the Revised Version, but the Revised Version margin, with Westcott and Herr, rightly omits "unto him." The words were inserted because it was thought that Jesus alone saw the manifestation, as indeed we should have supposed if we had had only the account of St. Mark, who reads, "he saw" before "the heavens being rent asunder" (but cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32-34</a>). To our Lord and to the Baptist the appearance was as though the sky really opened (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit of God</span>; recalling <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>. "Messiah now enters on his public office, and for that receives, as true Man, the appropriate gifts. The Spirit by whom men are sub jectively united to God descends upon the Word made Flesh, by whom objectively God is revealed to men" (Bishop Westcott, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Like</span>; <span class="accented">as</span> (Revised Version). The comparison is hardly to the gentleness of the descent of a dove, but to a visible appearance in bodily form, as a dove (see parallel passage in Luke). Not, of course, that the Holy Spirit was thus at all incarnate, but that either the appearance of a dove was seen by John's eyes only (cf. especially Theodore of Mopsuestia, in Meyer), or, as is not unlikely (even though the suggestion belongs ultimately to Paulus), a dove really flew down and lighted on the Lord (Luke), and that this, to outsiders merely a curious incident (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-29.htm">John 12:29</a>), was to our Lord and the Baptist a sign of spiritual blessing. <span class="cmt_word">A dove</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>); any member of the pigeon tribe; chosen because a symbol of deliverance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-8.htm">Genesis 8:8</a>), of purity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-7.htm">Leviticus 5:7</a>), of harmlessness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>), and of endearment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/6-9.htm">Song of Solomon 6:9</a>). There is no evidence (cf. Edersheim, 'Life,' 1:287) that the dove was <span class="accented">at this period</span> interpreted by Jews as a symbol of the Holy Spirit. The Targum on <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-12.htm">Song of Solomon 2:12</a> paraphrasing "the voice of the turtle-dove ' by "the voice of the Holy Spirit," dates in its present form from the eighth to the tenth century. The dove mentioned (though probably by interpolation) in the account of Polycarp's death, appears to be a symbol of the soul (cf. Bishop Lightfoot). Wichelhaus (as quoted by Kubel) says suggestively, "lamb and dove - no kingdom in the world has these emblems on its escutcheon." <span class="cmt_word">And</span>; omit, with manuscripts. <span class="cmt_word">Lighting</span>; <span class="accented">coming</span> (Revised Version), because it is needless to translate a common Greek (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) by a rare English word. Observe that it refers to the Holy Spirit, not to the dove as such. <span class="cmt_word">Upon him</span> (so Luke and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32, 33</a>; Mark more vaguely, "unto him"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:13-17 Christ's gracious condescensions are so surprising, that even the strongest believers at first can hardly believe them; so deep and mysterious, that even those who know his mind well, are apt to start objections against the will of Christ. And those who have much of the Spirit of God while here, see that they need to apply to Christ for more. Christ does not deny that John had need to be baptized of him, yet declares he will now be baptized of John. Christ is now in a state of humiliation. Our Lord Jesus looked upon it as well becoming him to fulfil all righteousness, to own every Divine institution, and to show his readiness to comply with all God's righteous precepts. In and through Christ, the heavens are opened to the children of men. This descent of the Spirit upon Christ, showed that he was endued with his sacred influences without measure. The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance. At Christ's baptism there was a manifestation of the three Persons in the sacred Trinity. The Father confirming the Son to be Mediator; the Son solemnly entering upon the work; the Holy Spirit descending on him, to be through his mediation communicated to his people. In Him our spiritual sacrifices are acceptable, for He is the altar that sanctifies every gift, 1Pe 2:5. Out of Christ, God is a consuming fire, but in Christ, a reconciled Father. This is the sum of the gospel, which we must by faith cheerfully embrace.</body></html>
