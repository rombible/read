In each case the reference shows how strongly the great second part of Isaiah had impressed itself on the minds of men. To the Baptist, brooding over the sins of his people, and the long-expected consolation of Israel, there had come "the word of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-2.htm" title="Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.">Luke 3:2</a>), bidding him identify himself with that "voice of one crying in the wilderness."<p>Historically, the connection of the opening chapters of this part of Isaiah with the protests against idolatry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/40-18.htm" title="To whom then will you liken God? or what likeness will you compare to him?">Isaiah 40:18-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-7.htm" title="So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smoothes with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for the soldering: and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.">Isaiah 41:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/44-9.htm" title="They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>), and with the name of Cyrus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm" title="That said of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, You shall be built; and to the temple, Your foundation shall be laid.">Isaiah 44:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have held, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut;">Isaiah 45:1</a>), shows that the prophet blended his glorious visions of the ideal polity of the future with the return of the exiles from Babylon. The return came, and the ideal was not realised. The kingdom of heaven seemed still far off. Now, the Baptist came to proclaim its nearness.<p><span class= "bld">Prepare ye the way of the Lord.</span>--The imagery is drawn from the great strategical works of the conquerors of the East. They sent a herald before them to call the people of the countries through which they marched to prepare for their approach. A "king's highway" had to be carried through the open land of the wilderness, valleys filled up, and hills levelled (the words used are, of course, poetical in their greatness), winding bye-paths straightened, for the march of the great army. Interpreted in its spiritual application, the wilderness was the world lying in evil, and the making low the mountains and hills was the bringing down of spiritual pride. When the poor in spirit were received into the kingdom of heaven, the valleys were exalted; when soldier and publican renounced their special sins, the rough places were made plain and the crooked straight.<p>It is probable that the stress thus laid upon "the way of the Lord," in the first stage of the Gospel, led to the peculiar use of the term "the way" by St. Luke, to denote what we should call the "religion" of the Apostolic Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-2.htm" title="And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.">Acts 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/18-25.htm" title="This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.">Acts 18:25-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-9.htm" title="But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.">Acts 19:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-23.htm" title="And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.">Acts 19:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-4.htm" title="And I persecuted this way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.">Acts 22:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-14.htm" title="But this I confess to you, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:">Acts 24:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-22.htm" title="And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.">Acts 24:22</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-23.htm">John 1:23</a> the following quotation is uttered by the Baptist himself, and some commentators have supposed this to be the case also here. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> this is against the parallel passages in Mark and Luke. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The form of the expression in John arises directly from the context. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> In the Baptist's mouth the neuter (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>) rather than the masculine would have been more natural. The expression is doubtless that of the evangelist, suggested to him by John's own utterance, the "is" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) expressing John's permanent character. Contrast <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>, (ver. 4) of his clothing and food. [<span class="accented">He that was</span>] <span class="accented">spoken of.</span> The expression means, not a mere reference found in Isaiah, but the absolute content of the prophet's words. The utterance of God by means of the prophet is - John the:Baptist. <span class="cmt_word">The Prophet Esaias</span>; <span class="accented">Isaiah the prophet</span> (Revised Version); the commoner Greek order (but cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-17.htm">Luke 4:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The voice</span>, etc. (except "his" for "our God," from the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>). The Hebrew probably joins "in the wilderness" with "prepare ye," but St. Matthew with "crying" (cf ver. 1, "preaching in the wilderness," as probably the LXX.) In Isaiah the original meaning of the passage was probably, "prepare for the return to Jerusalem." The figure is that of the common and necessary process in semi-civilized countries of repairing roads before a great personage comes along them. Zechariah had; years before, applied the similar expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a> to his son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-76.htm">Luke 1:76</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-2.htm">Mark 1:2</a>). (For a metaphor like in kind, but with contrasted meaning, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, breaking up a road to render it impassable.) <span class="cmt_word">Paths</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>). According to Philo, the word is equivalent to "a carriage-road" (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">vide</span> in Wetstein). It is thus equivalent to the Hebrew (<span class="accented">m</span> <span class="accented">sillah</span>, "a highway," "a made road"). Possibly the plural was employed by the LXX. rather than the singular of the original, from their interpreting the passage, not of the return of the Lord to Palestine, but his coming into many hearts. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 After Malachi there was no prophet until John the Baptist came. He appeared first in the wilderness of Judea. This was not an uninhabited desert, but a part of the country not thickly peopled, nor much enclosed. No place is so remote as to shut us out from the visits of Divine grace. The doctrine he preached was repentance; Repent ye. The word here used, implies a total alteration in the mind, a change in the judgment, disposition, and affections, another and a better bias of the soul. Consider your ways, change your minds: you have thought amiss; think again, and think aright. True penitents have other thoughts of God and Christ, sin and holiness, of this world and the other, than they had. The change of the mind produces a change of the way. That is gospel repentance, which flows from a sight of Christ, from a sense of his love, and from hopes of pardon and forgiveness through him. It is a great encouragement to us to repent; repent, for your sins shall be pardoned upon your repentance. Return to God in a way of duty, and he will, through Christ, return unto you in the way of mercy. It is still as necessary to repent and humble ourselves, to prepare the way of the Lord, as it then was. There is a great deal to be done, to make way for Christ into a soul, and nothing is more needful than the discovery of sin, and a conviction that we cannot be saved by our own righteousness. The way of sin and Satan is a crooked way; but to prepare a way for Christ, the paths must be made straight, Heb 12:13. Those whose business it is to call others to mourn for sin, and to mortify it, ought themselves to live a serious life, a life of self-denial, and contempt of the world. By giving others this example, John made way for Christ. Many came to John's baptism, but few kept to the profession they made. There may be many forward hearers, where there are few true believers. Curiosity, and love for novelty and variety, may bring many to attend on good preaching, and to be affected for a while, who never are subject to the power of it. Those who received John's doctrine, testified their repentance by confessing their sins. Those only are ready to receive Jesus Christ as their righteousness, who are brought with sorrow and shame to own their guilt. The benefits of the kingdom of heaven, now at hand, were thereupon sealed to them by baptism. John washed them with water, in token that God would cleanse them from all their iniquities, thereby intimating, that by nature and practice all were polluted, and could not be admitted among the people of God, unless washed from their sins in the fountain Christ was to open, Zec 13:1.</body></html>
