The "bosom" of Abraham was wide enough to receive all his children. "We have Abraham as our father" was to the Jew all and more than all that "civis Romanus sum" was to the Romans.<p><span class= "bld">Of these stones.</span>--The words were obviously dramatised by gesture, pointing to the pebbles on the banks of the Jordan. In their spiritual application, they are remarkable as containing the germs of all the teaching of our Lord, and of St. Paul, and of St. John, as to the calling of the Gentiles, and the universality of God's kingdom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span>. An additional warning against any false feeling of security based on natural privileges. As this feeling was common to all Jews, the reference to the larger audience (ver. 7, note) was probably begun here. <span class="cmt_word">Think not to say</span>. <span class="accented">Not</span> do not think, consider, with a view to saying; <span class="accented">but</span> do not think it right to say, do not be of opinion you may say (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-8.htm">Luke 3:8</a>, "Begin not to say ). St. Luke deprecates the commencement of such an utterance in their heart; S t. Matthew denies its justice. <span class="cmt_word">Within yourselves</span>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-13.htm">Esther 4:13</a> (Hebrew). <span class="cmt_word">We have Abraham to our father</span>. As it was recognized on all hands that the promise of blessing was made to Abraham and his seed, it is no wonder that many Jews presumed upon their descent from him, "sup, posing,", as Justin Martyr says ('Trypho,' &sect; 140.), that the everlasting kingdom will assuredly be given to those who are of the seed of Abraham according to the flesh, although they be sinners and unbelieving and disobedient towards God." In later times, when the doctrine of merit was more fully established, God could be represented as saying to Abraham, "If thy children were like dead bodies without sinews or bones, thy merit would avail for them" ('Ber. Rabb.,' on Genesis 10:5:11. &sect; 44, middle). In John's words, on the contrary, we have the germ of the doctrine afterwards Brought out by St. Paul (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-9.htm">Galatians 3:9, 29</a>), that not natural descent, but spiritual relationship by faith, leads to inheriting the promises. The argument in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>, etc., is closely akin to that presented here. In both passages the Jews lay stress on their origin from Abraham; in both the answer is that morally they are sprung from a very different source (supra, ver. 7, note). But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8.htm">John 8</a>. the Jews are thinking chiefly of their present state, of not being as sinful as Jesus makes them out to be, while here they are thinking more of the future, that they have no need to take trouble, because promises for the future belong to them. Hence, perhaps, the exact expression (contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-33.htm">John 8:33</a>), "We have Abraham as father," which brings out the protecting influence of Abraham as still available. <span class="cmt_word">For I say unto you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>). The solemnity of the phrase (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25, 29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-11.htm">Matthew 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-9.htm">Matthew 11:9</a>) lies in the self-consciousness which it implies. The absence of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;</span> shows that the speaker has no desire to bring out his own personality (contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>, etc.), but the message only. That God. Not "the LORD," because <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the thought is of power rather than of covenant relationship; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> he is about to speak of others than members of the covenant nation. <span class="cmt_word">Is able of</span> <span class="cmt_word">these stones</span>. <span class="accented">These</span>; apodeictic (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-3.htm">Matthew 4:3</a>). Some have thought that by <span class="accented">these stones</span> John directly means certain Gentiles who were standing near; but it is much mere likely that he points to the literal stones at his feet, and with strong hyperbole says that he who once raised up offspring as the stars for multitude from persons as good as dead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-19.htm">Romans 4:19</a>), and who had originally made man of the dust of the earth, can (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), with both physical power and moral right, raise out of the very rawest material a new Israel (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-17.htm">Romans 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-28.htm">1 Corinthians 1:28</a>, "the things that are not"). <span class="cmt_word">Raise up</span>. The verb employed (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span>) is, as it seems, not used in the LXX. with reference to natural generation, but <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-8.htm">Genesis 38:8</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-25.htm">Genesis 4:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-32.htm">Genesis 19:32</a>; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-24.htm">Matthew 22:24</a>). It is, however, very suitable here, for while <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span> regards future worth, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span> specially contrasts a later with an earlier state (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> sleep) - in this case the nature of children with the insensibility of stones. <span class="cmt_word">Children</span>. The new Israel would possess, not merely Abraham's privileges, but his nature and character (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>), in which you to whom I now speak are so deficient. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:7-12 To make application to the souls of the hearers, is the life of preaching; so it was of John's preaching. The Pharisees laid their chief stress on outward observances, neglecting the weightier matters of the moral law, and the spiritual meaning of their legal ceremonies. Others of them were detestable hypocrites, making their pretences to holiness a cloak for iniquity. The Sadducees ran into the opposite extreme, denying the existence of spirits, and a future state. They were the scornful infidels of that time and country. There is a wrath to come. It is the great concern of every one to flee from that wrath. God, who delights not in our ruin, has warned us; he warns by the written word, by ministers, by conscience. And those are not worthy of the name of penitents, or their privileges, who say they are sorry for their sins, yet persist in them. It becomes penitents to be humble and low in their own eyes, to be thankful for the least mercy, patient under the greatest affliction, to be watchful against all appearances of sin, to abound in every duty, and to be charitable in judging others. Here is a word of caution, not to trust in outward privileges. There is a great deal which carnal hearts are apt to say within themselves, to put aside the convincing, commanding power of the word of God. Multitudes, by resting in the honours and mere advantages of their being members of an outward church, come short of heaven. Here is a word of terror to the careless and secure. Our corrupt hearts cannot be made to produce good fruit, unless the regenerating Spirit of Christ graft the good word of God upon them. And every tree, however high in gifts and honours, however green in outward professions and performances, if it bring not forth good fruit, the fruits meet for repentance, is hewn down and cast into the fire of God's wrath, the fittest place for barren trees: what else are they good for? If not fit for fruit, they are fit for fuel. John shows the design and intention of Christ's appearing, which they were now speedily to expect. No outward forms can make us clean. No ordinances, by whomsoever administered, or after whatever mode, can supply the want of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and of fire. The purifying and cleansing power of the Holy Spirit alone can produce that purity of heart, and those holy affections, which accompany salvation. It is Christ who baptizes with the Holy Ghost. This he did in the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit sent upon the apostles, Ac 2:4. This he does in the graces and comforts of the Spirit, given to those that ask him, Lu 11:13; Joh 7:38,39; see Ac 11:16. Observe here, the outward church is Christ's floor, Isa 21:10. True believers are as wheat, substantial, useful, and valuable; hypocrites are as chaff, light and empty, useless and worthless, carried about with every wind; these are mixed, good and bad, in the same outward communion. There is a day coming when the wheat and chaff shall be separated. The last judgment will be the distinguishing day, when saints and sinners shall be parted for ever. In heaven the saints are brought together, and no longer scattered; they are safe, and no longer exposed; separated from corrupt neighbours without, and corrupt affections within, and there is no chaff among them. Hell is the unquenchable fire, which will certainly be the portion and punishment of hypocrites and unbelievers. Here life and death, good and evil, are set before us: according as we now are in the field, we shall be then in the floor.</body></html>
