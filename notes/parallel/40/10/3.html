Nathanael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-45.htm">John 1:45</a>, equivalent to <span class="accented">Theodore</span>) was so common a name (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-8.htm">Numbers 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-14.htm">1 Chronicles 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-24.htm">1 Chronicles 15:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-4.htm">1 Chronicles 26:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-7.htm">2 Chronicles 17:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-9.htm">2 Chronicles 35:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-22.htm">Ezra 10:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-21.htm">Nehemiah 12:21, 36</a>), that for further identification a patronymic ("son of Tolmai," Ptolemy) was used, which in this case (as in the case of a Bartholomew mentioned in 'Pesikta Rabbathi,' &sect; 22, p. 113, edit. Friedmann; cf. also Levy, <span class="accented">s.v.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5dc;&#x5de;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>), superseded the proper name. <span class="cmt_word">Thomas</span>. "As Thomas (<span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), ' the Twin,' is properly a surname, and this apostle must have had some other name, there seems no reason for doubting this very early tradition [Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' 1:13, and probably the Old Syriac of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-22.htm">John 14:22</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>] that he also was a Jude" (Bishop Lightfoot, 'Galatians,' p. 257, edit. 1869). The ' Clem. Hem.,' 2:1, give Eliezer as the name of the other brother. <span class="cmt_word">Matthew the publican</span> (Introduction, p. 20.), <span class="cmt_word">James the son of Alphseus.</span> (On the possibility of the name and the person being identical with the Clopas of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-25.htm">John 19:25</a>, cf.

If the word "Thaddaeus" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span>) was as seems likely (for Edersheim's connexion of it with <span class="accented">todah</span>, "praise," is based on what is apparently a mere play of words in Talm. Bob., 'Sanh.,' 43a), originally a pet-name (<span class="accented">Sehosskind</span>, "Bosom-child," Weiss, Nosgen) from <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, "the female breasts," it is intelligible that he or others would prefer the somewhat synonymous "Lebbseus" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>, "heart"), which might mean "child of one's heart," but more probably "courageous," found in the "Western" text. The similarity of sound would help towards this, even if another derivation that seems possible, "the Fiery" (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "kindle"), be the true one. In the latter case the appellation, "Jude the Zealot" (Old Latin), may rest on something more than a mistaken interpretation of the parallel passage in Luke. In Westcott and Herr, 'App.,' it is said that "this name [Lebbaeus] is apparently due to an early attempt to bring Levi (<span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>) the publican (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-27.htm">Luke 5:27</a>) within the Twelve, it being assumed that his call was to apostleship just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-14.htm">Mark 2:14</a> <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> is changed in Western texts to <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, because <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f09;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> follows, and it was assumed that the son of Halphseus elsewhere named as one of the Twelve must be meant. The difference between the two forms of the name would be inconsiderable in Aramaic, <span class="accented">Lewi</span> and <span class="accented">Levi</span> or <span class="accented">Lebi</span> or <span class="accented">Lebbi</span>; and <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> might as easily represent <span class="accented">Lebbi as</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a4;&#x3b7;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x2e;</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-4 The word apostle signifies messenger; they were Christ's messengers, sent forth to proclaim his kingdom. Christ gave them power to heal all manner of sickness. In the grace of the gospel there is a slave for every sore, a remedy for every malady. There is no spiritual disease, but there is power in Christ for the cure of it. There names are recorded, and it is their honour; yet they had more reason to rejoice that their names were written in heaven, while the high and mighty names of the great ones of the earth are buried in the dust.</body></html>
