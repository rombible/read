St. Matthew's report includes all the three forms of the money then in circulation. The tense of the word rendered "provide" requires notice. It implies that if they had money, they might take it, but they were not to "get" or "provide" it as a condition of their journey, still less to delay till they had got it.<p><span class= "bld">In your purses.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">in your girdles</span>--the twisted folds of which were, and are, habitually used in the East instead of the "purse" of the West.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10a.</span> - Parallel passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-8.htm">Mark 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-3.htm">Luke 9:3</a> (the twelve); 10:4 (the seventy); cf. also our Lord's reference in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-35.htm">Luke 22:35</a> to the mission of the twelve. <span class="cmt_word">Provide</span>; <span class="accented">get you</span> (Revised Version, Authorized Version margin). There is no connotation of foresight in the word itself, but only of acquisition. Observe that the apostles are not forbidden to take what they already have. Lightfoot, 'Hor. Hebr.,' shows that travellers ordinarily took with them a staff, a purse, shoes, a wallet, and sometimes a book of the Law. <span class="cmt_word">Neither gold, nor silver, nor brass</span>. The <span class="accented">brass</span> would be the copper coinage of the Herods (examples are figured in Smith's 'Dict. of Bible,' 2. p. 413), which alone might be struck by them; or some of the Greek imperial coins, especially those struck at Antioch. The <span class="accented">silver</span>, either Greek imperial tetradrachms or Roman denarii of a quarter their weight, didrachms having fallen into disuse; only certain free cities were allowed to coin silver. The <span class="accented">gold</span>, as Palestine was a subject province, must have been coined at Rome, for she retained the coining of gold entirely in her own hands (cf. Madden's 'Coins of the Jews,' pp. 107, 290, ft., edit. 1881; and It. S. Peele, in Smith's 'Dict. of Bible,' <span class="accented">s.vv.</span> "Money," "Stater;" further, see ver. 29). <span class="cmt_word">In your purses</span>; literally, <span class="accented">girdles</span>, which in the East often serve as purses. This prohibition may have been suggested by the last words of ver. 8, but can hardly refer to them. It seems to regard the journey only (cf. parallel passages). <span class="cmt_word">Nor scrip</span>; no <span class="accented">wallet</span> (Revised Version). At the present time, "all shepherds have them, and they are the farmer's universal <span class="accented">vade-mecum.</span> They are merely the skins of kids stripped off whole, and tanned by a very simple process" (Thomson's 'Land and the Book,' p. 345, edit. 1887, where a picture of one is given). But they might be made even of fish-skin (Mishna, 'Kelim,' 24:11). Because of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-40.htm">1 Samuel 17:40</a>, an haggada says that David's money was stamped with a staff and wallet on one side, and a tower on the other ('B'resh..R.,' &sect; 39, in Levy, <span class="accented">s.v.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e8;&#x5de;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">For your journey</span>. The clause is to be joined with "scrip" only. <span class="cmt_word">Neither two coats</span>. A second for sabbaths and festivals. For the rabbinic rule insisted upon a different coat for these days from that ordinarily worn. To the objection of poor disciples, that they had but one garment for sabbath and week-day alike, R. Samlai said that they must at least change the way in which they wore it (Talm. Jeremiah. 'Pea.,' 8:7 [S], in Hamburger, 'Realencycl.,' 2. p. 642. <span class="cmt_word">Neither shoes</span>. The parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-9.htm">Mark 6:9</a>, has. "but <span class="accented">to go</span> shod with sandals" (Revised Version). This is, perhaps, a case of verbal inaccuracy, but as it is impossible to suppose that our Lord can have wished his disciples to go without the ordinary protection to the feet, or that the author of this Gospel, accustomed, on any theory, to Eastern modes of life, can have intended to credit him with such a wish, some other explanation of the verbal discrepancy must be looked for. The true explanation is probably this - The rabbis insisted so strongly on a man never appearing barefooted: "Let a man sell the beams of his house and buy shoes for his feet" (Talm. Bab., 'Sabb.,' 129<span class="accented">a</span>), that it is very possible that a second pair was often carried in ease of need. it is this that our Lord forbids. On the other hand, Jews did not carry one pair for sabbath and another for week-days (Talm. Jeremiah, 'Sabb.,' 6:2). Some commentators escape the difficulty by distinguishing between "shoes" and "sandals;" but it is very doubtful if the usage of the words is always so exact that one term excludes the other. <span class="cmt_word">Nor yet staves</span>; <span class="accented">nor staff</span> (Revised Version). The plural, both here (Stephen) and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-3.htm">Luke 9:3</a> (Received Text), is a clumsy attempt to harmonize with <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6.htm">Mark 6</a>.8, where our Lord bids the twelve take nothing "save a staff only." The difference between the two reports of our Lord's words has been magnified by many commentators into a contradiction. But this is not the true state of the case. For it would be so extraordinary and apparently so useless an order to forbid their having a staff, that it is hard to suppose this to have been the meaning of his words as <span class="accented">reported</span> here. His thought in vers. 9, 10 is rather that they were to make no preparation, for their wants should be supplied, and that even if they had not a staff they were not to take the trouble to procure one. St. Mark's account only so far differs that he assumes that they will st least have a staff already. Observe, however, that no stress can be placed on the difference of the verbs here and in Mark, for in this respect Mark and Luke agree. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10b.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the workman</span>; <span class="accented">labourer</span> (Revised Version); thus connecting the utterance closely with <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-37.htm">Matthew 9:37, 38</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Is worthy of his meat</span>. The disciples may therefore expect that it will be provided for them by those to whom they minister (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>, of the seventy), and indirectly by the Master whom they serve (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-38.htm">Matthew 9:38</a>). <span class="accented">Meat</span>; <span class="accented">food</span> (Revised Version). In all but most highly organized systems of society, this is an important (frequently the most important) part of the day labourer's wages. Hence not unnaturally "<span class="accented">wages"</span> is found in the form of the sayings given by St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>) and St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-18.htm">1 Timothy 5:18</a>). Probably our Lord's words became a current proverb in Christian circles, the original word "<span class="accented">food"</span> being modified to suit the more general circumstances of life. Clem. Romans, &sect; 31, recalls the Matthaean form, "The good workman receiveth the bread of his work with boldness." Epiphanius gives a kind of confla-tion, containing the further thought that if the workman receives his food he must be content: "The workman is worthy of his hire, and sufficient to him that works is his food." Resch ('Agrapha,' pp. 97, 140) connects this form of the saying with the practice of giving only food to the travelling "apostles" and prophets of the sub-apostolic age ('Did.,' &sect; 11.). Professor Marshall (<span class="accented">Expositor</span>, IV. 2:76) suggests that if our Lord's original word was <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, it would explain the origin of both Matthew and Luke; but it seems very doubtful it' it really ever means "<span class="accented">wages."</span> Two patristic remarks are worth quoting: the first from Origen ('Cram. Cat.'), "In saying <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, ('food') he forbade <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> ('luxury');" the second from St. Gregory the Great (in Ford), "Priests ought to consider how criminal and punishable a thing it is to receive the fruit of labour, without labour." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:5-15 The Gentiles must not have the gospel brought them, till the Jews have refused it. This restraint on the apostles was only in their first mission. Wherever they went they must proclaim, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. They preached, to establish the faith; the kingdom, to animate the hope; of heaven, to inspire the love of heavenly things, and the contempt of earthly; which is at hand, that men may prepare for it without delay. Christ gave power to work miracles for the confirming of their doctrine. This is not necessary now that the kingdom of God is come. It showed that the intent of the doctrine they preached, was to heal sick souls, and to raise those that were dead in sin. In proclaiming the gospel of free grace for the healing and saving of men's souls, we must above all avoid the appearance of the spirit of an hireling. They are directed what to do in strange towns and cities. The servant of Christ is the ambassador of peace to whatever place he is sent. His message is even to the vilest sinners, yet it behoves him to find out the best persons in every place. It becomes us to pray heartily for all, and to conduct ourselves courteously to all. They are directed how to act as to those that refused them. The whole counsel of God must be declared, and those who will not attend to the gracious message, must be shown that their state is dangerous. This should be seriously laid to heart by all that hear the gospel, lest their privileges only serve to increase their condemnation.</body></html>
