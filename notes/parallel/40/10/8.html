That was reserved for His own immediate act. The insertion of the words was probably due to a wish to make the command cover such instances of power as that shown in the instances of Dorcas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-40.htm" title="But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.">Acts 9:40</a>) and Eutychus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/20-9.htm" title="And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.">Acts 20:9-12</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Freely ye have received.</span>--The English hardly suggests more than giving liberally. The Greek is much stronger, "Give as a free gift--give <span class= "ital">gratis"</span> They had paid Him nothing. They were not in this their first mission to require payment from others. When the kingdom had been established, the necessities of the case might require the application of the principle that "the labourer is worthy of his hire" in an organised system of stipend and the like (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-18.htm" title="For the scripture said, You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the corn. And, The laborer is worthy of his reward.">1Timothy 5:18</a>); but the principle of "giving freely" in this sense is always applicable in proportion as the work of the ministers of Christ has the character of a mission. They must proclaim the kingdom till the sense of the blessing it has brought shows itself in the thank-offerings of gratitude. The like principle of gratuitous teaching had been asserted before by some of the nobler of the Jewish Rabbis.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - We have here the details of the orders summarized in ver. 1.

On the good that might be expected from their performing these miracles, cf. Thomas Scott (in Ford), "Men will never believe that we really intend the good of their souls, if they do not find that we endeavour to do them good, disinterestedly, in temporal things (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-15.htm">John 4:15</a>)." <span class="cmt_word">Freely</span> (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>ye have</span> (omit "have," with Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">received</span>.

All that is needed to carry that authority into effect - whatever toil and energy in soul and body the occasion may demand. The clause comes in Matthew only, but comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>. Observe, Christ's recognition of the tendency of human nature to traffic in the holiest things. Did Judas take the warning at all to heart? (For the thought, cf.

This restraint on the apostles was only in their first mission. Wherever they went they must proclaim, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. They preached, to establish the faith; the kingdom, to animate the hope; of heaven, to inspire the love of heavenly things, and the contempt of earthly; which is at hand, that men may prepare for it without delay. Christ gave power to work miracles for the confirming of their doctrine. This is not necessary now that the kingdom of God is come. It showed that the intent of the doctrine they preached, was to heal sick souls, and to raise those that were dead in sin. In proclaiming the gospel of free grace for the healing and saving of men's souls, we must above all avoid the appearance of the spirit of an hireling. They are directed what to do in strange towns and cities. The servant of Christ is the ambassador of peace to whatever place he is sent. His message is even to the vilest sinners, yet it behoves him to find out the best persons in every place. It becomes us to pray heartily for all, and to conduct ourselves courteously to all. They are directed how to act as to those that refused them. The whole counsel of God must be declared, and those who will not attend to the gracious message, must be shown that their state is dangerous. This should be seriously laid to heart by all that hear the gospel, lest their privileges only serve to increase their condemnation.</body></html>
