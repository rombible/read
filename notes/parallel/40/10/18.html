This marks both the extreme importance that their enemies will attach to them, and the lengths to which these will go. <span class="cmt_word">Before governors</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, probably, representatives of others in supreme power. Such were Felix and Festus, the praetors at Philippi (hardly the politarchs at Thessalonica, for this was a free city), and Gallio at Corinth. But perhaps <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> is here used in the narrower sense of procurator, in which case of the above names only the first two ought to be mentioned, for Gallio was a proconsul (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">And kings</span>. The supreme authorities themselves. So especially Nero (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-16.htm">2 Timothy 4:16</a>), and even Herod Agrippa II.

St. Peter ("for the Lord's sake... king... governors," <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13, 14</a>) possibly refers to this utterance, but by using the singular, "king," recalls more definitely the one political organization with which his readers would be brought into contact in Asia Minor, the Roman emperor and his representatives. <span class="cmt_word">For a testimony against</span> (<span class="accented">to</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">them and</span> (<span class="accented">to</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">the Gentiles</span>. <span class="accented">Them.</span> Not the Jews (Bengel, Meyer, and perhaps also the Revised Version), but the governors and kings. For (<span class="accented">a</span>) the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-9.htm">Mark 13:9</a>, omits "the Gentiles;" (<span class="accented">b</span>) the parallel passage, ch. 24:14 (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>), runs, "This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world [possibly, too, the word employed, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, has special reference to the Roman empire] for a testimony unto all the Gentiles." Both passages show that the Lord is not here thinking of the Jews, but only of the Gentiles and rulers from among them. <span class="accented">Against</span>; <span class="accented">to.</span> A witness to these Gentile rulers of what the gospel really does for men, and of their consequent responsibility; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-4.htm">Matthew 8:4</a>, note; also the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-13.htm">Luke 21:13</a>. Eusebius, referring to out' Lord's words, gives a striking illustration in his 'Mart. Pal.,' 6. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:16-42 Our Lord warned his disciples to prepare for persecution. They were to avoid all things which gave advantage to their enemies, all meddling with worldly or political concerns, all appearance of evil or selfishness, and all underhand measures. Christ foretold troubles, not only that the troubles might not be a surprise, but that they might confirm their faith. He tells them what they should suffer, and from whom. Thus Christ has dealt fairly and faithfully with us, in telling us the worst we can meet with in his service; and he would have us deal so with ourselves, in sitting down and counting the cost. Persecutors are worse than beasts, in that they prey upon those of their own kind. The strongest bonds of love and duty, have often been broken through from enmity against Christ. Sufferings from friends and relations are very grievous; nothing cuts more. It appears plainly, that all who will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution; and we must expect to enter into the kingdom of God through many tribulations. With these predictions of trouble, are counsels and comforts for a time of trial. The disciples of Christ are hated and persecuted as serpents, and their ruin is sought, and they need the serpent's wisdom. Be ye harmless as doves. Not only, do nobody any hurt, but bear nobody any ill-will. Prudent care there must be, but not an anxious, perplexing thought; let this care be cast upon God. The disciples of Christ must think more how to do well, than how to speak well. In case of great peril, the disciples of Christ may go out of the way of danger, though they must not go out of the way of duty. No sinful, unlawful means may be used to escape; for then it is not a door of God's opening. The fear of man brings a snare, a perplexing snare, that disturbs our peace; an entangling snare, by which we are drawn into sin; and, therefore, it must be striven and prayed against. Tribulation, distress, and persecution cannot take away God's love to them, or theirs to him. Fear Him, who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. They must deliver their message publicly, for all are deeply concerned in the doctrine of the gospel. The whole counsel of God must be made known, Ac 20:27. Christ shows them why they should be of good cheer. Their sufferings witnessed against those who oppose his gospel. When God calls us to speak for him, we may depend on him to teach us what to say. A believing prospect of the end of our troubles, will be of great use to support us under them. They may be borne to the end, because the sufferers shall be borne up under them. The strength shall be according to the day. And it is great encouragement to those who are doing Christ's work, that it is a work which shall certainly be done. See how the care of Providence extends to all creatures, even to the sparrows. This should silence all the fears of God's people; Ye are of more value than many sparrows. And the very hairs of your head are all numbered. This denotes the account God takes and keeps of his people. It is our duty, not only to believe in Christ, but to profess that faith, in suffering for him, when we are called to it, as well as in serving him. That denial of Christ only is here meant which is persisted in, and that confession only can have the blessed recompence here promised, which is the real and constant language of faith and love. Religion is worth every thing; all who believe the truth of it, will come up to the price, and make every thing else yield to it. Christ will lead us through sufferings, to glory with him. Those are best prepared for the life to come, that sit most loose to this present life. Though the kindness done to Christ's disciples be ever so small, yet if there be occasion for it, and ability to do no more, it shall be accepted. Christ does not say that they deserve a reward; for we cannot merit any thing from the hand of God; but they shall receive a reward from the free gift of God. Let us boldly confess Christ, and show love to him in all things.</body></html>
