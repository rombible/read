The words that follow contain a two-fold promise: not only w<span class= "ital">hat</span> they should say, but <span class= "ital">how,</span> in what form and phrase, to say it, should be given them in that hour. The courage of Peter and John before the Sanhedrin is at once the earliest and the most striking instance of the fulfilment of the promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-13.htm" title="Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.">Acts 4:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19, 20.</span> - For these two verses, compare (besides <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-11.htm">Mark 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-15.htm">Luke 21:15</a>; <span class="accented">vide supra</span>, ver. 17) <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-11.htm">Luke 12:11, 12</a>, with which there is doubtless a common basis. As the two verses do not seem to have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12.htm">Luke 12</a>. a very close connexion with their context, it is probable that there also, as here, they are taken from a speech of later date. <span class="cmt_word">But when they deliver you up, take no thought;</span> <span class="accented">be not anxious</span> (Revised Version); <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25</a>, note. So also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-2.htm">Luke 12:2</a>; but <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-14.htm">Luke 21:14</a> goes further, and forbids the disciples to "meditate beforehand how to answer." Bengel says here, <span class="accented">Usa</span>, <span class="accented">non curandi</span>, <span class="accented">cura sit. <span class="cmt_word"></span>How or what</span>. The general direction or the actual matter. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall speak</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in defence, as defined in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-11.htm">Luke 12:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-14.htm">Luke 21:14</a> - <span class="cmt_word">for it shall be given you in that same</span> (omit "same," with the Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">hour what ye shall speak</span>. And if in similar extraordinary circumstances, the Christian may expect similar extraordinary help. The omission of this clause by some Western authorities is probably due to the fact that the next verse also begins with "for," and contains a promise that much resembles this. <span class="cmt_word">For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-38.htm">Genesis 41:38</a>). Observe: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The thoughtful reminder, "your Father," whose children you have become (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>, note), and whose protection you may look for. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It is not said that the Father, but that the Spirit speaks (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-8.htm">Acts 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-9.htm">Acts 13:9</a>; and, for Christ speaking, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-3.htm">2 Corinthians 13:3</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The phrase is quite compatible with, but would hardly have then been understood as expressing, the personality of the Holy Spirit. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Though the promise would doubtless hold good, and that in a special degree, for the most important of all "defences," the writing of Holy Scripture, yet even there it did not preclude the use of human means (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:16-42 Our Lord warned his disciples to prepare for persecution. They were to avoid all things which gave advantage to their enemies, all meddling with worldly or political concerns, all appearance of evil or selfishness, and all underhand measures. Christ foretold troubles, not only that the troubles might not be a surprise, but that they might confirm their faith. He tells them what they should suffer, and from whom. Thus Christ has dealt fairly and faithfully with us, in telling us the worst we can meet with in his service; and he would have us deal so with ourselves, in sitting down and counting the cost. Persecutors are worse than beasts, in that they prey upon those of their own kind. The strongest bonds of love and duty, have often been broken through from enmity against Christ. Sufferings from friends and relations are very grievous; nothing cuts more. It appears plainly, that all who will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution; and we must expect to enter into the kingdom of God through many tribulations. With these predictions of trouble, are counsels and comforts for a time of trial. The disciples of Christ are hated and persecuted as serpents, and their ruin is sought, and they need the serpent's wisdom. Be ye harmless as doves. Not only, do nobody any hurt, but bear nobody any ill-will. Prudent care there must be, but not an anxious, perplexing thought; let this care be cast upon God. The disciples of Christ must think more how to do well, than how to speak well. In case of great peril, the disciples of Christ may go out of the way of danger, though they must not go out of the way of duty. No sinful, unlawful means may be used to escape; for then it is not a door of God's opening. The fear of man brings a snare, a perplexing snare, that disturbs our peace; an entangling snare, by which we are drawn into sin; and, therefore, it must be striven and prayed against. Tribulation, distress, and persecution cannot take away God's love to them, or theirs to him. Fear Him, who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. They must deliver their message publicly, for all are deeply concerned in the doctrine of the gospel. The whole counsel of God must be made known, Ac 20:27. Christ shows them why they should be of good cheer. Their sufferings witnessed against those who oppose his gospel. When God calls us to speak for him, we may depend on him to teach us what to say. A believing prospect of the end of our troubles, will be of great use to support us under them. They may be borne to the end, because the sufferers shall be borne up under them. The strength shall be according to the day. And it is great encouragement to those who are doing Christ's work, that it is a work which shall certainly be done. See how the care of Providence extends to all creatures, even to the sparrows. This should silence all the fears of God's people; Ye are of more value than many sparrows. And the very hairs of your head are all numbered. This denotes the account God takes and keeps of his people. It is our duty, not only to believe in Christ, but to profess that faith, in suffering for him, when we are called to it, as well as in serving him. That denial of Christ only is here meant which is persisted in, and that confession only can have the blessed recompence here promised, which is the real and constant language of faith and love. Religion is worth every thing; all who believe the truth of it, will come up to the price, and make every thing else yield to it. Christ will lead us through sufferings, to glory with him. Those are best prepared for the life to come, that sit most loose to this present life. Though the kindness done to Christ's disciples be ever so small, yet if there be occasion for it, and ability to do no more, it shall be accepted. Christ does not say that they deserve a reward; for we cannot merit any thing from the hand of God; but they shall receive a reward from the free gift of God. Let us boldly confess Christ, and show love to him in all things.</body></html>
