The cities that stood out, in the history of the world, as most conspicuous for their infamy, were yet less guilty (as sinning less against light and knowledge) than those who rejected the messengers of the King. The same comparison reappears with the addition of Tyre and Sidon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-21.htm" title="Woe to you, Chorazin! woe to you, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.">Matthew 11:21</a>.<p><span class= "bld">In the day of judgment.</span>--The phrase, like the Old Testament "day of the Lord," is wider in its range than the thoughts we commonly connect with it, and includes the earlier and more earthly judgments, as well as that which is the great consummation of them all.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-12.htm">Luke 10:12</a> (the seventy). Similar words are used by our Lord in his apostrophe of Capernaum (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-24.htm">Matthew 11:24</a>, where see note). The combination in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-11.htm">Luke 10:11</a> and 12-15 of <span class="accented">both</span> the contexts is an instructive warning against accepting the present position of our Lord's sayings as the final indication of the occasion upon which they were delivered. <span class="cmt_word">Verily</span>. (For the idea of acquiescence that always underlies this word - even in the case of so solemn a matter as the present - comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>, note.) <span class="cmt_word">I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha</span>. Whose inhabitants were the typical example of the worst of sinners (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-32.htm">Deuteronomy 32:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-8.htm">Revelation 11:8</a>). "The men of Sodom have no part in the world to come" (Mishna, 'Sanh.,' 10:3). <span class="cmt_word">In the day of judgment</span>. Luke has "in that day;" cf, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-22.htm">Matthew 7:22</a>. In the only two passages in the LXX. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-34.htm">Proverbs 6:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-8.htm">Isaiah 34:8</a>) where, as it seems, our phrase occurs, it refers, not to the judgment of all, good and bad alike, but to that of the wicked alone. So also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-9.htm">2 Peter 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-7.htm">2 Peter 3:7</a>; and possibly also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36</a>, but not in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-17.htm">1 John 4:17</a> (the only passage where it is not anarthrous). Than for that city. Observe that this verse implies that the wicked dead are still in existence, and are waiting for their final judgment; also that in the judgment of the wicked there will be degrees of punishment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:5-15 The Gentiles must not have the gospel brought them, till the Jews have refused it. This restraint on the apostles was only in their first mission. Wherever they went they must proclaim, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. They preached, to establish the faith; the kingdom, to animate the hope; of heaven, to inspire the love of heavenly things, and the contempt of earthly; which is at hand, that men may prepare for it without delay. Christ gave power to work miracles for the confirming of their doctrine. This is not necessary now that the kingdom of God is come. It showed that the intent of the doctrine they preached, was to heal sick souls, and to raise those that were dead in sin. In proclaiming the gospel of free grace for the healing and saving of men's souls, we must above all avoid the appearance of the spirit of an hireling. They are directed what to do in strange towns and cities. The servant of Christ is the ambassador of peace to whatever place he is sent. His message is even to the vilest sinners, yet it behoves him to find out the best persons in every place. It becomes us to pray heartily for all, and to conduct ourselves courteously to all. They are directed how to act as to those that refused them. The whole counsel of God must be declared, and those who will not attend to the gracious message, must be shown that their state is dangerous. This should be seriously laid to heart by all that hear the gospel, lest their privileges only serve to increase their condemnation.</body></html>
