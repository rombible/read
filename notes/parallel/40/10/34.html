Christ is "our peace" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14</a>), and came to be the one great Peacemaker; and yet the foreseen consequences of His work involved strife and division, and such a consequence, freely accepted for the sake of the greater good that lies beyond it, involves, in fact, a purpose. The words are the natural expression of such a thought; and yet we can hardly fail to connect them with those which, in the earliest dawn of His infancy, revealed to the mother of the Christ that "a sword should pass through her own soul also" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-35.htm" title="(Yes, a sword shall pierce through your own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.">Luke 2:35</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 34-39.</span> <span class="accented">- Fellowship with me will involve separation from the dearest upon earth</span>, <span class="accented">yet the reward is great.</span> (Cf. ver. 5, note.) The progress of thought in these verses seems to be as follows: Do not be surprised at the contradiction that appears between my teaching and the immediate result; I allowed for this when I began my work (ver. 34). There will, indeed, be separation in the closest earthly ties (vers. 35, 36). But my claims are paramount (vers. 37, 38). And on your relation to them depends everything hereafter (ver. 39). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-51.htm">Luke 12:51</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Think not</span>. Christ here removes another mistaken opinion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>, note). There the mistake was about his relation to the Law; here about the immediate result of his coming. The Prince of Peace did not come to cast in peace as something from outside. It would show itself eventually, but from within outwards. That which he cast from without was <span class="accented">fire</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-49.htm">Luke 12:49</a>), a <span class="accented">sword</span> (<span class="accented">infra</span>).

By a natural transition, that phrase led to the thought of "<span class="accented">throwing"</span> peace or a sword. St. Luke, on the contrary, softened the metaphor to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">On</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">earth</span>: <span class="cmt_word">I came not to send peace, but a sword.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:16-42 Our Lord warned his disciples to prepare for persecution. They were to avoid all things which gave advantage to their enemies, all meddling with worldly or political concerns, all appearance of evil or selfishness, and all underhand measures. Christ foretold troubles, not only that the troubles might not be a surprise, but that they might confirm their faith. He tells them what they should suffer, and from whom. Thus Christ has dealt fairly and faithfully with us, in telling us the worst we can meet with in his service; and he would have us deal so with ourselves, in sitting down and counting the cost. Persecutors are worse than beasts, in that they prey upon those of their own kind. The strongest bonds of love and duty, have often been broken through from enmity against Christ. Sufferings from friends and relations are very grievous; nothing cuts more. It appears plainly, that all who will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution; and we must expect to enter into the kingdom of God through many tribulations. With these predictions of trouble, are counsels and comforts for a time of trial. The disciples of Christ are hated and persecuted as serpents, and their ruin is sought, and they need the serpent's wisdom. Be ye harmless as doves. Not only, do nobody any hurt, but bear nobody any ill-will. Prudent care there must be, but not an anxious, perplexing thought; let this care be cast upon God. The disciples of Christ must think more how to do well, than how to speak well. In case of great peril, the disciples of Christ may go out of the way of danger, though they must not go out of the way of duty. No sinful, unlawful means may be used to escape; for then it is not a door of God's opening. The fear of man brings a snare, a perplexing snare, that disturbs our peace; an entangling snare, by which we are drawn into sin; and, therefore, it must be striven and prayed against. Tribulation, distress, and persecution cannot take away God's love to them, or theirs to him. Fear Him, who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. They must deliver their message publicly, for all are deeply concerned in the doctrine of the gospel. The whole counsel of God must be made known, Ac 20:27. Christ shows them why they should be of good cheer. Their sufferings witnessed against those who oppose his gospel. When God calls us to speak for him, we may depend on him to teach us what to say. A believing prospect of the end of our troubles, will be of great use to support us under them. They may be borne to the end, because the sufferers shall be borne up under them. The strength shall be according to the day. And it is great encouragement to those who are doing Christ's work, that it is a work which shall certainly be done. See how the care of Providence extends to all creatures, even to the sparrows. This should silence all the fears of God's people; Ye are of more value than many sparrows. And the very hairs of your head are all numbered. This denotes the account God takes and keeps of his people. It is our duty, not only to believe in Christ, but to profess that faith, in suffering for him, when we are called to it, as well as in serving him. That denial of Christ only is here meant which is persisted in, and that confession only can have the blessed recompence here promised, which is the real and constant language of faith and love. Religion is worth every thing; all who believe the truth of it, will come up to the price, and make every thing else yield to it. Christ will lead us through sufferings, to glory with him. Those are best prepared for the life to come, that sit most loose to this present life. Though the kindness done to Christ's disciples be ever so small, yet if there be occasion for it, and ability to do no more, it shall be accepted. Christ does not say that they deserve a reward; for we cannot merit any thing from the hand of God; but they shall receive a reward from the free gift of God. Let us boldly confess Christ, and show love to him in all things.</body></html>
