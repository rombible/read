The Jewish maxim, that even the very dust of a heathen land brought defilement with it, added to its significance. It was a protest in act, declaring (as our Lord declares in words) that the city or house which did not receive the messengers of the Christ was below the level even of the Gentiles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - If rejected, bear your solemn witness to the fact, for to reject you brings awful consequences. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - Parallel passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-11.htm">Mark 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-5.htm">Luke 9:5</a> (the twelve); 10:10, 11 (the seventy). <span class="cmt_word">And whosoever shall not receive you</span> - on your formal request as heralds of the kingdom - <span class="cmt_word">nor hear your words</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24</a>, note), <span class="cmt_word">when</span> (<span class="accented">as</span>, <span class="accented">R</span>evised Version, ver. 12, note) <span class="cmt_word">ye depart</span> (<span class="accented">go forth</span>, Revised Version) out cf.

This restraint on the apostles was only in their first mission. Wherever they went they must proclaim, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. They preached, to establish the faith; the kingdom, to animate the hope; of heaven, to inspire the love of heavenly things, and the contempt of earthly; which is at hand, that men may prepare for it without delay. Christ gave power to work miracles for the confirming of their doctrine. This is not necessary now that the kingdom of God is come. It showed that the intent of the doctrine they preached, was to heal sick souls, and to raise those that were dead in sin. In proclaiming the gospel of free grace for the healing and saving of men's souls, we must above all avoid the appearance of the spirit of an hireling. They are directed what to do in strange towns and cities. The servant of Christ is the ambassador of peace to whatever place he is sent. His message is even to the vilest sinners, yet it behoves him to find out the best persons in every place. It becomes us to pray heartily for all, and to conduct ourselves courteously to all. They are directed how to act as to those that refused them. The whole counsel of God must be declared, and those who will not attend to the gracious message, must be shown that their state is dangerous. This should be seriously laid to heart by all that hear the gospel, lest their privileges only serve to increase their condemnation.</body></html>
