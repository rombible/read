The habits of Eastern hospitality would throw many houses open to the preachers which would give no openings for their work, or even bring on them an evil report. From these they were to turn away and to seek out some one who, though poor, was yet of good repute, and willing to receive them as messengers of glad tidings.<p><span class= "bld">There abide.</span>--The purpose of the rule was (1) to guard against fickleness, as in itself an evil; and (2) against the tendency to go from one house to another according to the advantages which were offered to the guest.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - Parallel passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-10.htm">Mark 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-4.htm">Luke 9:4</a> (the twelve); 10:5-8 (the seventy). Matthew alone mentions the command to inquire who is worthy. <span class="cmt_word">And into whatsoever city or town</span>; <span class="accented">village</span> (Revised Version); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-35.htm">Matthew 9:35</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall enter, inquire</span>; <span class="accented">search out</span> (Revised Version). Much more is implied than merely asking some chance passer-by (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-8.htm">Matthew 2:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who in it is worthy</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> equivalent by moral rate (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) - in this case to the privilege of your lodging with him; elsewhere to the offer of peace (ver. 13), to the favour of an invitation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-8.htm">Matthew 22:8</a>), to walking with Christ clothed in white (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3.htm">Revelation 3</a>:47, to punishment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-6.htm">Revelation 16:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And there abide till ye go thence;</span> <span class="accented">go forth</span> (Revised Version); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> finally (ver. 14). The object of this command, which was reckoned so important as to be recorded in all three parallel passages (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>), <span class="accented">is</span> to prevent; partly favouritism and rivalry, partly waste of time. For "when a stranger arrives in a village or an encampment, the neighbours, one after another, must invite him to eat with them. There is a strict etiquette about it, involving much ostentation and hypocrisy; and a failure in the due observance of this system of hospitality is violently resented, and often leads to alienations and feuds among neighbours. It also consumes much time, causes unusual distraction of mind, leads to levity, and every way counteracts the success of a spiritual mission" (Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' p. 347); cf. St. Luke's "Go not from house to house" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>). It is, on the other hand, quite unnecessary to see here, with Meyer and Weiss, a prohibition to go to the synagogues or indeed to anywhere else where they could gain a hearing during their stay. Our Lord is referring only to lodging and food (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:5-15 The Gentiles must not have the gospel brought them, till the Jews have refused it. This restraint on the apostles was only in their first mission. Wherever they went they must proclaim, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. They preached, to establish the faith; the kingdom, to animate the hope; of heaven, to inspire the love of heavenly things, and the contempt of earthly; which is at hand, that men may prepare for it without delay. Christ gave power to work miracles for the confirming of their doctrine. This is not necessary now that the kingdom of God is come. It showed that the intent of the doctrine they preached, was to heal sick souls, and to raise those that were dead in sin. In proclaiming the gospel of free grace for the healing and saving of men's souls, we must above all avoid the appearance of the spirit of an hireling. They are directed what to do in strange towns and cities. The servant of Christ is the ambassador of peace to whatever place he is sent. His message is even to the vilest sinners, yet it behoves him to find out the best persons in every place. It becomes us to pray heartily for all, and to conduct ourselves courteously to all. They are directed how to act as to those that refused them. The whole counsel of God must be declared, and those who will not attend to the gracious message, must be shown that their state is dangerous. This should be seriously laid to heart by all that hear the gospel, lest their privileges only serve to increase their condemnation.</body></html>
