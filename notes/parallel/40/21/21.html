The phrase to "remove mountains" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-2.htm" title="And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.">1Corinthians 13:2</a>) was a natural hyperbole for overcoming difficulties, and our Lord in pointing to "this mountain"--as He had done before to Hermon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-20.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief: for truly I say to you, If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.">Matthew 17:20</a>)--did but give greater vividness to an illustration which the disciples would readily understand. A mere physical miracle, such as the removal of the mountain, could never be in itself the object of the prayer of a faith such as our Lord described. The hyperbole is used here, as elsewhere, to impress on men's mind the truth which lies beneath it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered.</span> To the apostles' question the Lord makes reply, drawing a lesson, not such as we should have expected, but one of quite a different nature, yet one which was naturally deduced from the transaction which had excited such astonishment. They marvelled at this incident; let them have and exercise faith. and they should do greater things than this. Christ had already made a similar answer after the cure of the demoniac boy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>, where see note). <span class="cmt_word">If ye have faith, and doubt not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). The whole phrase expresses the perfection of the grace. The latter verb means "to discriminate," to see a difference in things, hence to debate in one's mind. The Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">Si habueritis fidem, et non haesitaveritis</span>. What is here enjoined is that temper of mind which does not stop hesitatingly to consider whether a thing can be done or not, but believes that all is possible - that one can do all things through Christ who strengthens him. So the apostles are assured by Christ that they should not only be able to wither a tree with a word, but should accomplish far more difficult undertakings. <span class="cmt_word">This</span> which is done to <span class="cmt_word">the fig tree</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>); as, "what was befallen to them that were possessed with devils (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-33.htm">Matthew 8:33</a>). The promise may intimate that it was to be through the preaching of the apostles, and the Jews' rejection of the salvation offered by them, that the judgment should fall on the chosen people. Thus they would do what was done to the fig tree. And in the following words we may see a prophecy of the destruction of the mountain of paganism. Or it may mean that theocratic Judaism must be cast into the sea of nations before the Church of Christ should reach its full development (Lange). <span class="cmt_word">This mountain.</span> As he speaks, he points to the Mount of Olivet, on which they were standing, or to Moriah crowned by the glorious temple. <span class="cmt_word">Be thou removed;</span> <span class="accented">be thou taken up</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, not the same word as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The sea.</span> The Mediterranean (see a similar promise, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-6.htm">Luke 17:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">It shall be done.</span> It was not likely that any such material miracle would literally be needed, and no one would ever pray for such a sign; but the expression is hyperbolically used to denote the performance of things most difficult and apparently impossible (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-7.htm">Zechariah 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:18-22 This cursing of the barren fig-tree represents the state of hypocrites in general, and so teaches us that Christ looks for the power of religion in those who profess it, and the savour of it from those that have the show of it. His just expectations from flourishing professors are often disappointed; he comes to many, seeking fruit, and finds leaves only. A false profession commonly withers in this world, and it is the effect of Christ's curse. The fig-tree that had no fruit, soon lost its leaves. This represents the state of the nation and people of the Jews in particular. Our Lord Jesus found among them nothing but leaves. And after they rejected Christ, blindness and hardness grew upon them, till they were undone, and their place and nation rooted up. The Lord was righteous in it. Let us greatly fear the doom denounced on the barren fig-tree.</body></html>
