We have to think of the journey up the narrow valley that leads from Jericho to Jerusalem. Our Lord, as before, was followed by the disciples, and they in their turn were followed by the crowds of pilgrims who were drawn to the Holy City either by the coming Passover or by wonder and curiosity to see what part the Prophet of Nazareth would take. Throughout the multitude, including the disciples, there was a feverish expectation that He would at last announce Himself as the Christ, and claim His kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-11.htm" title="And as they heard these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.">Luke 19:11</a>). They reach Bethany "six days before the Passover," probably, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> on the Friday afternoon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-1.htm" title="Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.">John 12:1</a>). They remain there for the Sabbath, probably in the house of Lazarus or Simon the leper (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-6.htm" title="Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,">Matthew 26:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-2.htm" title="There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.">John 12:2</a>; and in that of the latter we have the history of the anointing, which St. Matthew relates, out of its chronological order, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/26-6.htm" title="Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,">Matthew 26:6-13</a>). The point of time with which the narrative, which now becomes more continuous, opens, may be fixed at the dawn of the first day of the week, the daybreak of Palm Sunday.<p><span class= "bld">Bethphage.</span>--The village is named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he was come near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,">Luke 19:29</a>, and in many MSS. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-1.htm" title="And when they came near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sends forth two of his disciples,">Mark 11:1</a>, in conjunction with Bethany, and before it, and from this it would seem probable that it lay on the road from Jericho, and was therefore to the east of Bethany. The traditional site, however, followed in most maps, makes it to the west of Bethany, and nearer the summit of the hill. The name signified "the house of unripe figs," as Bethany did "the house of dates," and Gethsemane "the oil-press," the three obviously indicating local features giving distinctness to the three sites. All three were on the Mount of Olives. Bethany is identified with the modern <span class= "ital">El-'Azariyeh,</span> or <span class= "ital">Lazarieh</span> (the name attaching to its connection with the history of Lazarus), which lies about a mile below the summit on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives, in a woody hollow planted with olives, almonds, pomegranates, and figs. The palms implied in the name of Bethany and in the history of the entry into Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-13.htm" title="Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that comes in the name of the Lord.">John 12:13</a>) have disappeared.<p><span class= "bld">Two disciples.</span>--The messengers are not named in any of the Gospels. The fact that Peter and John were sent on a like errand in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-8.htm" title="And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.">Luke 22:8</a> makes it, perhaps, probable that they were employed in this instance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> - <span class="accented">Triumphal entry into Jerusalem</span>. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-1.htm">Mark 11:1-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-29.htm">Luke 19:29-44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-12.htm">John 12:12-19</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - We have come to the last week of our Lord's earthly life, when he made his appearance in Jerusalem as Messiah, and suffered the penalty of death. If, as is believed, his crucifixion took place on the fourteenth day of the month Nisan, the triumphal entry must be assigned to the ninth, which day was reckoned to commence at one sunset and to continue till the follow-lug evening. This is regarded as the first day of the Holy Week, and is called by Christians from very early times Palm Sunday (see on ver. 10). He had probably gone straight from Jericho to Bethany. and spent the sabbath there with his friends (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-1.htm">John 12:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Bethphage</span>. The name means <span class="accented">House of figs</span>, and was appropriate to a locality where such trees grew luxuriantly. The village has not been identified with certainty, though it is considered with great probability to be represented by <span class="accented">Kefr-et-Tur</span>, on a summit of Olivet, within the bounds of Jerusalem, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. two thousand cubits' distance from the city walls. Bethany is below the summit, in a nook on the western slope and somewhat further from the city. The Mount of Olives is separated from Jerusalem by the valley of the Kedron, and has three summits, the centre one being the highest; but though it is of no great elevation in itself, it stands nearly four thousand feet above the Dead Sea, from which it is distant some thirteen miles. <span class="cmt_word">Then sent Jesus two disciples.</span> Their names are not given, and it is useless to conjecture who they were, though probably Peter was one of them. Alford suggests that the triumphal entry in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11.htm">Mark 11</a>. is related a day too soon, and that our Lord made two entries into Jerusalem - the first a private one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-11.htm">Mark 11:11</a>), and the second, public, on the morrow But there is no sufficient reason to discredit the common tradition, and St. Mark's language can be otherwise explained. The deliberate preparation for t. he procession, and the intentional publicity, so contrary to Christ's usual habits, are very remarkable, and can be explained only by the fact that he was now assuming the character and claims of Messiah, and putting himself forward in his true dignity and office as "King of the Jews." By this display he made manifest that in him prophecy was fulfilled, and that the seeing eye and the believing heart might now find all that righteous men had long and wearily desired. This was the great opportunity which his mercy offered to Jerusalem, if only she would accept it and turn it to account. In fact, she acknowledged him as King one day, and then rejected and crucified him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-11 This coming of Christ was described by the prophet Zechariah, Zec 9:9. When Christ would appear in his glory, it is in his meekness, not in his majesty, in mercy to work salvation. As meekness and outward poverty were fully seen in Zion's King, and marked his triumphal entrance to Jerusalem, how wrong covetousness, ambition, and the pride of life must be in Zion's citizens! They brought the ass, but Jesus did not use it without the owner's consent. The trappings were such as came to hand. We must not think the clothes on our backs too dear to part with for the service of Christ. The chief priests and the elders afterwards joined with the multitude that abused him upon the cross; but none of them joined the multitude that did him honour. Those that take Christ for their King, must lay their all under his feet. Hosanna signifies, Save now, we beseech thee! Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord! But of how little value is the applause of the people! The changing multitude join the cry of the day, whether it be Hosanna, or Crucify him. Multitudes often seem to approve the gospel, but few become consistent disciples. When Jesus was come into Jerusalem all the city was moved; some perhaps were moved with joy, who waited for the Consolation of Israel; others, of the Pharisees, were moved with envy. So various are the motions in the minds of men upon the approach of Christ's kingdom.</body></html>
