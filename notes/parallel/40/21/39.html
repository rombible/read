This is prophecy, and alludes to a particular circumstance attending the death of Christ, viz. that he suffered without the city Jerusalem, Calvary being outside the walls (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-17.htm">John 19:17</a>, and the parallel passages in the other evangelists, and especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11, 12</a>, where it is significantly noted that Jesus "suffered without the gate"). The words may also contain a reference to the fact that he was excommunicated and given over to the heathen to be judged and condemned, thus suffering not actually at the hands of "the husbandmen" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27</a>). Christ, in his Divine prescience, speaks of his Passion and death as already accomplished. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:33-46 This parable plainly sets forth the sin and ruin of the Jewish nation; and what is spoken to convict them, is spoken to caution all that enjoy the privileges of the outward church. As men treat God's people, they would treat Christ himself, if he were with them. How can we, if faithful to his cause, expect a favourable reception from a wicked world, or from ungodly professors of Christianity! And let us ask ourselves, whether we who have the vineyard and all its advantages, render fruits in due season, as a people, as a family, or as separate persons. Our Saviour, in his question, declares that the Lord of the vineyard will come, and when he comes he will surely destroy the wicked. The chief priests and the elders were the builders, and they would not admit his doctrine or laws; they threw him aside as a despised stone. But he who was rejected by the Jews, was embraced by the Gentiles. Christ knows who will bring forth gospel fruits in the use of gospel means. The unbelief of sinners will be their ruin. But God has many ways of restraining the remainders of wrath, as he has of making that which breaks out redound to his praise. May Christ become more and more precious to our souls, as the firm Foundation and Cornerstone of his church. May we be willing to follow him, though despised and hated for his sake.</body></html>
