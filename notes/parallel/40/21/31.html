They who gave God thanks that they were not like other men, could not imagine for an instant that the "went not" represented their spiritual life in relation to God's kingdom.<p><span class= "bld">The publicans and the harlots.</span>--The words are purposely general, as describing the action of classes; but we cannot help associating them with the personal instances of the publican who became an Apostle (9:9), and of Zacchaeus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/19-2.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.">Luke 19:2-10</a>), and of the woman that was a sinner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/7-37.htm" title="And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,">Luke 7:37-50</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Go into the kingdom of God before you.</span>--Which literally means, <span class= "ital">lead the way into.</span> What follows shows that our Lord is stating not so much a law of God's government as a simple fact. The choice of the word is significant as implying that there was still time for scribes and Pharisees to follow in the rear. The door was not yet closed against them, though those whom they despised had taken the place of honour and preceded them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whether of them</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>twain!</span> Christ forces from the unwilling hearers an answer which, at the moment, they do not see will condemn themselves. Unaccustomed to be criticized and put to the question, wrapped in a self-complacent righteousness, which was generally undisturbed, they missed the bearing of the parable on their own case, and answered without hesitation, as any unprejudiced person would have decided. <span class="cmt_word">The first;</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the son who first refused, but afterwards repented and went. <span class="cmt_word">Verily I say unto you.</span> Jesus drives the moral home to the hearts of these hypocrites. <span class="cmt_word">The publicans and the harlots.</span> He specifies these excommunicated sinners as examples of those represented by the first son. <span class="cmt_word">Go into the kingdom of God before you;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">are preceding you</span>. This was the fact which Jesus saw and declared, he does not cut off all hope that the Pharisees might follow, if they willed to do so; he only shows that they have lost the position which they ought to have occupied, and that those whom they despised and spurned have accepted the offered salvation, and shall have their reward. We must remark that the Lord has no censure for those who sometime were disobedient, but afterwards repented; his rebuke falls on the professors and self-righteous, who ought to have been leaders and guides, and were in truth impious and irreligious. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:28-32 Parables which give reproof, speak plainly to the offenders, and judge them out of their own mouths. The parable of the two sons sent to work in the vineyard, is to show that those who knew not John's baptism to be of God, were shamed by those who knew it, and owned it. The whole human race are like children whom the Lord has brought up, but they have rebelled against him, only some are more plausible in their disobedience than others. And it often happens, that the daring rebel is brought to repentance and becomes the Lord's servant, while the formalist grows hardened in pride and enmity.</body></html>
