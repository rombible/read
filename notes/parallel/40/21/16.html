The shouts of the children were therefore a surprise to them, and they turned to the Teacher and asked whether He accepted them in the sense in which they were addressed to Him. Had He really entered the Temple claiming to be the expected Christ? Did He approve this interruption of the order and quiet of its courts?<p><span class= "bld">Have ye never read?</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">did ye never read?</span> The question was one which our Lord frequently asked in reasoning with the scribes who opposed Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-3.htm" title="But he said to them, Have you not read what David did, when he was an hungered, and they that were with him;">Matthew 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-5.htm" title="Or have you not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?">Matthew 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-4.htm" title="And he answered and said to them, Have you not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,">Matthew 19:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-42.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Did you never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?">Matthew 21:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-31.htm" title="But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,">Matthew 22:31</a>). It expressed very forcibly the estimate which He formed of their character as interpreters. They spent their lives in the study of the Law, and yet they perverted its meaning, and could not see its bearing on the events that passed around them. In this instance He cites the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-2.htm" title="Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings have you ordained strength because of your enemies, that you might still the enemy and the avenger.">Psalm 8:2</a>, the primary meaning of which appears to be that the child's wonder at the marvels of Creation is the truest worship. As applied by our Lord their lesson was the same. The cries of the children were the utterance of a truth which the priests and scribes rejected. To Him, to whom the innocent brightness of childhood was a delight, they were more acceptable than the half-hearted, self-seeking homage of older worshippers. The words are quoted from the LXX. translation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hearest thou what these say?</span> They profess a great zeal for God's honour. They recognize that these cries implied high homage, if not actual worship, and appeal to Jesus to put a stop to such unseemly behaviour, approaching, as they would pretend, to formal blasphemy. <span class="cmt_word">Yea</span>. Jesus replies that he hears what the children say, but sees no reason for silencing them; rather he proves that they were only fulfilling an old prophecy, originally, indeed, applied to Jehovah, but one which he claims as addressed to himself. <span class="cmt_word">Have ye never read?</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-5.htm">Matthew 12:5</a>). The quotation is from the confessedly Messianic psalm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8</a>.), a psalm very often quoted in the New Testament, and as speaking of Christ (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-27.htm">1 Corinthians 15:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-6.htm">Hebrews 2:6</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Sucklings</span>. This term was applied to children up to the age of three years (see 2 Macc. 7:27), but might be used metaphorically of those of tender age, though long weaned. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast perfected praise.</span> The words are from the Septuagint, which seems to have preserved the original reading. The present Hebrew text gives, "Thou hast ordained strength," or "established a power." In the Lord's mouth the citation signifies that God is praised acceptably by the weak and ignorant when, following the impulse of their simple nature, they do him homage. Some expositors combine the force of the Hebrew and Greek by explaining that "the strength of the weak is praise, and that worship of Christ is strength" (Wordsworth). It is more simple to say, with Nosgen, that for the Hebrew "strength," "praise" is substituted, in order to give the idea that the children's acclamation was that which would still the enemy, as it certainly put to shame the captious objections of the Pharisees. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:12-17 Christ found some of the courts of the temple turned into a market for cattle and things used in the sacrifices, and partly occupied by the money-changers. Our Lord drove them from the place, as he had done at his entering upon his ministry, Joh 2:13-17. His works testified of him more than the hosannas; and his healing in the temple was the fulfilling the promise, that the glory of the latter house should be greater than the glory of the former. If Christ came now into many parts of his visible church, how many secret evils he would discover and cleanse! And how many things daily practised under the cloak of religion, would he show to be more suitable to a den of thieves than to a house of prayer!</body></html>
