In the primary meaning of the Psalm, the illustration seems to have been drawn from one of the stones, quarried, hewn, and marked, away from the site of the Temple, which the builders, ignorant of the head architect's plans, had put on one side, as having no place in the building, but which was found afterwards to be that on which the completeness of the structure depended, that on which, as the chief corner-stone, the two walls met and were bonded together. The Psalmist saw in this a parable of the choice of David to be king over Israel; perhaps, also, of the choice of Israel itself out of the nations of the world. Elsewhere, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm" title="And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;">Ephesians 2:20</a>, and in the language of later ages, Christ Himself is the chief corner-stone. Here the context gives a somewhat different application, and "the stone which the builders rejected" is found in the future converts from among the Gentiles, the nation bringing forth the fruits which Israel had not brought forth--the "corner-stone" of the great edifice of the Catholic Church of Christ. This meaning was obviously not incompatible with the other. As the mind of the Psalmist included both David and Israel under the same symbolism, so here the Christ identifies Himself, more or less completely, with the Church which is His body. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-22.htm" title="And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,">Ephesians 1:22-23</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Did ye never read?</span> It is as though Christ said, "Ye have answered rightly. You profess to know the Scriptures well; do you not, then, apprehend that Holy Writ foretells that concerning Messiah and his enemies which you have just announced?" The imagery is changed, but the subject is the same as in the preceding parable. The vineyard is now a building; the husbandmen are the builders; the Son is the stone. <span class="cmt_word">In the Scriptures.</span> The quotation is from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22, 23</a> - the same psalm which was used on the day of triumph when Christ was saluted with cries of "Hosanna!" and which, as some say, was first sung by Israel at the Feast of Tabernacles on the return from Captivity. <span class="cmt_word">The stone.</span> This figure was generally understood to represent Messiah, on whom depended the existence and support of the kingdom of God. Many prophecies containing this metaphor were applied to him; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-34.htm">Daniel 2:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-9.htm">Zechariah 3:9</a>; so that the Pharisees could be at no loss to understand the allusion, seeing that Jesus claimed to be that Stone. <span class="cmt_word">Rejected;</span> as being not suitable to the building, or useless in its construction. So the husbandmen rejected the Son. The ignorance and contempt of men are overruled by the great Architect. <span class="cmt_word">The head of the corner.</span> The cornerstone, which stands at the base and binds together two principal walls (see St. Paul's grand words, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>). We learn that Christ unites Jew and Gentile in one holy house (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6, 7</a>). This (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>), being feminine, is thought by some to refer to "head of the corner" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); but it is better to take it as used by a Hebrew idiom for the neuter, and to refer generally to what has preceded, viz. the settlement of the cornerstone in its destined position, which is effected by the Lord himself. The ultimate victory of the rejected Son is thus distinctly predicted (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:33-46 This parable plainly sets forth the sin and ruin of the Jewish nation; and what is spoken to convict them, is spoken to caution all that enjoy the privileges of the outward church. As men treat God's people, they would treat Christ himself, if he were with them. How can we, if faithful to his cause, expect a favourable reception from a wicked world, or from ungodly professors of Christianity! And let us ask ourselves, whether we who have the vineyard and all its advantages, render fruits in due season, as a people, as a family, or as separate persons. Our Saviour, in his question, declares that the Lord of the vineyard will come, and when he comes he will surely destroy the wicked. The chief priests and the elders were the builders, and they would not admit his doctrine or laws; they threw him aside as a despised stone. But he who was rejected by the Jews, was embraced by the Gentiles. Christ knows who will bring forth gospel fruits in the use of gospel means. The unbelief of sinners will be their ruin. But God has many ways of restraining the remainders of wrath, as he has of making that which breaks out redound to his praise. May Christ become more and more precious to our souls, as the firm Foundation and Cornerstone of his church. May we be willing to follow him, though despised and hated for his sake.</body></html>
