If it were not so it would not be asked in faith, and every true prayer involves the submission of what it asks to the divine judgment. The words suggest the thought, of which we have the full expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-42.htm" title="And I knew that you hear me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that you have sent me.">John 11:42</a>, that our Lord's miracles were less frequently wrought by an inherent supernatural "virtue"--though this, also, distinctly appears, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in the history of the woman with the issue of blood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-46.htm" title="And Jesus said, Somebody has touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.">Luke 8:46</a>)--than by power received from the Father, and in answer to His own prayers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All things.</span> The promise is extended beyond the sphere of extraordinary miracles. <span class="cmt_word">In prayer;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1fc7;</span>: <span class="accented">in the prayer</span>; or, in your prayer.

A man must have no latent doubt in his heart; he must not debate whether the thing desired can be done or not; he must have absolute trust in the power and good will of God; and he must believe that "what he saith cometh to pass" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-23.htm">Mark 11:23</a>). The faith required is the assurance of things hoped for, such as gives substance and being to them while yet out of sight. The words had their special application to the apostles, instructing them that they were not to expect to be able, like their Master, to work the wonders needed for the confirmation of the gospel by their own power. Such effects could be achieved only by prayer and faith. (On the general promise to faithful prayer, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7-11</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:18-22 This cursing of the barren fig-tree represents the state of hypocrites in general, and so teaches us that Christ looks for the power of religion in those who profess it, and the savour of it from those that have the show of it. His just expectations from flourishing professors are often disappointed; he comes to many, seeking fruit, and finds leaves only. A false profession commonly withers in this world, and it is the effect of Christ's curse. The fig-tree that had no fruit, soon lost its leaves. This represents the state of the nation and people of the Jews in particular. Our Lord Jesus found among them nothing but leaves. And after they rejected Christ, blindness and hardness grew upon them, till they were undone, and their place and nation rooted up. The Lord was righteous in it. Let us greatly fear the doom denounced on the barren fig-tree.</body></html>
