So Jehu, when the officers of the army of Israel chose him as their ruler, walked upon the garments which they spread beneath his feet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-13.htm" title="Then they hurried, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.">2Kings 9:13</a>). So Agamemnon, tempted to an act of barbaric pomp, after the manner of Eastern kings, entered his palace at Mycenae, walking upon costly carpets ('schylus, <span class= "ital">Agam.</span> 891).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A very great multitude;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: Revised Version, <span class="accented">the most part of the multitude</span>. This interpretation has classical authority (see Alford), but the words may well mean," the very great multitude;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">plurima autem turba</span>. This crowd was composed of pilgrims who were coming to the festival at Jerusalem, and "the whole multitude of the disciples" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-37.htm">Luke 19:37</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Spread their garments</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">in the way.</span> Fired with enthusiasm, they stripped off their abbas, as the two disciples had done, and with them made a carpet over which the Saviour should ride. Such honours were often paid to great men, and indeed, as we well know, are offered now on state occasions. <span class="cmt_word">Branches from the trees</span>. St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-13.htm">John 12:13</a>) particularizes palm trees as having been used on this occasion; but there was abundance of olive and other trees, from which branches and leaves could be cut or plucked to adorn the Saviour's road. The people appear to have behaved on this occasion as if at the Feast of Tabernacles, roused by enthusiasm to unpremeditated action. Of the three routes which lay before him, Jesus is supposed to have taken the southern and most frequented, between the Mount of Olives and the Hill of Offence. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-11 This coming of Christ was described by the prophet Zechariah, Zec 9:9. When Christ would appear in his glory, it is in his meekness, not in his majesty, in mercy to work salvation. As meekness and outward poverty were fully seen in Zion's King, and marked his triumphal entrance to Jerusalem, how wrong covetousness, ambition, and the pride of life must be in Zion's citizens! They brought the ass, but Jesus did not use it without the owner's consent. The trappings were such as came to hand. We must not think the clothes on our backs too dear to part with for the service of Christ. The chief priests and the elders afterwards joined with the multitude that abused him upon the cross; but none of them joined the multitude that did him honour. Those that take Christ for their King, must lay their all under his feet. Hosanna signifies, Save now, we beseech thee! Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord! But of how little value is the applause of the people! The changing multitude join the cry of the day, whether it be Hosanna, or Crucify him. Multitudes often seem to approve the gospel, but few become consistent disciples. When Jesus was come into Jerusalem all the city was moved; some perhaps were moved with joy, who waited for the Consolation of Israel; others, of the Pharisees, were moved with envy. So various are the motions in the minds of men upon the approach of Christ's kingdom.</body></html>
