"The Lord" may be used either (1) in the highest sense as equivalent to Jehovah, as though the ass and the colt were claimed for His service; or (2) as referring to Christ in the special sense in which He was spoken of as "the Lord" by His disciples; or (3) as pointing to Him, but only in the language which all men would acknowledge, and without any special claim beyond that of being the Master whom the disciples owned as in a lower sense their Lord. Of these (3) is all but excluded by the facts of the case. The words involve a claim to more than common authority, and the claim is recognised at once. In favour of (2) we have the numerous instances in which the disciples and the evangelists not only address their Master as "Lord," but speak of Him as "the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-6.htm" title="He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.">Matthew 28:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-19.htm" title="So then after the Lord had spoken to them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.">Mark 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-1.htm" title="After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, where he himself would come.">Luke 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-6.htm" title="And the Lord said, If you had faith as a grain of mustard seed, you might say to this sycamine tree, Be you plucked up by the root, and be you planted in the sea; and it should obey you.">Luke 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-6.htm" title="And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge said.">Luke 18:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-2.htm" title="(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)">John 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-13.htm" title="You call me Master and Lord: and you say well; for so I am.">John 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-2.htm" title="Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.">John 20:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-13.htm" title="And they say to her, Woman, why weep you? She said to them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they have laid him.">John 20:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-18.htm" title="Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the LORD, and that he had spoken these things to her.">John 20:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-20.htm" title="And when he had so said, he showed to them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD.">John 20:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-25.htm" title="The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the LORD. But he said to them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.">John 20:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-7.htm" title="Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat to him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.">John 21:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-12.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples dared ask him, Who are you? knowing that it was the Lord.">John 21:12</a>). For (1), lastly, we have our Lord's use of the word as a synonym for God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-19.htm" title="However, Jesus suffered him not, but said to him, Go home to your friends, and tell them how great things the Lord has done for you, and has had compassion on you.">Mark 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-20.htm" title="And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he has chosen, he has shortened the days.">Mark 13:20</a>). On the whole (2) appears to commend itself as most in accordance with the customary language of the disciples. On the very probable assumption that the owners of the colt were, in some sense, themselves disciples, they would recognise the full import of the words thus addressed to them, and obey without hesitation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Say aught unto you</span>. This might naturally be expected. Christ foresaw the opposition, and instructed the disciples how to overcome it with a word. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to "Jehovah," or the King Messiah. Doubtless the owner of the animals was a disciple, and acknowledged the claims of Jesus. His presence here was a providentially guided coincidence. If he was a stranger; as others suppose, be must have been divinely prompted to acquiesce in the appropriation of his beasts. <span class="cmt_word">He will send them.</span> Some manuscripts read, "he sends them," here, as in St. Mark. The present is more forcible, but the future is well attested. The simple announcement that the asses were needed for God's service would silence all refusal. The disciples, indeed, were to act at once, as executing the orders of the supreme Lord, and were to use the given answer only in case of any objection. Throughout the transaction Christ assumes the character of the Divine Messiah, King of his people, the real Owner of all that they possess. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-11 This coming of Christ was described by the prophet Zechariah, Zec 9:9. When Christ would appear in his glory, it is in his meekness, not in his majesty, in mercy to work salvation. As meekness and outward poverty were fully seen in Zion's King, and marked his triumphal entrance to Jerusalem, how wrong covetousness, ambition, and the pride of life must be in Zion's citizens! They brought the ass, but Jesus did not use it without the owner's consent. The trappings were such as came to hand. We must not think the clothes on our backs too dear to part with for the service of Christ. The chief priests and the elders afterwards joined with the multitude that abused him upon the cross; but none of them joined the multitude that did him honour. Those that take Christ for their King, must lay their all under his feet. Hosanna signifies, Save now, we beseech thee! Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord! But of how little value is the applause of the people! The changing multitude join the cry of the day, whether it be Hosanna, or Crucify him. Multitudes often seem to approve the gospel, but few become consistent disciples. When Jesus was come into Jerusalem all the city was moved; some perhaps were moved with joy, who waited for the Consolation of Israel; others, of the Pharisees, were moved with envy. So various are the motions in the minds of men upon the approach of Christ's kingdom.</body></html>
