By this and the succeeding parables, Jesus shows his interlocutors their true guilty position and the punishment that awaited them. He himself explains the present parable in reference to his hearers, though, of course, it has, and is meant to have, a much wider application. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> certain <span class="cmt_word">man</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">a man</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>had two sons.</span> The man represents God; the two sons symbolize two classes of Jews - the Pharisees, with their followers and imitators; and the lawless and sinful, who made no pretence of religion. The former are those who profess to keep the Law strictly, to the very letter, though they care nothing for its spirit, and virtually divorce religion from morality The latter are careless and profane persons, whom the Lord calls "publicans and harlots" (ver. 31). <span class="cmt_word">The first.</span> Westcott and Hort, relying on no very weighty authority, reverse the order of the sons' answers, altering ver. 31 in agreement with this arrangement. Christ's reply countenances the received text, setting the repentant before the professing son. It is a matter of small importance (see Tischendorf, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). "The first son "here typifies the evil and immoral among the Jewish people. <span class="cmt_word">Go</span>, <span class="accented">work</span> <span class="cmt_word">today.</span> Two emphatic imperatives. Immediate obedience is required. "Today, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7, 8</a>). God called his sons to serve in his <span class="cmt_word">vineyard</span> - the Church. He called them by the prophets, and more especially by John the Baptist, to turn from evil ways, and to do works meet for repentance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-8.htm">Matthew 3:8</a>). Christ gives two examples, showing how this call was received. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:28-32 Parables which give reproof, speak plainly to the offenders, and judge them out of their own mouths. The parable of the two sons sent to work in the vineyard, is to show that those who knew not John's baptism to be of God, were shamed by those who knew it, and owned it. The whole human race are like children whom the Lord has brought up, but they have rebelled against him, only some are more plausible in their disobedience than others. And it often happens, that the daring rebel is brought to repentance and becomes the Lord's servant, while the formalist grows hardened in pride and enmity.</body></html>
