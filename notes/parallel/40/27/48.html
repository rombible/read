The sponge had probably served instead of a cork to the jar in which the soldiers had brought the drink that was to sustain them in their long day's work. Some one, whether soldier or Jew we know not, heard, not only the cry, "Eli, Eli, . . ." but the faint "I thirst," which St. John records as coming from the fevered lips (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-28.htm" title="After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst.">John 19:28</a>), and prompted by a rough pity, stretched out a cane, or stalk of hyssop (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-29.htm" title="Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it on hyssop, and put it to his mouth.">John 19:29</a>), with the sponge that had been dipped in the wine upon it, and bore it to the parched lips of the Sufferer. It was not now refused (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-30.htm" title="When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.">John 19:30</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And gave him to drink.</span>--The Greek verb is in the imperfect tense, as implying that while he was doing this, the others tried to interrupt him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 48.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ran, and took a sponge.</span> According to St. John, Jesus had just said, "I thirst."

Thus was fulfilled the psalmist's word, "In my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:45-50 During the three hours which the darkness continued, Jesus was in agony, wrestling with the powers of darkness, and suffering his Father's displeasure against the sin of man, for which he was now making his soul an offering. Never were there three such hours since the day God created man upon the earth, never such a dark and awful scene; it was the turning point of that great affair, man's redemption and salvation. Jesus uttered a complaint from Ps 22:1. Hereby he teaches of what use the word of God is to direct us in prayer, and recommends the use of Scripture expressions in prayer. The believer may have tasted some drops of bitterness, but he can only form a very feeble idea of the greatness of Christ's sufferings. Yet, hence he learns something of the Saviour's love to sinners; hence he gets deeper conviction of the vileness and evil of sin, and of what he owes to Christ, who delivers him from the wrath to come. His enemies wickedly ridiculed his complaint. Many of the reproaches cast upon the word of God and the people of God, arise, as here, from gross mistakes. Christ, just before he expired, spake in his full strength, to show that his life was not forced from him, but was freely delivered into his Father's hands. He had strength to bid defiance to the powers of death: and to show that by the eternal Spirit he offered himself, being the Priest as well as the Sacrifice, he cried with a loud voice. Then he yielded up the ghost. The Son of God upon the cross, did die by the violence of the pain he was put to. His soul was separated from his body, and so his body was left really and truly dead. It was certain that Christ did die, for it was needful that he should die. He had undertaken to make himself an offering for sin, and he did it when he willingly gave up his life.</body></html>
