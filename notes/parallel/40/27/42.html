He had come into the world to save others, regardless of Himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">saved others.</span> They knew something of his many miracles of healing; many among them had witnessed the cure of the man blind from his birth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9.htm">John 9</a>.); most must have heard of the raising of Lazarus; - they made these very works of mercy a reproach against him. He had proved himself a beneficent Saviour; he had shown superhuman power, and yet they say, <span class="cmt_word">Himself he cannot save.</span> There was indeed a sense, not their sense, in which this was true. Christ willed to die; it was his purpose thus to redeem mankind; in adhering to this steadfast determination he could not deliver himself from suffering and death. Some read the clause interrogatively, "Cannot he save himself?" It is then parallel to the expression used at the grave of Lazarus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-37.htm">John 11:37</a>). <span class="cmt_word">If he be the King of Israel.</span> "If" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;</span>) is omitted by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, D, L, etc., and many modern editors. Its omission is more concinnons to the other taunts, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "He saved others;" "He trusted in God." His claim to be Messiah would involve the Kingship of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-6.htm">Matthew 2:6</a>), which the title over his head asserted. <span class="cmt_word">We will believe him</span> (<span class="greek_word">pisteu/somen au)tw = ""</span>). We will believe (not subj., "let us believe") what he says. The Sinaitic, Vatican, and other good manuscripts read <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "on him." So Westcott and Hort, Tischendorf, etc. This form of expression would imply that they would put their trust in him, become his followers. A confident boast! for they were so fully persuaded of the final triumph of thcir malice, that they decreed they might safely make such a promise. And yet Christ did a greater thing than come down alive from the cross; he rose from the dead; but they believed not in him. And if the sign which they asked had been vouchsafed, they would have explained it away, or evaded its meaning, and nave been no nearer to salvation than now. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:35-44 It was usual to put shame upon malefactors, by a writing to notify the crime for which they suffered. So they set up one over Christ's head. This they designed for his reproach, but God so overruled it, that even his accusation was to his honour. There were crucified with him at the same time, two robbers. He was, at his death, numbered among the transgressors, that we, at our death, might be numbered among the saints. The taunts and jeers he received are here recorded. The enemies of Christ labour to make others believe that of religion and of the people of God, which they themselves know to be false. The chief priests and scribes, and the elders, upbraid Jesus with being the King of Israel. Many people could like the King of Israel well enough, if he would but come down from the cross; if they could but have his kingdom without the tribulation through which they must enter into it. But if no cross, then no Christ, no crown. Those that would reign with him, must be willing to suffer with him. Thus our Lord Jesus, having undertaken to satisfy the justice of God, did it, by submitting to the punishment of the worst of men. And in every minute particular recorded about the sufferings of Christ, we find some prediction in the Prophets or the Psalms fulfilled.</body></html>
