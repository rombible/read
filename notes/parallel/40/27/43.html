But (1) we must remember that they, ignoring the idea of a suffering Christ, would not look on the Psalm as Messianic at all, and (2) that their very familiarity with the words of the Psalm would naturally bring its phraseology to their lips when occasion called for it. Only they would persuade themselves that they were right in using it, while David's enemies were wrong.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He trusted in</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span>, <span class="accented">on</span>) <span class="cmt_word">God.</span> These scoffers cite a passage from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-8.htm">Psalm 22:8</a>, "He trusted unto the Lord that he would deliver him; let him deliver him, seeing he delighteth in him" (Hebrew); or, according to the Septuagint, "He hoped in the Lord; let him deliver him, let him save him, because he desires (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) him." <span class="cmt_word">Let him deliver him now, if he will have him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> is used in the Septuagint in the sense of "I love," "I wish for" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-14.htm">Deuteronomy 21:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17.htm">Psalm 17</a>:19; 40:11). But the Vulgate, by omitting the first <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, possibly takes the verb in the usual sense, <span class="accented">Liberet nunc, si vult, eum.</span> The Sinaitic and Vatican manuscripts and others support this reading, which is followed now by Tischendorf, and Westcott and Hort, so that the clause will run, <span class="accented">Let him now, if he will, deliver him.</span> But the Received Text and the Authorized Version are in closer agree ment with the original language of the psalm. <span class="cmt_word">For he said, I am the Son of God.</span> Insultingly they allude to his own assertions concerning his Divine nature, implying that, were he such as he pretended to be, he would not now be dying on the shameful cross. There are wonderful coincidences in thought and language between this passage and one in the Book of Wisdom (2:13-20), which speaks of the oppression of the righteous, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "He professeth to have the knowledge of God; and he calleth himself the child of the Lord.... Let us see if his words be true; and let us prove what shall happen in the end of him. For if the just man be the Son of God, he will help him, and deliver him from the hand of his enemies." The similarity of expression is to be attributed to the typical nature of the treatment of Christ, which the writer of Wisdom, with remarkable insight, thus forcibly delineated. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:35-44 It was usual to put shame upon malefactors, by a writing to notify the crime for which they suffered. So they set up one over Christ's head. This they designed for his reproach, but God so overruled it, that even his accusation was to his honour. There were crucified with him at the same time, two robbers. He was, at his death, numbered among the transgressors, that we, at our death, might be numbered among the saints. The taunts and jeers he received are here recorded. The enemies of Christ labour to make others believe that of religion and of the people of God, which they themselves know to be false. The chief priests and scribes, and the elders, upbraid Jesus with being the King of Israel. Many people could like the King of Israel well enough, if he would but come down from the cross; if they could but have his kingdom without the tribulation through which they must enter into it. But if no cross, then no Christ, no crown. Those that would reign with him, must be willing to suffer with him. Thus our Lord Jesus, having undertaken to satisfy the justice of God, did it, by submitting to the punishment of the worst of men. And in every minute particular recorded about the sufferings of Christ, we find some prediction in the Prophets or the Psalms fulfilled.</body></html>
