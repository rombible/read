The fact that the release of criminals was a common incident of a Latin <span class= "ital">lectisternium,</span> or feast in honour of the gods, makes the latter the more probable. If introduced by Pilate (and this is the only recorded instance of the practice) it was, we may believe, a concession intended to conciliate those whom his previous severities had alienated. Before this stage of the proceedings we have to place (1) the second conference between Pilate and the priests after his dialogue with our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/23-4.htm" title="Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.">Luke 23:4-5</a>), and their definite charge of sedition, now urged for the first time; and (2) his attempt, catching at the word "Galilee" as the scene of our Lord's work, to transfer the responsibility of judging to Herod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/23-6.htm" title="When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.">Luke 23:6-12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-26.</span> - <span class="accented">Barabbas preferred to Jesus.</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-6.htm">Mark 15:6-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-17.htm">Luke 23:17-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-39.htm">John 18:39, 40</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - Pilate now tries another expedient for delivering himself from the responsibility of condemning Jesus. <span class="cmt_word">At that feast</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">at a feast</span>, at feast time). Doubtless the Passover is meant, which was <span class="accented">the</span> feast especially of the Jews, and it is very improbable that the practice mentioned in the clause was allowed at any other of the feasts. <span class="cmt_word">The governor was wont to release unto the people</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span>, <span class="accented">the multitude</span>), etc. St. Luke says, "Of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast." The custom is not elsewhere mentioned. It was, however, most probably an institution established of old time in memory of the Exodus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-39.htm">John 18:39</a>), and continued by the Romans when they became masters of the country. A similar custom obtained at Rome and in Greece on certain great festivals. <span class="cmt_word">Whom they would.</span> The governor usually left the priests and people unfettered in their choice; on the present occasion he desired Jesus to be selected. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:11-25 Having no malice against Jesus, Pilate urged him to clear himself, and laboured to get him discharged. The message from his wife was a warning. God has many ways of giving checks to sinners, in their sinful pursuits, and it is a great mercy to have such checks from Providence, from faithful friends, and from our own consciences. O do not this abominable thing which the Lord hates! is what we may hear said to us, when we are entering into temptation, if we will but regard it. Being overruled by the priests, the people made choice of Barabbas. Multitudes who choose the world, rather than God, for their ruler and portion, thus choose their own delusions. The Jews were so bent upon the death of Christ, that Pilate thought it would be dangerous to refuse. And this struggle shows the power of conscience even on the worst men. Yet all was so ordered to make it evident that Christ suffered for no fault of his own, but for the sins of his people. How vain for Pilate to expect to free himself from the guilt of the innocent blood of a righteous person, whom he was by his office bound to protect! The Jews' curse upon themselves has been awfully answered in the sufferings of their nation. None could bear the sin of others, except Him that had no sin of his own to answer for. And are we not all concerned? Is not Barabbas preferred to Jesus, when sinners reject salvation that they may retain their darling sins, which rob God of his glory, and murder their souls? The blood of Christ is now upon us for good, through mercy, by the Jews' rejection of it. O let us flee to it for refuge!</body></html>
