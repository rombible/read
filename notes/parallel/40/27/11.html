We learn from him (1) that in his first conversation with the accusers, Pilate endeavoured to throw the <span class= "ital">onus</span> of judging upon them, and was met by the ostentatious disavowal of any power to execute judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/18-28.htm" title="Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas to the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.">John 18:28-32</a>); (2) that the single question which St. Matthew records was followed by a conversation in which our Lord declared that, though He was a King, it was not after the manner of the kingdoms of the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/18-33.htm" title="Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?">John 18:33-38</a>). The impression thus made on the mind of the Governor explains the desire which he felt to effect, in some way or other, the release of the accused.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-14.</span> - <span class="accented">Jesus examined by Pilate.</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-2.htm">Mark 15:2-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-2.htm">Luke 23:2-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-29.htm">John 18:29-38</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus stood before the governor.</span> St. Matthew omits here many details which the other evangelists, and especially St. John, supply. Pilate from the first had shown much reluctance to proceed, not being satisfied with the vague accusation that Jesus was a malefactor, and proposing that the Sanhedrists should try him according to Jewish Law, as if the question was merely a religious one. This treatment forced the priests to formulate a charge of which the roman authorities must take cognizance. They therefore stated unblushingly that Jesus had said that he was himself Christ a King (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-2.htm">Luke 23:2</a>). At this point St. Matthew's account steps in. <span class="cmt_word">Art thou</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the King of the Jews?</span> This examination took place within the Praetorium, where Christ was detained in the custody of some guards. The accusation of the Jews had been made outside, as they had scruples about entering the building. Jesus had never actually (so far as recorded) called himself King, though the appellation had been applied to him by Nathanael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-49.htm">John 1:49</a>), and the hosannahs of the multitudes had virtually so greeted him. His accusers had added the charge that he perverted the nation, and forbade to give tribute to Caesar. There is scorn and surprise, mingled with some awe, in Pilate's interrogation, "Thou - such a one as thou - art the King of the Jews?" <span class="cmt_word">Thou sayest.</span> What thou sayest is true. A strong affirmation. Christ accepts in its fullest sense that which the governor puts as a question (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-25.htm">Matthew 26:25, 64</a>). St. Paul alludes to this scene in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-13.htm">1 Timothy 6:13</a>, "Christ Jesus, who before Pilate witnessed the good confession." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:11-25 Having no malice against Jesus, Pilate urged him to clear himself, and laboured to get him discharged. The message from his wife was a warning. God has many ways of giving checks to sinners, in their sinful pursuits, and it is a great mercy to have such checks from Providence, from faithful friends, and from our own consciences. O do not this abominable thing which the Lord hates! is what we may hear said to us, when we are entering into temptation, if we will but regard it. Being overruled by the priests, the people made choice of Barabbas. Multitudes who choose the world, rather than God, for their ruler and portion, thus choose their own delusions. The Jews were so bent upon the death of Christ, that Pilate thought it would be dangerous to refuse. And this struggle shows the power of conscience even on the worst men. Yet all was so ordered to make it evident that Christ suffered for no fault of his own, but for the sins of his people. How vain for Pilate to expect to free himself from the guilt of the innocent blood of a righteous person, whom he was by his office bound to protect! The Jews' curse upon themselves has been awfully answered in the sufferings of their nation. None could bear the sin of others, except Him that had no sin of his own to answer for. And are we not all concerned? Is not Barabbas preferred to Jesus, when sinners reject salvation that they may retain their darling sins, which rob God of his glory, and murder their souls? The blood of Christ is now upon us for good, through mercy, by the Jews' rejection of it. O let us flee to it for refuge!</body></html>
