St. Mark and St. John call it purple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-17.htm" title="And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,">Mark 15:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-2.htm" title="And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,">John 19:2</a>); but the "purple "of the ancients was "crimson," and the same colour might easily be called by either name. It was probably some cast-off cloak of Pilate's own, or, possibly, that in which Herod had before arrayed Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-11.htm" title="And Herod with his men of war set him at nothing, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.">Luke 23:11</a>). Philo records a like mockery as practised upon an idiot at Alexandria, who was there made to represent Herod Agrippa II. (<span class= "ital">in Flacc.</span> p. 980). It was but too common a practice to subject condemned prisoners before execution to this kind of outrage. Here the point of the mockery lay, of course, in the fact that their Victim had been condemned as claiming the title of a King. They had probably seen or heard of the insults of like kind offered by Herod and his soldiers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-21.htm" title="But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.">Luke 23:21</a>), and now reproduced them with aggravated cruelty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They stripped him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>). Some manuscripts read <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, "when they had clothed him;" but this seems to have been derived from St. Mark, and to be here somewhat tautological. They had heard of his claim to be a King, so they determined to deride him with the mockery of royal honours. They tore his garments from his mangled form, thus opening afresh his half-dried wounds. <span class="cmt_word">Put on him a scarlet robe</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>). This was probably the short military woollen cloak worn by officers, in colour either scarlet or purple, and fastened by a buckle on the right shoulder. Some think it was a cast-off garment from the wardrobe of King Herod, which they found and appropriated to this purpose. Whatever it was, its bright hue was suitable for this mockery of regal splendour. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:26-30 Crucifixion was a death used only among the Romans; it was very terrible and miserable. A cross was laid on the ground, to which the hands and feet were nailed, it was then lifted up and fixed upright, so that the weight of the body hung on the nails, till the sufferer died in agony. Christ thus answered the type of the brazen serpent raised on a pole. Christ underwent all the misery and shame here related, that he might purchase for us everlasting life, and joy, and glory.</body></html>
