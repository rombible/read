Why, we ask, out of the whole crowd that was streaming to and fro, on the way to the place of execution, did the multitude seize on him? St. Mark's mention of him as the father of Alexander and Rufus (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-21.htm" title="And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.">Mark 15:21</a>), suggests the thought that his sons were afterwards prominent as members of the Christian community. May we not infer that he was suspected even then of being a secret disciple, and that this led the people to seize on him, and make him a sharer in the humiliation of his Master? He was coming, St. Mark adds, "out of the country."<p><span class= "bld">Him they compelled.</span>--The word is the technical term for forced service (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-41.htm" title="And whoever shall compel you to go a mile, go with him two.">Matthew 5:41</a>). The act implied that our Lord was sinking beneath the burden, and that the soldiers began to fear that He might die before they reached the place of execution.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As</span> <span class="cmt_word">they came out;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the city gate which led to the place of execution. <span class="cmt_word">They found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name.</span> He was, as the other synoptists mention, coming out of the country to Jerusalem, where probably he lived. Cyrene was a district in the north of Africa, under Roman rule, and colonized by a large number of Jews (Josephus, 'Cont. Apion.,' 2:4; 'Ant.,' 14:07. 2), who had a synagogue of their own at Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-9.htm">Acts 6:9</a>). Simon doubtless became a follower of Christ, and St. Mark mentions his two sons, Alexander and Rufus, as well known believers (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-13.htm">Romans 16:13</a>). Probably the guards saw in him some tokens of sympathy with Christ and compassion for his sufferings; or they used his services simply as being a foreigner, and not likely to resent being put to a task which a Hebrew would deem the lowest degradation. <span class="cmt_word">Him</span> <span class="cmt_word">they compelled</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">impressed</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>to bear his cross.</span> The verb translated "compelled" is derived from the Persian, and implies the compulsory power possessed by couriers of requisitioning horses and carriages in forwarding despatches (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-41.htm">Matthew 5:41</a>). The cross was probably the ordinary Latin cross, <span class="accented">crux immissa</span>, of which, however, the lower limb below the transom was longer than the upper; and this latter afforded a place where could be affixed the board containing the inscription. It was not as tall as usually represented; we are told that beasts of prey were able to gnaw the bodies hung thereon. In fact, the culprit's feet were only just raised above the ground, being drawn up till the soles lay flat on the upright beam. Nails were driven through the hands and feet, and the body was supported partly by these, and partly by a projecting pin of wood called the seat. The rest for the feet, often seen in pictures, was never used. A slight covering was allowed for decency's sake, the rest of the body being stripped of clothing; and thus the condemned, exposed to scorching sun, bleeding from the cruel scourge, suffering untold agonies, was left to die. Whether Jesus carried the whole cross or only the transom is uncertain. It is possible that the two were tied together by a rope at one end, so as to form an inverted V, and fastened in the proper position at the place of execution.
