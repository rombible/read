The former gives the better meaning. The "watch," or "guard," was a body of Roman soldiers (St. Matthew uses the Latin term <span class= "ital">custodia</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> who could not be set to such a task without Pilate's permission. If the priests had had such a "guard" at their disposal before, there would have been no need for them to apply to Pilate.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 65.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye have a watch</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">take a guard</span>). Pilate answers briefly and haughtily, "Well, I give permission; do as you like; take a body of soldiers as a guard, and <span class="cmt_word">go your way."</span> This last verb is imperative, so the former is most probably imperative also. If taken as indicative, the question arises - What guard had they? This is difficult to answer, unless, as Alford supposes, it may refer to some detachment placed at their disposal during the feast. But of this we know nothing historically. <span class="cmt_word">Make it as sure</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">secure it for yourselves</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>as ye can;</span> literally, <span class="accented">as ye know how.</span> Take any precaution you think fit to employ. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:62-66 On the Jewish sabbath, the chief priests and Pharisees, when they should have been at their devotions, were dealing with Pilate about securing the sepulchre. This was permitted that there might be certain proof of our Lord's resurrection. Pilate told them that they might secure the sepulchre as carefully as they could. They sealed the stone, and set a guard, and were satisfied that all needful care was taken. But to guard the sepulchre against the poor weak disciples was folly, because needless; while to think to guard it against the power of God, was folly, because fruitless, and to no purpose; yet they thought they dealt wisely. But the Lord took the wise in their own craftiness. Thus shall all the rage and the plans of Christ's enemies be made to promote his glory.</body></html>
