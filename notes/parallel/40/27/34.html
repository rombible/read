The animal secretion known as "gall" is clearly out of the question, and the meaning of the word is determined by its use in the Greek version of the Old Testament, where it stands for the "wormwood" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-4.htm" title="But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.">Proverbs 5:4</a>, for the poisonous herb joined with "wormwood" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-18.htm" title="Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood;">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>. It was clearly something at once nauseous and narcotic, given by the merciful to dull the pain of execution, and mixed with the sour wine of the country and with myrrh to make it drinkable. It may have been hemlock, or even poppy-juice, but there are no materials for deciding. It is probable that the offer came from the more pitiful of the women mentioned by St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-27.htm" title="And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.">Luke 23:27</a>) as following our Lord and lamenting. Such acts were among the received "works of mercy" of the time and place. The "tasting" implied a recognition of the kindly purpose of the act, but a recognition only. In the refusal to do more than taste we trace the resolute purpose to drink the cup which His Father had given Him to the last drop, and not to dull either the sense of suffering nor the clearness of His communion with His Father with the slumberous potion. The same draught was, we may believe, offered to the two criminals who were crucified with Him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 34-44.</span> - <span class="accented">The Crucifixion and the mockery.</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-23.htm">Mark 15:23-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-32.htm">Luke 23:32-43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-18.htm">John 19:18-24</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Vinegar...mingled with gall</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>). Instead of "vinegar" (<span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) very many manuscripts, followed by Tischendorf, Westcott and Hort, and others, read here, as in Mark, "wine" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="accented">Dederunt ei viaum bibere</span> (Vulgate). Doubtless the two words represent the same fluid, a wine of a sharp and acrid taste. The received reading in our text is supposed to be derived from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>, "They gave me gall for my meats, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink." "Gall" here signifies some bitter ingredient (St. Mark calls it "myrrh"), which was infused in the wine to impart a narcotic quality. It was the custom to offer this draught to criminals about to undergo crucifixion, either as an anodyne or to give them adventitious strength to bear their sufferings. The beverage is said to have been prepared by some benevolent ladies in Jerusalem, and to have been owed to a gloss on <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-6.htm">Proverbs 31:6, 7</a>, "Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto the bitter in soul; let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more." This was not an additional insult offered to Jesus, as some have opined, but a usual act of kindliness. <span class="cmt_word">When he had tasted</span> thereof, <span class="cmt_word">he</span> <span class="cmt_word">would not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>drink</span>. He accepted the kindly offer so far as to put his lips to the cup, but, recognizing its stupefying qualities, he refused to drink it. He willed to endure all the coming pains without mitigation; he would meet all with the powers of mind and body undarkened; he would have his senses and his self-consciousness unimpaired to the end. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:31-34 Christ was led as a Lamb to the slaughter, as a Sacrifice to the altar. Even the mercies of the wicked are really cruel. Taking the cross from him, they compelled one Simon to bear it. Make us ready, O Lord, to bear the cross thou hast appointed us, and daily to take it up with cheerfulness, following thee. Was ever sorrow like unto his sorrow? And when we behold what manner of death he died, let us in that behold with what manner of love he loved us. As if death, so painful a death, were not enough, they added to its bitterness and terror in several ways.</body></html>
