They had stood, it would seem, talking with Judas before the veil or curtain which screened it from the outer court, and he hurled or flung it into the Holy Place.<p><span class= "bld">Hanged himself.</span>--The word is the same as that used of Ahithophel, in the Greek version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-23.htm" title="And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and got him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulcher of his father.">2Samuel 17:23</a>, and is a perfectly accurate rendering. Some difficulties present themselves on comparing this brief record with <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-18.htm" title="Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out.">Acts 1:18</a>, which will be best examined in the Notes on that passage. Briefly, it may be said here that the horrors there recorded may have been caused by the self-murderer's want of skill, or the trembling agony that could not tie the noose firm enough.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He cast down the pieces of silver in the temple</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fb7;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1ff7;</span>, <span class="accented">in the sanctuary</span>, or, as good manuscripts read, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">into the sanctuary</span>). The priests were in the priests' court (which would be included in the term <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), separated by a stone partition from the court of the Gentiles. Into the latter area Judas had pressed; and, hurrying to the wall of division, he flung the cursed shekels with all his force into the inner place, as if to rescind the iniquitous contract and to cast away its pollution. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">departed.</span> He rushed away from the temple and the city into solitude, down into and across the valley of Hinnom, up the steep sides of the overhanging mountain - anywhere to escape human eyes, and, if it might be, to flee from himself. Vain endeavour! The memory of his useless crime haunts him; he has no hope in earth or heaven; life under this burden is no longer supportable. <span class="cmt_word">Went and hanged himself</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, <span class="accented">he strangled himself</span>; <span class="accented">laqueo se suspendit</span>, Vulgate). He mounted some precipitous rock, and unwinding the girdle (for it was unnecessary to find and take a rope with him) which he wore, and in which he had doubtless carried the pieces of silver, fastened it round his neck, and securing it to some tree or projecting stone, flung himself from the height. The horrible result is told by St. Peter in his first address to the disciples (Acts 1:48), "Falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out." This may have resulted from the breaking of the girdle. A fragment of Papias gives another explanation, recounting that he was crushed and disembowelled by a passing waggon. Thus Judas, the only man concerning whom the terrible expression is used, went "to his own place" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-25.htm">Acts 1:25</a>). he is the Ahithophel of the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-23.htm">2 Samuel 17:23</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-12.htm">Psalm 55:12-14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-10 Wicked men see little of the consequences of their crimes when they commit them, but they must answer for them all. In the fullest manner Judas acknowledged to the chief priests that he had sinned, and betrayed an innocent person. This was full testimony to the character of Christ; but the rulers were hardened. Casting down the money, Judas departed, and went and hanged himself, not being able to bear the terror of Divine wrath, and the anguish of despair. There is little doubt but that the death of Judas was before that of our blessed Lord. But was it nothing to them that they had thirsted after this blood, and hired Judas to betray it, and had condemned it to be shed unjustly? Thus do fools make a mock at sin. Thus many make light of Christ crucified. And it is a common instance of the deceitfulness of our hearts, to make light of our own sin by dwelling upon other people's sins. But the judgment of God is according to truth. Many apply this passage of the buying the piece of ground, with the money Judas brought back, to signify the favour intended by the blood of Christ to strangers, and sinners of the Gentiles. It fulfilled a prophecy, Zec 11:12. Judas went far toward repentance, yet it was not to salvation. He confessed, but not to God; he did not go to him, and say, I have sinned, Father, against heaven. Let none be satisfied with such partial convictions as a man may have, and yet remain full of pride, enmity, and rebellion.</body></html>
