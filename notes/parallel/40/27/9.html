(<span class= "ital">b</span>) May we fall back upon the Jewish notion that the spirit of Jeremiah had passed into Zechariah; or that Jeremiah, having, at one time, stood first in the Jewish order of the Prophets, was taken as representing the whole volume, as David was of the whole Book of Psalms? This is possible, but it hardly falls within the limits of Probability that the writer of the Gospel would deliberately have thus given his quotation in a form sure to cause perplexity. (c) May we believe that the writer quoted from memory, and that recollecting the two conspicuous chapters (18 and 19) in which Jeremiah had spoken of the potter and his work, he was led to think that this also belonged to the same group of prophecies? I am free to confess that the last hypothesis seems to me the most natural and free from difficulty, unless it be the difficulty which is created by an arbitrary hypothesis as to the necessity of literal accuracy in an inspired writing. (2) There is the fact that the words given by St. Matthew neither represent the Greek version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-13.htm" title="And the LORD said to me, Cast it to the potter: a goodly price that I was priced at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.">Zechariah 11:13</a>, nor the original Hebrew, but have the look of being a free quotation from memory adapted to the facts; and this, so far as it goes, is in favour of the last hypothesis. (3) It is hardly necessary to dwell on the fact that the words as they stand in Zechariah have an adequate historical meaning entirely independent of St. Matthew's application of them. This, as we have seen again and again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-23.htm" title="Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.">Matthew 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/2-15.htm" title="And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.">Matthew 2:15-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-15.htm" title="The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;">Matthew 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-17.htm" title="That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses.">Matthew 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-18.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit on him, and he shall show judgment to the Gentiles.">Matthew 12:18</a>), was entirely compatible with the Evangelist's manner of dealing with prophecy. It was enough for him that the old words fitted into the facts, without asking, as we ask, whether they were originally meant to point to them. The combination in one verse, as he remembered it, of the thirty pieces of silver and the potter's field, was a coincidence that he could not pass over.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Spoken by Jeremy the prophet.</span> The prophecy, which St. Matthew says was fulfilled by the use made of Judas's pieces of silver, is found, not in Jeremiah, as we now possess his text, but, with some variations, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12, 13</a>. It must be noted, however, that, though the passage in Zechariah has many remarkable affinities to the quotation in our evangelist's history, it is not. identical with it. In the prophet's vision there is no mention of the field, and the money is to be "cast to the potter in the house of the Lord." The Septuagint Version gives a very different reading, "Lay them in the foundry [or, 'furnace'], and I will see if it is approved, as I was approved for their sakes." And the last part of our quotation is hardly a representation of the Hebrew, "Cast it unto the potter, the goodly price that I was prised at of them." In the face of these discrepancies, it is supposed by many that St. Matthew had in his mind some utterance of Jeremiah not now extant; but if, as most expositors affirm, he was citing, more or less accurately, the words of Zechariah, we have to account for their being attributed to a wrong author. Of this difficulty, as it is considered, many solutions are offered. For instance: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The evangelist added no name to "the prophet;" and a scribe, hazily remembering the transaction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-6.htm">Jeremiah 32:6</a>, etc., interpolated the word "Jeremiah." It is true that the Syriac omits "Jeremiah," but all other versions, and nearly all the Greek manuscripts, insert it; so there can be no reasonable doubt that it existed in the original text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The two words written abbreviated thus, <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x399;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, might be easily mistaken. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The evangelist fell into error, by oversight or lapse of memory, as is supposed to be the ease in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-26.htm">Mark 2:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-4.htm">Acts 7:4, 16</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The last chapters of Zechariah were really the composition of Jeremiah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> Jeremiah, being set at the head of the prophets in the Hebrew Scriptures, gave his name to all the writings following, which were cited indiscriminately as the utterances of Jeremiah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> St. Matthew has made (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>, and so <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-2.htm">Mark 1:2, 3</a>) a cento of passages derived from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-2.htm">Jeremiah 18:2</a>, etc.; Jeremiah 19:1, 2; 32:8-14, combined with the prediction in Zechariah, and attributed the passage thus formed to the most celebrated prophet. Plainly the evangelist has not confined himself to the actual words of his author or authors, but has written a Targum thereon, being divinely guided to see in the present transaction a fulfilment of an obscure announcement and prefiguration in olden days There are many other solutions proposed, with which we need not concern ourselves; the one last stated is reasonable, and may be adopted safely by those simple Christians who believe that the writers of the Bible were supernaturally preserved from errors, not only in doctrine and precept and fact, but also in chronology, grammar, geography, citation, etc. The whole difficulty is of little importance, and too much has been made of what, alter all, may be simply an <span class="accented">erratum</span> perpetuated from an ancient copy. <span class="cmt_word">They took</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which might mean, "I took," as in Zechariah). In the prophecy it is the despised Shepherd who casts the money to the potter; but "gave" in the next clause is plural. <span class="cmt_word">The price of him that was valued</span> (<span class="accented">priced</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>whom they of the children of Israel did value</span> (<span class="accented">price</span>) (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;</span>). The Authorized Version supplies <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;</span> before <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;</span>. The Revised Version supplies <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, "whom certain of the children of Israel did price." The words are ironical, answering to the prophet's expression, "the goodly price that I was prised at of them"! The preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> may be rendered "on the part of;" so the evangelist means that the priests offered this mean price for the Shepherd at the instigation of, at the instance of, the children of Israel, who thus shared in and authorized the iniquitous transaction. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-10 Wicked men see little of the consequences of their crimes when they commit them, but they must answer for them all. In the fullest manner Judas acknowledged to the chief priests that he had sinned, and betrayed an innocent person. This was full testimony to the character of Christ; but the rulers were hardened. Casting down the money, Judas departed, and went and hanged himself, not being able to bear the terror of Divine wrath, and the anguish of despair. There is little doubt but that the death of Judas was before that of our blessed Lord. But was it nothing to them that they had thirsted after this blood, and hired Judas to betray it, and had condemned it to be shed unjustly? Thus do fools make a mock at sin. Thus many make light of Christ crucified. And it is a common instance of the deceitfulness of our hearts, to make light of our own sin by dwelling upon other people's sins. But the judgment of God is according to truth. Many apply this passage of the buying the piece of ground, with the money Judas brought back, to signify the favour intended by the blood of Christ to strangers, and sinners of the Gentiles. It fulfilled a prophecy, Zec 11:12. Judas went far toward repentance, yet it was not to salvation. He confessed, but not to God; he did not go to him, and say, I have sinned, Father, against heaven. Let none be satisfied with such partial convictions as a man may have, and yet remain full of pride, enmity, and rebellion.</body></html>
