The illustration seems to have been a familiar one among the Jews, and a proverb all but verbally identical is found as a saying of Rabbi Tarphon. Like illustrations have been found in the proverbs and satires of every country, all teaching that men are keen-sighted as to the faults of others, blind as to their own. The Gracchi complain of sedition, and Clodius accuses others of adultery. We all need the wish--<p>"Oh, wad some Power the giftie gie us,<p>To see oursels as others see us!"<p><span class= "bld">But considerest.</span>--There is the same contrast as between "seeing" and "considering" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-26.htm" title="Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they?">Matthew 6:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-28.htm" title="And why take you thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:">Matthew 6:28</a>. Our own faults require the careful scrutiny which we never give them: the faults of others we should be content to glance at.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-5.</span> - The heinousness of censoriousness as a hindrance to one's self and to one's work for others. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - Parallel passage:<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-41.htm">Luke 6:41</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And why</span> - when it is so contrary to common sense - <span class="cmt_word">beholdest thou the mote,</span> etc.? A Jewish proverbial saying, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Talm. Bab., 'Bab. Bathra,' 15b, Rabbi Jochanan ( <span class="date">third century A.D.</span>),expounding <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-1.htm">Ruth 1:1</a>, says, "A generation which when under judgment (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5e0;&#x5e9;&#x5e4;&#x5d8;</span>) judgeth its judges. When one saith to a man, Cast out the mote out of thine eyes, he saith (in answer), Cast out the beam out of thine eyes." In Talm. Bab., 'Erach.,' 16<span class="accented">b</span>, "Out of thy teeth" seems to be the right reading. In these verses the "eye" is usually taken as belonging solely to the illustration, and as not itself representing any one object. It may be so, but it has been used so recently (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22</a>) of the spiritual sense that it is more natural to take it so here. In this case the thought of the passage is of faults existing in a man's spiritual sense hindering his spiritual vision. The censorious man sees any fault, however small, readily enough in others, but does not see the much greater fault which he himself as a matter of fact has - his own censoriousness. This censoriousness is not a slight, but a great hindrance to his own spiritual vision, much more to his being of use in removing hindrances from the eye of another. <span class="accented">The mote</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; Latt. <span class="accented">festucam</span>; any small vegetable body. The English word is from the Anglo-Saxon <span class="accented">mot</span>, "a small particle" (cf. further <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-41.htm">Luke 6:41</a>, note). Observe that our Lord allows that there is something wrong with the brother's spiritual vision, just as he allows that the unmerciful servant had a real debt owing to him. <span class="cmt_word">That is in thy brother's eye</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>, note). Our Lord is here speaking of the relation of believers to fellow-believers. He tacitly contrasts the censoriousness of the Pharisees towards fellow-Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-49.htm">John 7:49</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But considerest not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). With any attention of mind; contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-19.htm">Romans 4:19</a> (Abraham gave earnest consideration to his own age, and yet believed). <span class="cmt_word">The beam</span>. So huge a piece of wood is there in thine own eye. <span class="cmt_word">That is in thine own eye</span>. The order of the Greek lays still more emphasis on the fact that, though in thy very own eye there is a beam, thou payest no regard to that (cf. ver. 5, note). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-6 We must judge ourselves, and judge of our own acts, but not make our word a law to everybody. We must not judge rashly, nor pass judgment upon our brother without any ground. We must not make the worst of people. Here is a just reproof to those who quarrel with their brethren for small faults, while they allow themselves in greater ones. Some sins are as motes, while others are as beams; some as a gnat, others as a camel. Not that there is any sin little; if it be a mote, or splinter, it is in the eye; if a gnat, it is in the throat; both are painful and dangerous, and we cannot be easy or well till they are got out. That which charity teaches us to call but a splinter in our brother's eye, true repentance and godly sorrow will teach us to call a beam in our own. It is as strange that a man can be in a sinful, miserable condition, and not be aware of it, as that a man should have a beam in his eye, and not consider it; but the god of this world blinds their minds. Here is a good rule for reprovers; first reform thyself.</body></html>
