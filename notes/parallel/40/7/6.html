To give that holy flesh to dogs would have seemed to the devout Israelite the greatest of all profanations. Our Lord teaches us that there is a like risk of desecration in dealing with the yet holier treasure of divine truth. Another aspect of the same warning is brought out in the second clause. The fashion of the time had made pearls the costliest of all jewels, as in the parable of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-45.htm" title="Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:">Matthew 13:45</a> (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-9.htm" title="In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with modesty and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;">1Timothy 2:9</a>), and so they too became symbols of the preciousness of truth. The "dogs" and the "swine," in their turn, represent distinct forms of evil, the former being here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-2.htm" title="Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.">Philippians 3:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-15.htm" title="For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and fornicators, and murderers, and idolaters, and whoever loves and makes a lie.">Revelation 22:15</a>, the type of impurity, the latter (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-13.htm" title="The boar out of the wood does waste it, and the wild beast of the field does devour it.">Psalm 80:13</a>) of ferocity. The second comparison may possibly imply, as in a condensed fable, the disappointment and consequent rage of the swine at finding that what they took for grain was only pearls. We are to beware lest we so present the truth, either in direct teaching or by an undiscerning disclosure of the deeper religious emotions of the soul, to men, that we make them worse and not better than before.<p>We are met by the questions, Are we, then, to class our fellow-men under these heads, and to think of them as dogs and swine? Is not this to forget the previous teaching, and to judge with the harshest judgment? The answer to these questions must be found, we may believe, in thinking of the dogs and swine as representing not men and women as such, but the passions of this kind or that which make them brutish. So long as they identify themselves with those passions, we must deal cautiously and wisely with them. St. Paul did not preach the gospel to the howling mob at Ephesus, or to the "lewd fellows of the baser sort" at Thessalonica, and yet at another time he would have told any member of those crowds that he too had been redeemed, and might claim an inheritance among those who had been sanctified. We need, it might be added, to be on our guard against the brute element in ourselves not less than in others. There, too, we may desecrate the holiest truths by dealing with them in the spirit of irreverence, or passion, or may cynically jest with our own truest and noblest impulses.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - Matthew only. <span class="cmt_word">Give not that</span> <span class="cmt_word">which is holy,</span> etc. While you are not to be censorious towards brethren (vers. 1-5), you must recognize the great and fundamental differences that there are between men. You must not treat those who are mere dogs and swine as if they were able to appreciate either the holiness or the beauty and wealth of spiritual truth. <span class="accented">Give</span> Observe that "give," "cast," are naturally used of feeding dogs and swine respectively. <span class="accented">That which is holy</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). The metaphor is taken from the law that the things offered in sacrifice were no longer to be treated as common food (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-1.htm">Leviticus 22:1-16</a>, especially ver. 14, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Unto the dogs</span>. The scavengers of Eastern cities, which by nature and habit love and greedily devour the most unholy of things (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-31.htm">Exodus 22:31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Neither</span> <span class="cmt_word">cast ye your pearls,</span> <span class="accented">Pearls.</span> Only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-45.htm">Matthew 13:45, 46</a> in the Gospels. In form not so very unlike swine's food of beans or nuts, they here represent the beauty and precious wealth of the various parts of the Gospel, in which Christ's disciples are accustomed to delight (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). Ignatius ('Ephesians,' &sect; 11) calls his bonds his "spiritual pearls." <span class="cmt_word">Before swine</span>; <span class="accented">before the swine</span> (Revised Version). Probably in both cases the article is used with the object of bringing the particular dogs and swine to whom these are given more vividly before us. <span class="accented">Swine.</span> Which have no care for such things, but rather wallow in filth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-22.htm">2 Peter 2:22</a>). <span class="accented">Dogs... swine.</span> The terms seem to so far indicate different classes of men, or more truly different characters in men, as that the one term points to the greedy participation of the wicked in open profanation, the ether to the sottish indifference of sinners to that which is most attractive. <span class="cmt_word">Lest</span> <span class="cmt_word">they;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the swine. Dogs, even though wild in the East, would not "tread down" the food. <span class="cmt_word">Trample them under their feet</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>). In ignorance of their real worth and in disappointment that they do not afford them satisfaction (For the future, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-25.htm">Matthew 5:25</a>, note.) It here expresses the greater certainty of the trampling than of the rending (aorist subjective). <span class="cmt_word">And turn again</span> - Revised Version omits "again" <span class="cmt_word">- and rend you</span>. In rage at the disappointment experienced. The clause expresses the personal enmity which those who wilfully reject the gospel often feel towards those that have offered it to them. It might be thought difficult to carry out this command, as it is evident that we cannot know beforehand who will accept the gospel or not. But in cases where the character of the person is not known (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> as when St. Paul preached at Athens, etc.), the command does not apply. Our Lord <span class="accented">supposes</span> the case where the character is apparent (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-24.htm">1 Timothy 5:24</a>). Theodoret (<span class="accented">vide</span> Resch, 'Agrapha,' pp. 103, 168), in quoting this verse, adds, "My mysteries are tot me and mine," which, clearly an adaptation of Symmachus and Theodotion's rendering of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d6;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;</span> (cf. also Targ. Jon.), seems to have become almost an authorized, and certainly a true, interpretation of our verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-6 We must judge ourselves, and judge of our own acts, but not make our word a law to everybody. We must not judge rashly, nor pass judgment upon our brother without any ground. We must not make the worst of people. Here is a just reproof to those who quarrel with their brethren for small faults, while they allow themselves in greater ones. Some sins are as motes, while others are as beams; some as a gnat, others as a camel. Not that there is any sin little; if it be a mote, or splinter, it is in the eye; if a gnat, it is in the throat; both are painful and dangerous, and we cannot be easy or well till they are got out. That which charity teaches us to call but a splinter in our brother's eye, true repentance and godly sorrow will teach us to call a beam in our own. It is as strange that a man can be in a sinful, miserable condition, and not be aware of it, as that a man should have a beam in his eye, and not consider it; but the god of this world blinds their minds. Here is a good rule for reprovers; first reform thyself.</body></html>
