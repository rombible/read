The confession there recognised is more than lip-homage, and implies the loyal service of obedience. And the condemnation is pronounced not on those who have wandered from the truth, but on those who have been "workers of iniquity," or, as the word more strictly means, "of lawlessness." The words remind us of those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/15-2.htm" title="He that walks uprightly, and works righteousness, and speaks the truth in his heart.">Psalm 15:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/24-3.htm" title="Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place?">Psalm 24:3-4</a>, and are, perhaps, a transfer of what David had spoken of his ideal of his earthly kingdom to that of the kingdom of heaven which the Christ had come to found.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-27.htm">Luke 13:27</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">And then will I profess unto them</span>. Openly in the face of all men (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I never knew you</span>. Even when you did all these miracles. etc., I had not that personal knowledge of you which is only the result of heart-sympathy. There was never anything in common between you and me. Although this is, perhaps, the only example of this sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> in the synoptic Gospels, it is common in John. <span class="cmt_word">Depart from me</span>. The absence of recognition by Christ, though not represented as the cause, yet will involve departure from his presence (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:9</a>). This clause reproduces verbally the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-8.htm">Psalm 6:8</a>, except in St. Matthew's word used for "depart" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>), which gives more idea of distance in the removal than the word used in the psalm and in Luke (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye that work</span>.

Iniquity. The assurance of the psalmist becomes the verdict of the Judge. Observe that at this, the end of his discourse, our Lord speaks not of sin generally (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), but of lawlessness (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). He has throughout been insisting upon obedience to the Law in its final meaning as essentially necessary for his followers (most recently ver. 12). So that instead of saying, "ye that work sin," he uses the correlative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-4.htm">1 John 3:4</a>), for sin is neglect of or opposition to the perfect Law of God in the three spheres that this regards - self, the world, God (cf. Bishop Westcott, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-4.htm">1 John 3:4</a>). It is, perhaps, more than a coincidence that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a> we have again the collocation of the Lord knowing and of man's <span class="accented">departing</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either from him or from sin (cf. especially the parallel <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-27.htm">Luke 13:27</a>); <span class="accented">vide</span> Resch, 'Agrapha,' p. 207. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:21-29 Christ here shows that it will not be enough to own him for our Master, only in word and tongue. It is necessary to our happiness that we believe in Christ, that we repent of sin, that we live a holy life, that we love one another. This is his will, even our sanctification. Let us take heed of resting in outward privileges and doings, lest we deceive ourselves, and perish eternally, as multitudes do, with a lie in our right hand. Let every one that names the name of Christ, depart from all sin. There are others, whose religion rests in bare hearing, and it goes no further; their heads are filled with empty notions. These two sorts of hearers are represented as two builders. This parable teaches us to hear and do the sayings of the Lord Jesus: some may seem hard to flesh and blood, but they must be done. Christ is laid for a foundation, and every thing besides Christ is sand. Some build their hopes upon worldly prosperity; others upon an outward profession of religion. Upon these they venture; but they are all sand, too weak to bear such a fabric as our hopes of heaven. There is a storm coming that will try every man's work. When God takes away the soul, where is the hope of the hypocrite? The house fell in the storm, when the builder had most need of it, and expected it would be a shelter to him. It fell when it was too late to build another. May the Lord make us wise builders for eternity. Then nothing shall separate us from the love of Christ Jesus. The multitudes were astonished at the wisdom and power of Christ's doctrine. And this sermon, ever so often read over, is always new. Every word proves its Author to be Divine. Let us be more and more decided and earnest, making some one or other of these blessednesses and Christian graces the main subject of our thoughts, even for weeks together. Let us not rest in general and confused desires after them, whereby we grasp at all, but catch nothing.</body></html>
