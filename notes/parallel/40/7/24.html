On the assumption that the Sermon on the Plain was different from that on the Mount, the recurrence of the same image there makes it probable that this or some similar parable was not an uncommon close to our Lord's discourses.<p><span class= "bld">I will liken him unto a wise man.</span>--The surrounding scenery may, in this as in other instances, have suggested the illustration. As in all hilly countries, the streams of Galilee rush down the torrent-beds during the winter and early spring, sweep all before them, overflow their banks, and leave beds of alluvial deposit on either side. When summer comes their waters fail (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-18.htm" title="Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuses to be healed? will you be altogether to me as a liar, and as waters that fail?">Jeremiah 15:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-15.htm" title="My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;">Job 6:15</a>), and what had seemed a goodly river is then a tract covered with debris of stones and sand. A stranger coming to build might be attracted by the ready-prepared level surface of the sand. It would be easier to build there instead of working upon the hard and rugged rock. But the people of the land would know and mock the folly of such a builder, and he would pass (our Lord's words may possibly refer to something that had actually occurred) into a by-word of reproach. On such a house the winter torrent had swept down in its fury, and the storms had raged, and then the fair fabric, on which time and money had been expended, had given way, and fallen into a heap of ruins. Interpreting the parable in the connection in which our Lord has placed it, it is clear that the house is the general fabric of an outwardly religious life. "The rock" can be nothing else than the firm foundation of repentance and obedience, the assent of the will and affections as well as of the lips. The "sand" answers to the shifting, uncertain feelings which are with some men (the "foolish" ones of the parable) the only ground on which they act--love of praise, respect for custom, and the like. The "wind," the "rain," the "floods" hardly admit, unless by an unreal minuteness, of individual interpretation, but represent collectively the violence of persecution, of suffering, of temptations from without, beneath which all but the life which rests on the true foundation necessarily gives way.<p>Such is obviously the primary meaning of the parable here, but, like most other parables, it has other meanings, which, though secondary, are yet suggestive and instructive, and are not unsanctioned by the analogy of our Lord's teaching. (1.) Already He had bestowed upon one of His disciples the name of Cephas, Peter, the Rock, and in so doing had at least indicated the type of character represented by the "rock" upon which the wise man built. When He afterwards said, "Upon this rock will I build my Church," He was speaking in the character of a wise Master-builder who saw in fervent faith and unhesitating obedience the ground-work on which the Christian society, which He designated as His kingdom, was to rest. (2.) Personal experience and the teaching of the Spirit led men to the thought that there must be a yet deeper foundation, a rock below the rock even of obedience and holiness; and they found in Christ Himself that Rock and that Foundation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/3-10.htm" title="According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds thereon. But let every man take heed how he builds thereupon.">1Corinthians 3:10-11</a>). Only in personal union with Him could they find the stability of will without which even their firmest purposes would be as the shifting sand.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-27.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-47.htm">Luke 6:47-49</a> (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10-16</a>). A solemn close to the sermon. By the similitude of two builders our Lord warns his followers that to have heard his words will have been useless unless they put them into practice. Observe that although the word "<span class="accented">hear</span> in these verses cannot indicate that full "<span class="accented">hearing"</span> which it sometimes connotes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-14.htm">Matthew 10:14</a>), yet it seems to mean more than merely listening, and to imply both a grasp of what is intended by the statements made and at least some acquiescence in their truth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-3.htm">Revelation 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>). According to the above explanation, it will be seen that in the imagery the rock represents practice; the sand, mere sentiment. There is thus a partial correspondence with the works insisted on by St. James in contrast to a bare orthodox faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-24.htm">James 2:24</a>). Assent is insufficient; there must be action. Not uncommonly, indeed, the rock is considered to refer to the Lord himself, and the sand to human effort. Cf. Ford: "The parallel passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-48.htm">Luke 6:48</a>), where the words, 'cometh unto Me,' are inserted, indicates clearly the foundation of <span class="accented">faith</span>, the receiving the Lord Jesus as our Prophet, Priest, and King, which is the only basis on which <span class="accented">good</span> works can be built" (cf. even Allord). This, however, is hardly exegesis, but application, for the "coming to Christ" is in Luke only introductory to the hearing and doing, and is altogether omitted here. Although the statement is true in itself, it is only so far proper to this passage in that, apart from practice, there is (ver. 23) no heart-union with Christ. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - Therefore whosoever hoareth; Revised Version, <span class="accented">every one therefore which heareth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> , <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32</a>). The relative used lays <span class="accented">stress</span> on the quality implied in the verb: every one who is of the kind that <span class="accented">hears</span> (contrast ver. 26). <span class="cmt_word">These sayings</span> (Revised Version, <span class="accented">words</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>mine, and doeth them</span>.

Not shall, in fact, be made like, ch. 6:8 (Weiss), but shall be likened in figure and parable. <span class="cmt_word">Unto a wise man</span>. Prudent, sensible (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Which built his house upon a rock</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">the rock.</span> Which in not a few <span class="accented">cases</span> may be found at no great distance from the surface. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:21-29 Christ here shows that it will not be enough to own him for our Master, only in word and tongue. It is necessary to our happiness that we believe in Christ, that we repent of sin, that we live a holy life, that we love one another. This is his will, even our sanctification. Let us take heed of resting in outward privileges and doings, lest we deceive ourselves, and perish eternally, as multitudes do, with a lie in our right hand. Let every one that names the name of Christ, depart from all sin. There are others, whose religion rests in bare hearing, and it goes no further; their heads are filled with empty notions. These two sorts of hearers are represented as two builders. This parable teaches us to hear and do the sayings of the Lord Jesus: some may seem hard to flesh and blood, but they must be done. Christ is laid for a foundation, and every thing besides Christ is sand. Some build their hopes upon worldly prosperity; others upon an outward profession of religion. Upon these they venture; but they are all sand, too weak to bear such a fabric as our hopes of heaven. There is a storm coming that will try every man's work. When God takes away the soul, where is the hope of the hypocrite? The house fell in the storm, when the builder had most need of it, and expected it would be a shelter to him. It fell when it was too late to build another. May the Lord make us wise builders for eternity. Then nothing shall separate us from the love of Christ Jesus. The multitudes were astonished at the wisdom and power of Christ's doctrine. And this sermon, ever so often read over, is always new. Every word proves its Author to be Divine. Let us be more and more decided and earnest, making some one or other of these blessednesses and Christian graces the main subject of our thoughts, even for weeks together. Let us not rest in general and confused desires after them, whereby we grasp at all, but catch nothing.</body></html>
