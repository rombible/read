The unjust judgment of man does not bring upon us a divine judgment which is also unjust; but the severity which we have unjustly meted out to others, becomes, by a retributive law, the measure of that which is justly dealt out to us.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - Parallels to the second clause in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-24.htm">Mark 4:24</a>, <span class="cmt_word">For</span>. Explanatory of" that ye be not judged." The principle of your own judgment will be applied in turn to yourselves. <span class="cmt_word">With what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</span> The judgment (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) is the verdict; the measure is the severity or otherwise of the verdict. In both clauses (cf. ver. 1, note) the passives refer to judgment by God, as is even more clear in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-24.htm">Mark 4:24</a>. The saying, "with what measure," etc., is found in Mishua, 'Sotah,' 1:7 ("With the measure with which a man measures do they measure to him"), where it is applied to the <span class="accented">jus talionis</span> in the case of a woman suspected of adultery (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-11.htm">Numbers 5:11-31</a>). <span class="accented">Again.</span> Omitted by the Revised Version, with the manuscripts. It was naturally inserted by the copyists, either as an unconscious deduction or from the parallel passage in Luke; but it is absent in the characteristically Jewish form of the saying found in the Mishna. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-6 We must judge ourselves, and judge of our own acts, but not make our word a law to everybody. We must not judge rashly, nor pass judgment upon our brother without any ground. We must not make the worst of people. Here is a just reproof to those who quarrel with their brethren for small faults, while they allow themselves in greater ones. Some sins are as motes, while others are as beams; some as a gnat, others as a camel. Not that there is any sin little; if it be a mote, or splinter, it is in the eye; if a gnat, it is in the throat; both are painful and dangerous, and we cannot be easy or well till they are got out. That which charity teaches us to call but a splinter in our brother's eye, true repentance and godly sorrow will teach us to call a beam in our own. It is as strange that a man can be in a sinful, miserable condition, and not be aware of it, as that a man should have a beam in his eye, and not consider it; but the god of this world blinds their minds. Here is a good rule for reprovers; first reform thyself.</body></html>
