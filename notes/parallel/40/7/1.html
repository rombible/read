Whether this be the result of omission or of insertion, thus much at least seems clear, that while Matthew 5 is mainly a protest against the teaching of the scribes, and Matthew 6 mainly a protest against their corruption of the three great elements of the religious life--almsgiving, prayer, and fasting--and the worldliness out of which that corruption grew, this deals chiefly with the temptations incident to the more advanced stages of that life when lower forms of evil have been overcome--with the temper that judges others, the self-deceit of unconscious hypocrisy, the danger of unreality.<p><span class= "bld">Judge not, that ye be not judged.</span>--The words point to a tendency inherent in human nature, and are therefore universally applicable; but they had, we must remember, a special bearing on the Jews. They, as really in the van of the religious progress of mankind, took on themselves to judge other nations. All true teachers of Israel, even though they represented different aspects of the truth, felt the danger, and warned their countrymen against it. St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-3.htm" title="And think you this, O man, that judge them which do such things, and do the same, that you shall escape the judgment of God?">Romans 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-5.htm" title="Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.">1Corinthians 4:5</a>) and St. James (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-11.htm" title="Speak not evil one of another, brothers. He that speaks evil of his brother, and judges his brother, speaks evil of the law, and judges the law: but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.">James 4:11</a>) alike, in this matter, echo the teaching of their Master. And the temptation still continues. In proportion as any nation, any church, any society, any individual man rises above the common forms of evil that surround them, they are disposed to sit in judgment on those who are still in the evil.<p>The question, how far we can obey the precept, is not without its difficulties. Must we not, even as a matter of duty, be judging others every day of our lives? The juryman giving his verdict, the master who discharges a dishonest servant, the bishop who puts in force the discipline of the Church--are these acting against our Lord's commands? And if not, where are we to draw the line? The answer to these questions is not found in the distinctions of a formal casuistry. We have rather to remember that our Lord here, as elsewhere, gives principles rather than rules, and embodies the principle in a rule which, because it cannot be kept in the letter, forces us back upon the spirit. What is forbidden is the censorious judging temper, eager to find faults and condemn men for them, suspicious of motives, detecting, let us say, for example, in controversy, and denouncing, the faintest shade of heresy. No mere rules can guide us as to the limits of our judgments. What we need is to have "our senses exercised to discern between good and evil," to cultivate the sensitiveness of conscience and the clearness of self-knowledge. Briefly, we may say:--(1.) Judge no man unless it be a duty to do so. (2.) As far as may be, judge the offence, and not the offender. (3.) Confine your judgment to the earthly side of faults, and leave their relation to God, to Him who sees the heart. (4.) Never judge at all without remembering your own sinfulness, and the ignorance and infirmities which may extenuate the sinfulness of others.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-12.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> As anxiety about the things of this life hinders us Godwards (ch. 6:19-34), so does censoriousness manwards (vers. 1-12), our Lord thus tacitly opposing two typically Jewish faults. Censoriousness - the personal danger of having it (vers. 1, 2), its seriousness as a sign of ignorance and as a hindrance to spiritual vision (vers. 3-5), even though there must be a recognition of great moral differences (ver. 6). Grace to overcome it and to exercise judgment rightly can be obtained by prayer (vers. 7-11), the secret of overcoming being found in treating others as one would like to be treated one's self (ver. 12). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-37.htm">Luke 6:37</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Judge not</span>. Not merely "do not condemn," for this would leave too much latitude; nor, on the other hand, "do not ever judge," for this is sometimes our duty; but "do not be always judging" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). Our Lord opposes the censorious spirit. "Let us therefore be lowly minded, brethren, laying aside all arrogance, and conceit, and folly, and anger, and let us do that which is written... most of all remembering the words of the Lord Jesus which he spake, teaching forbearance and brag-suffering; for thus he spake... 'As ye judge, so shall ye be judged,'" Clem. Romans, &sect; 13 (where see Bishop Lightfoot's note; el. also Resch, 'Agrapha,' pp. 96, 136 ft.); cf. 'Ab.,' 1:7 (Taylor), "Judge every man in the scale of merit;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> let the scale incline towards the side of merit or acquittal. <span class="cmt_word">That ye be not judged</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by God, with special reference to the last day (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-12.htm">James 2:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-9.htm">James 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-3.htm">Romans 2:3</a>). Hardly of judgment by men, as Barrow (serm. 20.): "Men take it for allowable to retaliate in this way to the height, and stoutly to load the censorious man with censure." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-6 We must judge ourselves, and judge of our own acts, but not make our word a law to everybody. We must not judge rashly, nor pass judgment upon our brother without any ground. We must not make the worst of people. Here is a just reproof to those who quarrel with their brethren for small faults, while they allow themselves in greater ones. Some sins are as motes, while others are as beams; some as a gnat, others as a camel. Not that there is any sin little; if it be a mote, or splinter, it is in the eye; if a gnat, it is in the throat; both are painful and dangerous, and we cannot be easy or well till they are got out. That which charity teaches us to call but a splinter in our brother's eye, true repentance and godly sorrow will teach us to call a beam in our own. It is as strange that a man can be in a sinful, miserable condition, and not be aware of it, as that a man should have a beam in his eye, and not consider it; but the god of this world blinds their minds. Here is a good rule for reprovers; first reform thyself.</body></html>
