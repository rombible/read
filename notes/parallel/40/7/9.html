Our Lord appeals to the experience and natural feelings of his hearers themselves to emphasize the readiness of the Father - "your Father," whose nature you share, and from whom you derive your feelings of fatherhood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-15.htm">Ephesians 3:15</a>) - to grant the prayers of his children.

A blessed encouragement, for he will thus answer the underlying desire, though not necessarily the verbal expression of the prayer. So when Monica prayed that her son might not sail to Rome, God did not grant this, but gave her "the <span class="accented">hinge</span> of her desire," for it was <span class="accented">Augustine's</span> journey to Italy that was the means of his conversion (Aug., 'Conf.,' 5:15). <span class="cmt_word">Bread... fish.</span> The most usual food on the Lake of Galilee (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-17.htm">Matthew 14:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-9.htm">John 6:9</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-3.htm">Matthew 4:3</a>, note). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:7-11 Prayer is the appointed means for obtaining what we need. Pray; pray often; make a business of prayer, and be serious and earnest in it. Ask, as a beggar asks alms. Ask, as a traveller asks the way. Seek, as for a thing of value that we have lost; or as the merchantman that seeks goodly pearls. Knock, as he that desires to enter into the house knocks at the door. Sin has shut and barred the door against us; by prayer we knock. Whatever you pray for, according to the promise, shall be given you, if God see it fit for you, and what would you have more? This is made to apply to all that pray aright; every one that asketh receiveth, whether Jew or Gentile, young or old, rich or poor, high or low, master or servant, learned or unlearned, all are alike welcome to the throne of grace, if they come in faith. It is explained by a comparison taken from earthly parents, and their readiness to give their children what they ask. Parents are often foolishly fond, but God is all-wise; he knows what we need, what we desire, and what is fit for us. Let us never suppose our heavenly Father would bid us pray, and then refuse to hear, or give us what would be hurtful.</body></html>
