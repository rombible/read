Those who attach most importance to the ethical side of religion, see in them the practical outcome of doctrine in life, character, and deeds. Others, who live in a constant dread of heresy, dwell on doctrines rather than acts as the "fruits" by which we are to discern the false teachers and the true. Good works, they say, may be but the sheep's clothing that hides the heretic wolf. The analogy of Scriptural language, and even of that of most theologians, the familiar phrases which speak of good works as the fruits of faith and the like, are, it is believed, entirely in favour of the former view. Still more decisive are the "fruits meet for repentance" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-8.htm" title="Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:">Matthew 3:8</a>. We are to judge of the teaching of those who claim authority by the test of the measure in which, in the long-run, it promotes purity, peace, and holiness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-44.htm">Luke 6:44</a>. (For the first clause, cf also ver. 20 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-33.htm">Matthew 12:33</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall know them by their fruits</span>. Their appearance and their claims are no proof of their true character. It may seem difficult to recognize this, yet there is a sure way of doing so, by their life. The emphasis of the sentence is on "by their fruits." <span class="accented">Ye shall know. Y</span>e shall come to know them to the full (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>).

It is, however, just possible that here and in ver. 20 the plural points to fruit growing on different trees. <span class="cmt_word">Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?</span> The visible outgrowth reveals the nature of that which is within. Those who "profess to combine fellowship with God with the choice of darkness as their sphere of life "(Bishop Westcott, on the suggestive parallel <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6</a>) only show that within they are destitute of fellowship with God. Observe, Christ does not say, "Do thorns produce grapes," etc.? (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-12.htm">James 3:12</a>), but "Do men gather?" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he desires to bring out the way in which men ordinarily deal with productions external to themselves. You, my followers, ought to use that common sense in spiritual matters which men show in matters of everyday life. <span class="accented">Thistles</span>; apparently <span class="accented">Centaurea calcitrapa</span>, the common thistle of Palestine; in the plains the only fuel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:15-20 Nothing so much prevents men from entering the strait gate, and becoming true followers of Christ, as the carnal, soothing, flattering doctrines of those who oppose the truth. They may be known by the drift and effects of their doctrines. Some part of their temper and conduct is contrary to the mind of Christ. Those opinions come not from God that lead to sin.</body></html>
