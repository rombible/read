How was the narrow way to be found? Who would act as guide? Many would offer their help who would simply lead men to the destruction which they sought to escape. Such teachers, claiming authority as inspired, there had been in the days of Isaiah and Jeremiah, and there would be again. The true gift of prophecy is always followed by its counterfeit. Even at the time when our Lord was speaking, the influence of such men as Judas of Galilee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-37.htm" title="After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.">Acts 5:37</a>), Theudas, and other popular leaders, was still fresh in men's memories.<p><span class= "bld">Which come to you in sheep's clothing.</span>--The illustration implies something like the conception of the wolf disguising himself as a sheep in order to gain entrance into the fold. So far a special feature is added to the general allegory of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-12.htm" title="But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees: and the wolf catches them, and scatters the sheep.">John 10:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-29.htm" title="For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.">Acts 20:29</a>. It is possible, though not, I think, probable, that there may be some allusion to the "rough garments," the "sheep-skins and goat-skins" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-37.htm" title="They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;">Hebrews 11:37</a>, worn by false prophets of the hermit or ascetic type.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-23.</span> - Matthew only in this form, though most of the separate verses have much matter common to other passages; viz.: vers. 16, 18, parallel with <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-43.htm">Luke 6:43, 44</a>, cf. also <span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-33.htm">Matthew 12:33</a>; ver. 19, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-10.htm">Matthew 3:10</a>; ver. 21, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-46.htm">Luke 6:46</a>; ver. 22, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-26.htm">Luke 13:26</a>; ver. 23, parallel with <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-27.htm">Luke 13:27</a>.

The warning against being led from the right entrance and the right way is all the more emphatic for there being no adversative particle in the true text. <span class="cmt_word">Beware of false prophets</span>. The whole class of them (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). Not, observe, "false teachers" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>), as though these persons only falsely interpreted fundamental truths, but "false prophets," as falsely claiming to bring messages from God. They claim to bring from God the true message of salvation, but their claim is false. These were doubtless found, at the time that our Lord spoke the words, especially among the Pharisees; but when St. Matthew recorded them, chiefly among Christians, either on the Jewish or on the Gnostic side (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20, 21</a>; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a> and 'Did.,' &sect; 12.). <span class="cmt_word">Which</span>; qualitative (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f35;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); seeing that they. <span class="cmt_word">Come unto you in sheep's clothing.</span> In, as it were, the skins of sheep (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), professing simplicity and gentleness, and (for, perhaps, this thought is also included) claiming to be members of God's true flock. Externally they are all this, but at heart they are something very different. <span class="cmt_word">But inwardly they are ravening wolves</span>. The thought of "ravening" (<span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) is of both violence and greed. These false prophets are not merely wicked at heart and opposed to the truth, but they wish to injure you, and that for their own gain (cf <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-13.htm">Galatians 6:13</a>). "Of the ravenousness of wolves among the Jewes, take these two examples besides others. <span class="accented">The elders proclaimed a fast in their cities upon this occasion</span>, <span class="accented">because the wolves had devoured two little children beyond Jordan.

They may be known by the drift and effects of their doctrines. Some part of their temper and conduct is contrary to the mind of Christ. Those opinions come not from God that lead to sin.</body></html>
