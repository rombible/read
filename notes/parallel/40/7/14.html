The idea is developed as we advance; the life becomes "eternal," and finally we are taught that the eternal life consists in the true and perfect knowledge of God and Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/17-2.htm" title="As you have given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as you have given him.">John 17:2-3</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Few there be that find it.</span>--The sad contrast between the many and the few runs through all our Lord's teaching. He comes to "save the world," and yet those whom He chooses out of the world are but as a "little flock." They are to preach the gospel, and yet the result will be but discord and division. The picture is a dark one, and yet it represents but too faithfully the impression made, I do not say on Calvinist or even Christian, but on any ethical teacher, by the actual state of mankind around us. They are, for the most part, unconscious of the greatness of their lives, and of the interests at stake in them. If there is any wider hope, it is found in hints and suggestions of the possibilities of the future (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-19.htm" title="By which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;">1Peter 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-6.htm" title="For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.">1Peter 4:6</a>); in the fact that the words used are emphatically present; in the belief that the short span of this life is not necessarily the whole of the discipline of a soul made for eternity; and that the new life, nascent, and feeble, and stunted here, may be quickened by some new process of education into higher energies.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - Because (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">for</span> (Revised Version); "many ancient authorities read, <span class="accented">How narrow is the gate</span>, etc." (Revised Version margin). The reading, "how" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span>) is much easier, as avoiding the difficulty of the connexion of this verse with the preceding, but probably <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is right. The connexion is <span class="accented">either</span> that it is parallel to the first <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, and thus gives a second reason for decision in entering through the narrow gate; <span class="accented">or</span>, and better, that it gives the reason for the statement in ver. 13b - many pass along the wrong way because the right way requires at the very outset so much determination and afterwards so much self denial. <span class="cmt_word">Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way;</span> <span class="accented">narrow is the gate</span>, <span class="accented">and straitened the way</span> (Revised Version).

Observe, Christ does not say, "life eternal." He only cares to emphasize the thought of life in the fullest nature of life - life as "the fulfilment of the highest idea of being: perfect truth in perfect action" (Bishop Westcott, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-14.htm">1 John 3:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And few there be that</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">and few be they that</span> (ver. 13, note). Our Lord here affirms more than the disciples ask in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-23.htm">Luke 13:23</a>; for there the question deals with those in a state of salvation (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), here those finally saved. <span class="cmt_word">Find it</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the gate and all it leads to. The narrow gate is here looked at as involving life. <span class="accented">Find.</span> It needs a search (contrast ver. 13). But there is the promise of ver. 7, "Seek, and ye shall find." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:12-14 Christ came to teach us, not only what we are to know and believe, but what we are to do; not only toward God, but toward men; not only toward those of our party and persuasion, but toward men in general, all with whom we have to do. We must do that to our neighbour which we ourselves acknowledge to be fit and reasonable. We must, in our dealings with men, suppose ourselves in the same case and circumstances with those we have to do with, and act accordingly. There are but two ways right and wrong, good and evil; the way to heaven and the way to hell; in the one or other of these all are walking: there is no middle place hereafter, no middle way now. All the children of men are saints or sinners, godly or ungodly. See concerning the way of sin and sinners, that the gate is wide, and stands open. You may go in at this gate with all your lusts about you; it gives no check to appetites or passions. It is a broad way; there are many paths in it; there is choice of sinful ways. There is a large company in this way. But what profit is there in being willing to go to hell with others, because they will not go to heaven with us? The way to eternal life is narrow. We are not in heaven as soon as we are got through the strait gate. Self must be denied, the body kept under, and corruptions mortified. Daily temptations must be resisted; duties must be done. We must watch in all things, and walk with care; and we must go through much tribulation. And yet this way should invite us all; it leads to life: to present comfort in the favour of God, which is the life of the soul; to eternal bliss, the hope of which at the end of our way, should make all the difficulties of the road easy to us. This plain declaration of Christ has been disregarded by many who have taken pains to explain it away; but in all ages the real disciple of Christ has been looked on as a singular, unfashionable character; and all that have sided with the greater number, have gone on in the broad road to destruction. If we would serve God, we must be firm in our religion. Can we often hear of the strait gate and the narrow way, and how few there are that find it, without being in pain for ourselves, or considering whether we are entered on the narrow way, and what progress we are making in it?</body></html>
