The latent sequence of thought would seem to be this, "If the work of reforming others and ourselves," men might say, "is so difficult, how shall we dare to enter on it? Where shall we find the courage and the wisdom which we need?" And the answer is, In prayer for those gifts.<p>Here, once more, the words are absolute and unqualified, and yet are clearly limited by implied conditions. It is assumed (1) that we ask for good gifts--for "bread" and not for a "stone," for a "fish" and not for a "serpent;" and (2) that we ask, as Christ has taught us, in His name and according to His spirit. Otherwise we may ask and receive not, because we ask amiss.<p>The three words imply distinct degrees of intensity. There is the "asking" in the spoken words of prayer, the "seeking" in the efforts and labours which are acted prayers, the "knocking" at the gate with the urgent importunity which claims admission into our Father's house.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-11.</span> - <span class="accented">Ask</span>, <span class="accented">and it shall be given you</span>, etc. Parallel passage: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-9.htm">Luke 11:9-13</a>. Nearly verbally identical, but in the son's request, reads "<span class="accented">egg"</span> and "<span class="accented">scorpion"</span> for "bread" and "stone," and reverses the order of the sentences. In Luke the verses are closely connected ("and I say unto you") with the parable of the friend at midnight, which itself immediately follows the Lord's Prayer. It seems probable that, as with the Lord's Prayer (ch. 6:9-13, note), so with these verses, the original position is given in Luke; yet, as also with the Lord's Prayer, Matthew's form of the individual clauses may be the more original (cf. ver. 11, note). With the general promise contained in these verses, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-24.htm">Mark 11:24</a>. The connexion with the preceding verse is probably not <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> pray for others who have no apparent capacity for receiving the truths of the gospel (Weiss); nor <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in answer to the question suggested by ver. 6, if this be the measure of the Divine dealings, what bounties can sinners expect at God's hands? Let them, nevertheless, ask of God, and it shall be given them (cf. Alford); but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> in close connexion with the whole subject from vers. 1-6, you feel conscious of want of wisdom for the true and loving judgment of others without censoriousness - ask for this special grace. With this connexion ver. 12 follows on naturally; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the key to the right treatment of others may be found in one's own feelings and wishes; from the perception of what we desire to receive from others we may learn what others ought to receive from us. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ask... seek... knock</span>. Gradation in urgency. Further, the three clauses think of the Giver, the sphere in which the gift lies, the obstacles in the way of obtaining it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:7-11 Prayer is the appointed means for obtaining what we need. Pray; pray often; make a business of prayer, and be serious and earnest in it. Ask, as a beggar asks alms. Ask, as a traveller asks the way. Seek, as for a thing of value that we have lost; or as the merchantman that seeks goodly pearls. Knock, as he that desires to enter into the house knocks at the door. Sin has shut and barred the door against us; by prayer we knock. Whatever you pray for, according to the promise, shall be given you, if God see it fit for you, and what would you have more? This is made to apply to all that pray aright; every one that asketh receiveth, whether Jew or Gentile, young or old, rich or poor, high or low, master or servant, learned or unlearned, all are alike welcome to the throne of grace, if they come in faith. It is explained by a comparison taken from earthly parents, and their readiness to give their children what they ask. Parents are often foolishly fond, but God is all-wise; he knows what we need, what we desire, and what is fit for us. Let us never suppose our heavenly Father would bid us pray, and then refuse to hear, or give us what would be hurtful.</body></html>
