Safed, the "city set on a hill," or some other, with the narrow pathway leading to the yet narrower gate, the "needle's eye" of the city, through which the traveller entered. Such, at any rate, was the picture which the words presented. A like image had been used before, with a singular coincidence of language, in the allegory known as the <span class= "ital">Tablet</span> of Cebes, the Disciple of Socrates: "Seest thou not a certain small door, and a pathway before the door, in no way crowded, but few, very few, go in thereat? This is the way that leadeth to true discipline" (c. 16). The meaning of the parable here lies on the surface. The way and the gate are alike the way of obedience and holiness, and the gate is to be reached not without pain and effort; but only through it can we enter into the city of God, the heavenly Jerusalem. A deeper significance is, however, suggested even by our Lord's own teaching. He Himself is the "way" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-6.htm" title="Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me.">John 14:6</a>), or with a slight variation of the imagery, He is the "door," or gate, by which His sheep enter into the fold (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-7.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.">John 10:7</a>). Only we must remember that His being thus the "way" and the "gate" does not mean that we can find, in union with Him, a substitute for holiness, but indicates simply how we are to attain to it.<p><span class= "bld">That leadeth to destruction.</span>--The question, which has been much discussed lately, whether this word "destruction" means the extinction of conscious life--what is popularly called annihilation--or prolonged existence in endless suffering, is one which can hardly be settled by mere reference to lexicons. So far as they go, the word implies, not annihilation, but waste (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-8.htm" title="But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?">Matthew 26:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-4.htm" title="And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?">Mark 14:4</a>), perdition, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the loss of all that makes existence precious. I question whether a single passage can be adduced in which it means, in relation to material things, more than the breaking up of their outward form and beauty, or in spiritual things, more than what may be described as the wretchedness of a wasted life. The use of the cognate verb confirms this meaning. Men "perish" when they are put to death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-7.htm" title="But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.">Matthew 22:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-37.htm" title="After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.">Acts 5:37</a>; <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Caiaphas gave his counsel that one man should die for the people, that the whole nation <span class= "ital">perish</span> not (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-50.htm" title="Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.">John 11:50</a>). The demons ask whether the Christ has come to <span class= "ital">destroy</span> them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-24.htm" title="Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with you, you Jesus of Nazareth? are you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the Holy One of God.">Mark 1:24</a>). The sheep are <span class= "ital">lost</span> when they are wandering in the wilderness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-24.htm" title="But he answered and said, I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.">Matthew 15:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-6.htm" title="And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.">Luke 15:6</a>). The immediate context leads to the same conclusion. "Life" is more than mere existence. "Destruction," by parity of reasoning, should be more than mere non-existence. On the other hand, the fact of the waste, the loss, the perdition, does not absolutely exclude the possibility of deliverance. The <span class= "ital">lost</span> sheep was found; the exiled son, <span class= "ital">perishing</span> with hunger, was brought back to his father's house.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-27.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> <span class="accented">Epilogue</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>, note). Dare to take up this position, which has been laid down in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21 - 7:12</a>, involving though it must separation from the majority of men (vers. 13, 14); and this notwithstanding the claim of others to reveal the Lord's mind, whose true nature, however, you shall perceive from their actions (vers. 15-20); they that work iniquity have neither present nor future union with me (vers. 21-23). Finally a solemn warning (vers. 24-27). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - For vers. 13, 14, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-23.htm">Luke 13:23, 24</a>, which, however (notwithstanding the similarity of vers. 25-27 to our vers. 21-23), were probably spoken later, and were perhaps suggested to both the disciples and the Master by this earlier saying. On the other hand, our ver. 14 seems so direct an answer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-23.htm">Luke 13:23</a> that it is not unlikely that this is one of the many passages placed by St. Matthew, or the authors of his sources, out of chronological order. Enter ye in. Show immediate energy and determination. Observe: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> In Luke, "strive (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) to enter in"; here, "enter at once." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> In Luke, "through the narrow door" into, apparently, the final abiding-place; here, "through the narrow gate" into apparently the (perhaps long) road which takes us at last to full salvation. Thus in Luke our Lord speaks of continued striving; here, of immediate decision, in which, however, lies the assurance of ultimate success (cf. ver. 14, end; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-13.htm">1 John 2:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">At the strait gate</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">by the narrow gate</span> - <span class="accented">the</span> entrance resembling the road (ver. 14, note). Chrysostom (<span class="accented">in lot.</span>), contrasting present trials with future happiness, says, "straitened is the way and narrow is the gate, <span class="accented">but not the city."</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>For wide is the gate, and Broad is the way</span>. So also the Revised Version, but the Revised Version margin has, "some ancient authorities omit <span class="accented">is the gate."</span> (For a full discussion on the difficult question of the genuineness of <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span> here, <span class="accented">vide</span> Westcott and Hort, 'App.') Westcott and Hort omit it, with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, Old Latin, and many Greek and Latin Fathers, and say that, though <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span> is probably genuine in ver. 14, "till the latter part of the fourth century the first <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;</span> has no Greek or Latin patristic evidence in its favour, much against it." They think this is "one of those rare readings in which the true text has been preserved by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> without extant uncial support... . It was natural to scribes to set ver. 13 in precisely antithetic contrast to ver. 14; but the sense gains in force if there is no mention of two gates, and if the contrast in ver. 13 is between the narrow gate and the broad and spacious way." There must be a definite entering upon the right way; no entrance upon the wrong way is necessary, men find themselves upon it only too easily, and it is "made level with stones" (Ecclus. 21:10). <span class="cmt_word">Wide... broad</span>. The second epithet (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) lays stress on there being plenty of space to walk in (Latt., <span class="accented">spatiosa</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>That</span> <span class="cmt_word">leadeth to destruction</span> (<span class="greek_word">ei) th\n a)pw/leian</span>); that "perishing" in which "the sons of perishing" perish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-12.htm">John 17:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And many there be which</span>; Revised Version, more exactly, <span class="accented">and many be they that</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). Our Lord says that they that are perishing are many (cf. ver. 14, note). <span class="cmt_word">Go in</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">enter in</span>; keeping up the allusion to "enter ye in." Observe, however, that if <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span> (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>) is false, the thought here is of entrance into the final issue of the way - <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Thereat</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">thereby</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by the way. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:12-14 Christ came to teach us, not only what we are to know and believe, but what we are to do; not only toward God, but toward men; not only toward those of our party and persuasion, but toward men in general, all with whom we have to do. We must do that to our neighbour which we ourselves acknowledge to be fit and reasonable. We must, in our dealings with men, suppose ourselves in the same case and circumstances with those we have to do with, and act accordingly. There are but two ways right and wrong, good and evil; the way to heaven and the way to hell; in the one or other of these all are walking: there is no middle place hereafter, no middle way now. All the children of men are saints or sinners, godly or ungodly. See concerning the way of sin and sinners, that the gate is wide, and stands open. You may go in at this gate with all your lusts about you; it gives no check to appetites or passions. It is a broad way; there are many paths in it; there is choice of sinful ways. There is a large company in this way. But what profit is there in being willing to go to hell with others, because they will not go to heaven with us? The way to eternal life is narrow. We are not in heaven as soon as we are got through the strait gate. Self must be denied, the body kept under, and corruptions mortified. Daily temptations must be resisted; duties must be done. We must watch in all things, and walk with care; and we must go through much tribulation. And yet this way should invite us all; it leads to life: to present comfort in the favour of God, which is the life of the soul; to eternal bliss, the hope of which at the end of our way, should make all the difficulties of the road easy to us. This plain declaration of Christ has been disregarded by many who have taken pains to explain it away; but in all ages the real disciple of Christ has been looked on as a singular, unfashionable character; and all that have sided with the greater number, have gone on in the broad road to destruction. If we would serve God, we must be firm in our religion. Can we often hear of the strait gate and the narrow way, and how few there are that find it, without being in pain for ourselves, or considering whether we are entered on the narrow way, and what progress we are making in it?</body></html>
