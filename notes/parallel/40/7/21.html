Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?">Matthew 7:16</a> above given. A further development of the same thought is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-17.htm" title="If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.">John 7:17</a>, and we are taught that it is by doing the will of God ourselves, or rather by <span class= "ital">willing</span> to do it, that we gain the power to distinguish, so far as we need distinguish, truth from error, man's teaching from God's.<p>The previous words imply that the disciples had already begun to use the title Lord (<span class= "greekheb">??????</span>) in speaking to their Master (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-8.htm" title="When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.">Luke 5:8</a>); but as that word was at the time in common use as one of courtesy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-2.htm" title="And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.">Matthew 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-6.htm" title="And saying, Lord, my servant lies at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.">Matthew 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-2.htm" title="Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.">John 20:2</a>), it would not necessarily follow that they had used it in all the later fulness of its meaning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-23.</span> - These verses stand in close connexion with vers. 15-20. Seeing that external actions are the result of internal life, it is they, not words nor even miracles (since these may in themselves not be dependent on the inner life, though permitted by the Divine power), by which the true followers of Christ will be finally distinguished from others, and which therefore will alone secure admission to abiding with Christ in the kingdom of heaven. To these verses <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-23.htm">Luke 13:23-28</a> have many resemblances (cf. also vers. 13, 14, <span class="accented">supra</span>). St. Luke thus omits the warning against false teachers. (For ver. 21, cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-46.htm">Luke 6:46</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord</span>. Professing obedience (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>). Observe the indirect claim to this title of reverential submission and the implied expectation that it will be given him by many. <span class="cmt_word">Shall enter into the kingdom</span> <span class="cmt_word">of heaven.</span> The final goal of our hopes. <span class="cmt_word">But</span> <span class="cmt_word">he that doeth the will of my Father.</span> Not "of me," but of him whom I represent, and to whom I stand in a unique relation (observe the claim). This man also says, "Lord, Lord" (Winer, &sect; 26:1), but not merely <span class="accented">says</span> it. Such a man enters into family relationship to Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-50.htm">Matthew 12:50</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which is in heaven</span>. Since you desire to enter the kingdom of heaven, be now obeying the will of him who dwells in heaven. (For the thought of the verse, cf <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-4.htm">1 John 2:4</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:21-29 Christ here shows that it will not be enough to own him for our Master, only in word and tongue. It is necessary to our happiness that we believe in Christ, that we repent of sin, that we live a holy life, that we love one another. This is his will, even our sanctification. Let us take heed of resting in outward privileges and doings, lest we deceive ourselves, and perish eternally, as multitudes do, with a lie in our right hand. Let every one that names the name of Christ, depart from all sin. There are others, whose religion rests in bare hearing, and it goes no further; their heads are filled with empty notions. These two sorts of hearers are represented as two builders. This parable teaches us to hear and do the sayings of the Lord Jesus: some may seem hard to flesh and blood, but they must be done. Christ is laid for a foundation, and every thing besides Christ is sand. Some build their hopes upon worldly prosperity; others upon an outward profession of religion. Upon these they venture; but they are all sand, too weak to bear such a fabric as our hopes of heaven. There is a storm coming that will try every man's work. When God takes away the soul, where is the hope of the hypocrite? The house fell in the storm, when the builder had most need of it, and expected it would be a shelter to him. It fell when it was too late to build another. May the Lord make us wise builders for eternity. Then nothing shall separate us from the love of Christ Jesus. The multitudes were astonished at the wisdom and power of Christ's doctrine. And this sermon, ever so often read over, is always new. Every word proves its Author to be Divine. Let us be more and more decided and earnest, making some one or other of these blessednesses and Christian graces the main subject of our thoughts, even for weeks together. Let us not rest in general and confused desires after them, whereby we grasp at all, but catch nothing.</body></html>
