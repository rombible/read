There was an obvious fitness in the symbolism of the Resurrection of the Son of Righteousness coinciding with the natural "day-spring." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-78.htm" title="Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high has visited us,">Luke 1:78</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Come, see the place.</span>--Comp. the description in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/20-5.htm" title="And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.">John 20:5-6</a>, the "linen clothes," or bandages, that had swathed the limbs, the napkin, or <span class= "ital">sudarium,</span> that had veiled the face.<p>The report in St. Mark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/16-6.htm" title="And he said to them, Be not affrighted: You seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.">Mark 16:6-7</a>) nearly coincides with this. St. Luke is somewhat fuller (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/24-5.htm" title="And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said to them, Why seek you the living among the dead?">Luke 24:5-7</a>), introducing the question, "Why seek ye the living among the dead?" and a more detailed reference to our Lord's prophecies of His resurrection.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He is not here.</span> He is not in this tomb; his bodily presence is removed from this his whilom resting place. St. Matthew's account is greatly condensed, and omits many details which harmonists try to fit into our text. The attempt is not to be commended, for it really involves greater confusion, and, after all, is forced and only conjectural. <span class="cmt_word">For he is risen, as he said.</span> If they had believed Christ's often-repeated announcement, they would not have come seeking the living among the dead. (For Christ's predictions concerning his resurrection, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-23.htm">Matthew 17:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a>.) On this simple, but pregnant sentence, "He is risen," depends the phenomenon of Christianity, in its origin, existence, continuance, extension, and moral power. "Death began with woman; and to women the first announcement is made of resurrection" (Hilary, quoted by Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). <span class="cmt_word">Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</span> The angel invites them to satisfy themselves that Christ's body was no longer in its resting place. That Jesus was designated as "the Lord," <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, by the disciples is obvious (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-18.htm">John 20:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-7.htm">John 21:7</a>, etc.), but it is doubtful whether the words are genuine here, though they are found in many good manuscripts and in the Vulgate. They are omitted by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, 33, etc., and by Tischendorf and Westcott and Hort in their editions. Regarding them as genuine, Bengel calls them "gloriosa appellatio," which indeed it is, for it is equivalent to "Jehovah." Harmonists suppose that the angel was at first not seen by the women; that Mary Magdalene, observing the stone removed, at once hurried to the city to tell Peter and John; that, the rest of the women remaining, the angel made himself visible to them and bade them enter the sepulchre; and that, doing so, they beheld another angel sitting on the right side of the recess. Thus, it is conjectured, the accounts in Mark and John may be harmonized with that in our text. (See also Westcott on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20.htm">John 20</a>, where is given a provisional arrangement of the facts of the first Easter Day.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-8 Christ rose the third day after his death; that was the time he had often spoken of. On the first day of the first week God commanded the light to shine out of darkness. On this day did He who is the Light of the world, shine out of the darkness of the grave; and this day is from henceforward often mentioned in the New Testament, as the day which Christians religiously observed in solemn assemblies, to the honour of Christ. Our Lord Jesus could have rolled back the stone by his own power, but he chose to have it done by an angel. The resurrection of Christ, as it is the joy of his friends, so it is the terror and confusion of his enemies. The angel encouraged the women against their fears. Let the sinners in Zion be afraid. Fear not ye, for his resurrection will be your consolation. Our communion with him must be spiritual, by faith in his word. When we are ready to make this world our home, and to say, It is good to be here, then let us remember our Lord Jesus is not here, he is risen; therefore let our hearts rise, and seek the things that are above. He is risen, as he said. Let us never think that strange which the word of Christ has told us to expect; whether the sufferings of this present time, or the glory that is to be revealed. It may have a good effect upon us, by faith to view the place where the Lord lay. Go quickly. It was good to be there, but the servants of God have other work appointed. Public usefulness must be chosen before the pleasure of secret communion with God. Tell the disciples, that they may be comforted under their present sorrows. Christ knows where his disciples dwell, and will visit them. Even to those at a distance from the plenty of the means of grace, he will graciously manifest himself. The fear and the joy together quickened their pace. The disciples of Christ should be forward to make known to each other their experiences of communion with their Lord; and should tell others what God has done for their souls.</body></html>
