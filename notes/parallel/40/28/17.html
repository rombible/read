The act, as has been said, was not new in itself, but it seems certain that our Lord's manifestations of His Presence after the Resurrection had made the faith of the disciples stronger and clearer (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-28.htm" title="And Thomas answered and said to him, My LORD and my God.">John 20:28</a>), and so the act acquired a new significance.<p><span class= "bld">Some doubted.</span>--It seems hard at first to conceive how those who had been present in the upper chamber at Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/20-19.htm" title="Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the middle, and said to them, Peace be to you.">John 20:19-26</a>) could still feel doubt; but the narrative of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-4.htm" title="But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.">John 21:4</a> throws some light upon it. There was something mysterious and supernatural in the manifestation of the glorified body--outlines, at first indistinct and scarcely recognised, and then the whole form seen as it had been seen in life. The more devoted and loving disciples were probably, here as before, the first to recognise their Lord. Others questioned whether it was a phantom (comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-26.htm" title="And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.">Matthew 14:26</a>) or a reality.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They worshipped him.</span> Evidently here they, or the majority of those present (for it is plain that others beside the apostles were there), adored him as God and Lord. This is the first time that this action of supreme worship is mentioned in connection with the disciples, though the women had offered the same homage to him (ver. 9). <span class="cmt_word">But</span> <span class="cmt_word">some doubted</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> - without <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> - <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). (For the verb, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-31.htm">Matthew 14:31</a>.) The doubters could not have been any of the eleven, for they had seen the Lord more than once at Jerusalem, and had had indubitable proofs that he had risen from the dead, and was no mere spirit or spiritual appearance, but possessed of his former body, with new powers, faculties, and laws. Those who for the moment doubted did not hesitate to acknowledge his resurrection, but his identity. They were, perhaps, at a distance. Christ may have appeared surrounded with heavenly glory; at any rate, in a shape, or vesture, or with an aspect with which they were not familiar; hence in this majestic form, they failed to recognize the "despised and rejected of men," the lowly Jesus whom they had known (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-4.htm">John 21:4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:16-20 This evangelist passes over other appearances of Christ, recorded by Luke and John, and hastens to the most solemn; one appointed before his death, and after his resurrection. All that see the Lord Jesus with an eye of faith, will worship him. Yet the faith of the sincere may be very weak and wavering. But Christ gave such convincing proofs of his resurrection, as made their faith to triumph over doubts. He now solemnly commissioned the apostles and his ministers to go forth among all nations. The salvation they were to preach, is a common salvation; whoever will, let him come, and take the benefit; all are welcome to Christ Jesus. Christianity is the religion of a sinner who applies for salvation from deserved wrath and from sin; he applies to the mercy of the Father, through the atonement of the incarnate Son, and by the sanctification of the Holy Spirit, and gives up himself to be the worshipper and servant of God, as the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, three Persons but one God, in all his ordinances and commandments. Baptism is an outward sign of that inward washing, or sanctification of the Spirit, which seals and evidences the believer's justification. Let us examine ourselves, whether we really possess the inward and spiritual grace of a death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness, by which those who were the children of wrath become the children of God. Believers shall have the constant presence of their Lord always; all days, every day. There is no day, no hour of the day, in which our Lord Jesus is not present with his churches and with his ministers; if there were, in that day, that hour, they would be undone. The God of Israel, the Saviour, is sometimes a God that hideth himself, but never a God at a distance. To these precious words Amen is added. Even so, Lord Jesus, be thou with us and all thy people; cause thy face to shine upon us, that thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations.</body></html>
