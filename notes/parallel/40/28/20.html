But we may well believe that they went further than this, and that the words may cover much unrecorded teaching which they had heard in the darkness, and were to reproduce in light (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-27.htm" title="What I tell you in darkness, that speak you in light: and what you hear in the ear, that preach you on the housetops.">Matthew 10:27</a>).<p><span class= "bld">I am with you alway.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">all the days,</span> or, <span class= "ital">at all times;</span> the words emphasising continuity more than the English adverb.

Like all such words, its meaning widens or contracts according to our point of view. Here the context determines its significance as stretching forward to the end of the age, or aeon, which began with the first Advent of the Christ and shall last until the second.<p>We ask, as we close the Gospel, why it ends thus? why there should be no record of a fact so momentous as the Ascension? The question is one which we cannot fully answer. There is an obvious abruptness in the close of the book as a book. It may be that it was left unfinished. It may be that the fact of the Ascension entered into the elementary instruction of every catechumen, and was therefore taken for granted; or that it was thought of as implied in the promise of Christ's perpetual presence; or, lastly, that that promise seemed, in its grandeur and its blessedness, to be the consummation of all that Christ had come to accomplish, and therefore as the fitting close of the record of His life and work.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Teaching</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">them</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> all the nations) <span class="cmt_word">to observe all things</span>, etc. The word for "teaching" is quite different from that used in ver. 19, and there wrongly translated. Instruction is the second necessary condition for discipleship. In the case of adults, as was said above, some teaching must precede the initiation; but this has to be supplemented subsequently in order to build up the convert in the faith and make him perfect; while infants must be taught "as soon as they are able to learn, what a solemn vow, promise, and profession they have here made." All must be taught the Christian faith and duty, and how to obtain God's help to enable them to please him, and to continue in the way of salvation, so that they may "die from sin, and rise again unto righteousness; continually mortifying all their evil and corrupt affections, and daily proceeding in all virtue and godliness of living" ('Public Baptism of Infants'). "He gives," says St. Chrysostom, "the one charge with a view to doctrine [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the form of baptism], the other concerning commandments" ('Horn.,' 90.). All that Christ commanded, both in doctrine and morals, all that he had taught and enjoined during the three past years, they were henceforward to take as their textbook, and enforce on all who were admitted into the Church by baptism. As the Greek is, "I commanded," being aorist and not perfect, it may be rightly opined that Christ here alludes also to various details which he set forth and enjoined during these great forty days, between his resurrection and ascension, when he gave commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen, and spake to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-2.htm">Acts 1:2, 3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And, lo.</span> "After that, because he had enjoined on them great things, to raise their courage, he <span class="accented">says.</span> Lo! "etc. (Chrysostom). <span class="cmt_word">I am with you alway</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). Every word is emphatic. The Ascension was at hand; this implied an absence of his visible presence, to be replaced by a spiritual presence, more perfect, potent, effectual, infinite. It is I myself, I, God and Man,who am (not "will be") henceforward ever present among you, with you as Companion, Friend, Guide, Saviour, God. I am with you in all your ministrations, prayers public and private, baptisms, communions, exhortations, doctrine, discipline And this, not now and then, not at certain times only, but "all the days" of your pilgrimage, all the dark days of trial and persecution and affliction; all the days when you, my apostles, are gathered to your rest, and have committed your work to other hands; my presence shall never be withdrawn for a single moment. Often had God made an analogous promise to his servants under the old dispensation - to Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>), to Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-23.htm">Deuteronomy 31:23</a>), to Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8</a>); but this spiritual presence of Christ is something unknown to previous history, a nearness unspeakable, in the Church at large and in the Christian's heart. <span class="cmt_word">Even unto the end of the world;</span> <span class="accented">the consummation of the age</span>, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a> (where see note). When the new era is ushered in, evangelizing work will cease; God shall be all in all; all shall know him from the least unto the greatest. And they shall ever be with the Lord; "wherefore comfort one another with these words" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Amen</span>. The word is here an interpolation, but it expresses what every pious reader must say in his heart, "So be it, O Lord; be with us unto the end; guide and strengthen us in life, and bring us safely through the valley of the shadow of death, to thy blessed presence, where is the fulness of joy forevermore!" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:16-20 This evangelist passes over other appearances of Christ, recorded by Luke and John, and hastens to the most solemn; one appointed before his death, and after his resurrection. All that see the Lord Jesus with an eye of faith, will worship him. Yet the faith of the sincere may be very weak and wavering. But Christ gave such convincing proofs of his resurrection, as made their faith to triumph over doubts. He now solemnly commissioned the apostles and his ministers to go forth among all nations. The salvation they were to preach, is a common salvation; whoever will, let him come, and take the benefit; all are welcome to Christ Jesus. Christianity is the religion of a sinner who applies for salvation from deserved wrath and from sin; he applies to the mercy of the Father, through the atonement of the incarnate Son, and by the sanctification of the Holy Spirit, and gives up himself to be the worshipper and servant of God, as the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, three Persons but one God, in all his ordinances and commandments. Baptism is an outward sign of that inward washing, or sanctification of the Spirit, which seals and evidences the believer's justification. Let us examine ourselves, whether we really possess the inward and spiritual grace of a death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness, by which those who were the children of wrath become the children of God. Believers shall have the constant presence of their Lord always; all days, every day. There is no day, no hour of the day, in which our Lord Jesus is not present with his churches and with his ministers; if there were, in that day, that hour, they would be undone. The God of Israel, the Saviour, is sometimes a God that hideth himself, but never a God at a distance. To these precious words Amen is added. Even so, Lord Jesus, be thou with us and all thy people; cause thy face to shine upon us, that thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations.</body></html>
