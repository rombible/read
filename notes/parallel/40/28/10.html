With all their joy and love, the women could not help feeling fear at his sudden appearance and at the nearness of this unearthly yet familiar form. <span class="cmt_word">Go, tell my brethren.</span> He here for the first time calls his disciples his brethren, intending thereby to assure them of his love and good will in spite of their cowardly desertion, and to signify that he was in very truth the Man Christ Jesus, their Lord and their Master, whom they had known so long and so well. He had called them friends before his Passion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-14.htm">John 15:14, 15</a>); now he gives them a tenderer title; he is not ashamed to call them brethren (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That they go</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">in order that they may depart</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>into Galilee.</span> The message is the same as that given by the angel (ver. 7).

But they were not to set out immediately; some other incidents were first to befall them. <span class="cmt_word">And there shall they see me.</span> Galilee was to be the scene of the most important revelation, though the Lord vouchsafed to individuals many proofs of his risen life before the promised great announcement. Why St. Matthew mentions none of these we may form conjectures, but we cannot determine (see on ver. 16). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:9,10 God's gracious visits usually meet us in the way of duty; and to those who use what they have for others' benefit, more shall be given. This interview with Christ was unexpected; but Christ was nigh them, and still is nigh us in the word. The salutation speaks the good-will of Christ to man, even since he entered upon his state of exaltation. It is the will of Christ that his people should be a cheerful, joyful people, and his resurrection furnishes abundant matter for joy. Be not afraid. Christ rose from the dead, to silence his people's fears, and there is enough in that to silence them. The disciples had just before shamefully deserted him in his sufferings; but, to show that he could forgive, and to teach us to do so, he calls them brethren. Notwithstanding his majesty and purity, and our meanness and unworthiness, he still condescends to call believers his brethren.</body></html>
