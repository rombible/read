The discrepancies, such as they are, at any rate, show that the narratives were independent. The best solution of the questions presented by a comparison of the Gospel narrative at this stage is that Mary Magdalene ran eagerly to tell Peter and John, leaving the other Mary and Joanna (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-10.htm" title="It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things to the apostles.">Luke 24:10</a>), and then followed in the rear of the two disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-2.htm" title="Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.">John 20:2</a>). Then when they had left, the Lord showed Himself first to her (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-14.htm" title="And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.">John 20:14</a>), and then to the others (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-9.htm" title="And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.">Matthew 28:9</a>), whom she had by that time joined, and then they all hastened together to tell the rest of the disciples.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They departed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, better <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>quickly from the sepulchre.</span> At the angel's invitation (ver. 6), they, or some of them, had entered into the inner chamber of the tomb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-3.htm">Luke 24:3</a>), and now came hurrying out. <span class="cmt_word">With fear and great joy.</span> With a mixture of emotions - fear at the sight of the heavenly visitant, the supernatural presence, and joy at the assurance that their beloved Master had risen again, having burst the bonds of death. <span class="cmt_word">Did run</span>. They did as they were bidden with all possible speed, acting as heralds of good tidings to the disconsolate disciples. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-8 Christ rose the third day after his death; that was the time he had often spoken of. On the first day of the first week God commanded the light to shine out of darkness. On this day did He who is the Light of the world, shine out of the darkness of the grave; and this day is from henceforward often mentioned in the New Testament, as the day which Christians religiously observed in solemn assemblies, to the honour of Christ. Our Lord Jesus could have rolled back the stone by his own power, but he chose to have it done by an angel. The resurrection of Christ, as it is the joy of his friends, so it is the terror and confusion of his enemies. The angel encouraged the women against their fears. Let the sinners in Zion be afraid. Fear not ye, for his resurrection will be your consolation. Our communion with him must be spiritual, by faith in his word. When we are ready to make this world our home, and to say, It is good to be here, then let us remember our Lord Jesus is not here, he is risen; therefore let our hearts rise, and seek the things that are above. He is risen, as he said. Let us never think that strange which the word of Christ has told us to expect; whether the sufferings of this present time, or the glory that is to be revealed. It may have a good effect upon us, by faith to view the place where the Lord lay. Go quickly. It was good to be there, but the servants of God have other work appointed. Public usefulness must be chosen before the pleasure of secret communion with God. Tell the disciples, that they may be comforted under their present sorrows. Christ knows where his disciples dwell, and will visit them. Even to those at a distance from the plenty of the means of grace, he will graciously manifest himself. The fear and the joy together quickened their pace. The disciples of Christ should be forward to make known to each other their experiences of communion with their Lord; and should tell others what God has done for their souls.</body></html>
