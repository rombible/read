There was no need for him to inquire further. His Master would pay it now as He had paid it before (this is clearly implied), as every devout Israelite would pay. Both the application and the answer suggest the thought that our Lord was looked upon as domiciled in the house of Peter. The answer, however, was given without thought of the altered conditions of the case. He had not yet learnt to grasp the full meaning of the truth which he had himself so recently confessed.<p><span class= "bld">Jesus prevented him.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">anticipated,</span> The word is nowhere else used of our Lord's teaching. Its significance is explained by what follows. Peter and the other disciples were about to come to Him with a question of a very different kind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-1.htm" title="At the same time came the disciples to Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?">Matthew 18:1</a>), rising out of their mutual rivalries, and therefore, before that question could be asked, He anticipated the eager disciple that He might lead him on one step further into the mysteries of the kingdom.<p><span class= "bld">Take custom or tribute.</span>--The first word points to the duties on the export or import of goods, the <span class= "ital">octroi,</span> in modern language, levied on provisions as they were brought in or out of towns; the second, as stated above, to the poll-tax paid into the Roman treasury, which followed on the taxing or registration of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-2.htm" title="(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)">Luke 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-37.htm" title="After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.">Acts 5:37</a>. Both were probably farmed by the capitalist <span class= "ital">publicani,</span> and collected by the "publicans" of the Gospels, or other inferior officers.<p><span class= "bld">Of their own children, or of strangers?</span>--The first word can hardly be taken of merely natural relationship. The "children of the kingdom" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-38.htm" title="The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;">Matthew 13:38</a>) are not the king's sons, but his home-born, free subjects. The "strangers" were the aliens, the men of another race, who owned his sovereignty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He saith, Yes.</span> Without consulting his Master, or even letting him know of the demand, Peter answered affirmatively, he knew that Christ never withdrew from conscientious obligations; Jesus may have paid the rate in former years, and might be confidently supposed to be ready to do so again. But was there not another feeling that dictated the quick reply, and made him pledge Jesus to the payment? He had a fear at his heart, caused by Christ's late warning and prophecy, that made him morbidly anxious to live at peace with all men at this conjuncture. As far as in him lay he would shield his beloved Master from the dread result which he anticipated; at any rate, he would endeavour to postpone the fatal day; no offence that he could obviate should be given. So, thinking only of present safety, forgetting or wilfully ignoring Christ's true position, he answered hastily, "Yes." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>When he</span> (Peter) <span class="cmt_word">was come into the house.</span> The collectors had addressed Peter in the street or at the door, and the apostle, having given his reply, hastened into the house where Jesus was, either to obtain the necessary coins or to make the demand known. <span class="cmt_word">Prevented him.</span> The Revised Version paraphrases, <span class="accented">spake first to him</span>, which gives the meaning (though the Greek does not warrant such translation) - Jesus anticipated what Peter was going to say by showing that he knew the apostle's thoughts and all that had passed outside the house, he takes the opportunity of enforcing a needful lesson, making the listener, in the Socratic method, teach himself. <span class="cmt_word">What thinkest thou, Simon?</span> By such familiar address he claims his attention. <span class="cmt_word">The kings of the earth</span>. He contrasts these with the King of heaven, to whom a reference is implied in the Lord's subsequent words. <span class="cmt_word">Custom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>) or tribute (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). The former of these words (which would be better rendered <span class="accented">tolls</span>) signifies the customs laid on goods and merchandise and other such payments - <span class="accented">vectigalia</span>, as the Romans called them; the <span class="accented">tribute</span> (not the same word as that so translated in ver. 24) is the <span class="accented">census</span>, the capitation tax (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) imposed upon every citizen of the empire. <span class="cmt_word">Strangers</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). The contrast is between the family of the monarch and those who are not connected with him by any relationship. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:24-27 Peter felt sure that his Master was ready to do what was right. Christ spoke first to give him proof that no thought can be withholden from him. We must never decline our duty for fear of giving offence; but we must sometimes deny ourselves in our worldly interests, rather than give offence. However the money was lodged in the fish, He who knows all things alone could know it, and only almighty power could bring it to Peter's hook. The power and the poverty of Christ should be mentioned together. If called by providence to be poor, like our Lord, let us trust in his power, and our God shall supply all our need, according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. In the way of obedience, in the course, perhaps, of our usual calling, as he helped Peter, so he will help us. And if any sudden call should occur, which we are not prepared to meet, let us not apply to others, till we first seek Christ.</body></html>
