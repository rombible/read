To the disciples this would, we cannot doubt, recall the "cloudy pillar" which had descended on the first tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-9.htm" title="And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.">Exodus 33:9</a>), the "cloud that filled the house of the Lord on the dedication of the Temple" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-10.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,">1Kings 8:10</a>). It was, in later Jewish language, the Shechinah, or abiding presence of Jehovah--the very form of the word connects it with both the Hebrew (<span class= "ital">mishkan</span>) and the Greek (<span class= "ital">skene</span>) words for tabernacle--which was the symbol that He was with His people. The Targums, or Paraphrases, of the Law and Prophets which were then current, had used the word as a synonym for the divine name. Where the Hebrew text had had "I will dwell in thee," the Targum of Jonathan had "I will make my Shechinah to dwell" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-10.htm" title="Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, see, I come, and I will dwell in the middle of you, said the LORD.">Zechariah 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-3.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; I am returned to Zion, and will dwell in the middle of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.">Zechariah 8:3</a>). Its appearance at this moment, followed by the voice out or the cloud, was a witness that no tabernacle made with hands was now needed, that the humanity of Christ was the true tabernacle of God (comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>), and that it was in this sense true that "the tabernacle of God was with men" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-3.htm" title="And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.">Revelation 21:3</a>), and that He would dwell with them.<p><span class= "bld">This is my beloved Son.</span>--The words were in substance the same as those heard at the baptism of our Lord (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm" title="And see a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">Matthew 3:17</a>), but the difference in their form is suggestive. Then they were addressed to the human consciousness of the Son of Man, as declaring to Him the greatness of His being. Now they come addressed as to the disciples, and in close connection with the "decease" which was to be accomplished at Jerusalem. It was, if we may so speak, because the Son of Man became obedient unto death that He was showing Himself worthy of the Father's love. In the hour of darkness and seeming failure, and agony and death, He was "satisfying" His Father's "good pleasure," and accepted by Him as the one perfect sacrifice. And so the command, "Hear ye Him," gained a new significance. Not the traditions of the elders, or the doctrines of the scribes and Pharisees, not even the teaching of Moses and Elias, of the Law and of the Prophets, but the words of the Son of Man, were henceforth to command their allegiance, and to be the guide of their faith and of their lives, for of them only it was true that the Father was revealed fully in them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/1-1.htm" title="God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>), and that they should never pass away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-35.htm" title="Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.">Matthew 24:35</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A bright cloud overshadowed them.</span> The cloud spread over and around, not Jesus only and the other two, but in some degree over the apostles also, as St. Luke adds, "They feared as they entered into the cloud." It was the Shechinah, the token of the presence of the Most High, who dwelleth in the unapproachable light. It enshrouded Jesus and his two companions, so that mortal eye could not pierce it or even look upon it; but the apostles, who were outside its immediate contact, were in some sort included in its influence, so that it could be said to overshadow them. St. Peter calls it "the excellent glory (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>)" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-17.htm">2 Peter 1:17</a>). The cloud from which on Sinai the old Law was given, was dark and threatening (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-21.htm">Exodus 20:21</a>); this was bright, coming not to terrify, but to teach and to bless. Here is seen the contrast between the two dispensations, the Law and the gospel (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-18.htm">Hebrews 12:18-24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A voice out of the cloud.</span> It was the voice of God the Father, for he called Jesus, <span class="cmt_word">My beloved Son.</span> The same voice, saying the same words, had been heard over the waters of Jordan when Jesus was baptized (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>); it spake once again just before his Passion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-28.htm">John 12:28</a>); at all times witnessing the Father's love and the perfect Divinity of Christ. Now, as before, the Holy Trinity was revealed, the Father speaking with audible voice, the Son standing in radiant light, the Holy Spirit present with the intense brightness of the enveloping cloud. The words heard are fontal in the earlier Scriptures. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a> we read, "Behold my Servant, whom I uphold, my Chosen in whom my soul delighteth;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, "Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee." <span class="cmt_word">Hear ye him.</span> Not Moses and Elias, but Jesus, the Mediator of a better covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a>). "This voice," St. Peter testifies, "we ourselves heard come out of heaven, when we were with him in the holy mount" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-18.htm">2 Peter 1:18</a>). As Edersheim remarks, even if this Epistle is not St. Peter's, it still would represent the most ancient tradition. "God, having of old spoken unto the fathers in the prophets, hath at the end of these days spoken unto us in his Son" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>). The command to hear him recalls the saying of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>), that in good time God would raise up from Israel a Prophet like unto himself, and that unto him they shall hearken. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-13 Now the disciples beheld somewhat of Christ's glory, as of the only begotten of the Father. It was intended to support their faith, when they would have to witness his crucifixion; and would give them an idea of the glory prepared for them, when changed by his power and made like him. The apostles were overcome by the glorious sight. Peter thought that it was most desirable to continue there, and to go no more down to meet the sufferings of which he was so unwilling to hear. In this he knew not what he said. We are wrong, if we look for a heaven here upon earth. Whatever tabernacles we propose to make for ourselves in this world, we must always remember to ask Christ's leave. That sacrifice was not yet offered, without which the souls of sinful men could not have been saved; and important services were to be done by Peter and his brethren. While Peter spoke, a bright cloud overshadowed them, an emblem of the Divine presence and glory. Ever since man sinned, and heard God's voice in the garden, unusual appearances of God have been terrible to man. They fell prostrate to the earth, till Jesus encouraged them; when looking round, they beheld only their Lord as they commonly saw him. We must pass through varied experiences in our way to glory; and when we return to the world after an ordinance, it must be our care to take Christ with us, and then it may be our comfort that he is with us.</body></html>
