It is not easy to trace the thoughts that passed rapidly through the soul of the disciple in that moment of amazement. Afterwards--if we may judge from St. Mark's account (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-6.htm" title="For he knew not what to say; for they were sore afraid.">Mark 9:6</a>), "he knew not what to answer, for they were sore afraid," or St. Luke's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-33.htm" title="And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.">Luke 9:33</a>) "not knowing what he said"--he could hardly explain them himself. We may venture to see in the very <span class= "ital">na�vete </span>of the words a touch of originality and unexpectedness which, as far as it goes, attests the truthfulness of the narrative. What the words seem to imply is:--(1) An abounding joy at being thus brought into a glory which fulfilled the Apostle's brightest hopes. It was, indeed, good to be thus carried, as it were, into Paradise, or the third heaven, and to hear there words which human lips might not reproduce. (2) His thoughts travelled back to the records of the Exodus, when the Lord talked with Moses in the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/33-7.htm" title="And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out to the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.">Exodus 33:7-10</a>). What if like tabernacles could now be made for those three glorious forms, that all Israel might come and gaze, and hear and worship? Would not this be a better consummation than the shame and death at Jerusalem? Would it not meet the belief of the scribes and of the people that "Elias must first come"?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then answered Peter.</span> According to St. Luke, it was when the two Divine prophets were disappearing, or were being withdrawn from sight, that Peter spoke. Bewildered, overcome with joy and astonishment, not knowing what to say (Mark), yet in his excitement and ardour unable to keep silence, he cries to Jesus, <span class="cmt_word">Lord, it is good for us to be here;</span> perhaps equivalent to <span class="accented">to remain here</span>. He includes Moses and Elias in his eager exclamation. Some commentators confine the reference to the three apostles, as if Peter meant that it was "good" that they were present in order to prepare the necessary habitations. This seems meagre and insufficient. Here were peace, seclusion, safety: might they not last? Was there any need to quit this hallowed spot at once, and lose the heavenly company with which it was blessed? <span class="cmt_word">If</span> <span class="cmt_word">thou wilt.</span> Even at this supreme moment, he will not set his will in opposition to his Master's. <span class="cmt_word">Let us make</span> (<span class="accented">I will make</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">here three tabernacles</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>). Booths, of branches and grass, such as were used by travellers camping out, or such as the people erected when celebrating the Feast of Tabernacles. He speaks of but three shelters, regarding only Jesus and the two prophets, and considering himself and his fellow disciples as mere servitors and attendants, for whom no such provision was needed. In his confusion he thinks that if these three remain, they must have some kind of habitation. Like a child, he would fain prolong indefinitely the joy of this great vision; and with a Jew's hankering for a conquering Messiah and the permanence of the old covenant, he desired that from that secure mountain top the laws of the kingdom might be issued, and all men might acknowledge the Christ attended and supported by the great lawgiver and prophet. Was there not also a latent hope that thus might be deferred or laid aside that departure to Jerusalem, with its calamitous consequences? But this was not to be. No answer was vouchsafed to Peter's thoughtless request. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-13 Now the disciples beheld somewhat of Christ's glory, as of the only begotten of the Father. It was intended to support their faith, when they would have to witness his crucifixion; and would give them an idea of the glory prepared for them, when changed by his power and made like him. The apostles were overcome by the glorious sight. Peter thought that it was most desirable to continue there, and to go no more down to meet the sufferings of which he was so unwilling to hear. In this he knew not what he said. We are wrong, if we look for a heaven here upon earth. Whatever tabernacles we propose to make for ourselves in this world, we must always remember to ask Christ's leave. That sacrifice was not yet offered, without which the souls of sinful men could not have been saved; and important services were to be done by Peter and his brethren. While Peter spoke, a bright cloud overshadowed them, an emblem of the Divine presence and glory. Ever since man sinned, and heard God's voice in the garden, unusual appearances of God have been terrible to man. They fell prostrate to the earth, till Jesus encouraged them; when looking round, they beheld only their Lord as they commonly saw him. We must pass through varied experiences in our way to glory; and when we return to the world after an ordinance, it must be our care to take Christ with us, and then it may be our comfort that he is with us.</body></html>
