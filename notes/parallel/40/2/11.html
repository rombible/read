Compare the gifts sent by Jacob to Joseph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-11.htm" title="And their father Israel said to them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:">Genesis 43:11</a>), and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-8.htm" title="All your garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made you glad.">Psalm 45:8</a>, for the myrrh and spices; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-15.htm" title="And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be praised.">Psalm 72:15</a>, for the gold; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-6.htm" title="The multitude of camels shall cover you, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises of the LORD.">Isaiah 60:6</a>, for gold and incense. The patristic interpretation of the gifts as significant--the gold, of kingly power; the incense, of Divinity; the myrrh, of death and embalmment--interesting as it is, cannot be assumed to have been definitely present to the mind of the Evangelist. It is noticeable that there is here no mention of Joseph. Looking to his prominence in St. Matthew's narrative, we must assume that his absence on the night of their arrival was accidental.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when they were come into the house</span>. For after the enrolment the caravanserai would not be so crowded (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-7.htm">Luke 2:7</a>).

The translators in this case followed the text of the Complutensian (1514) and of Colinaeus' edition (1534), rejecting the false <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of the Vulgate and the Received Text<span class="cmt_word">.

Thus fulfilling in germ the predictions of offerings being made to Messiah and Messiah's people by the Gentile nations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-7.htm">Haggai 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a>). <span class="accented">Presented</span>; <span class="accented">offered</span> (Revised Version).

Bishop Westcott, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>) and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span> on the destination and use of the offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-21.htm">James 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-13.htm">Romans 6:13</a>).

Wealth and delights, the material and the aesthetic. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:9-12 What joy these wise men felt upon this sight of the star, none know so well as those who, after a long and melancholy night of temptation and desertion, under the power of a spirit of bondage, at length receive the Spirit of adoption, witnessing with their spirits that they are the children of God. We may well think what a disappointment it was to them, when they found a cottage was his palace, and his own poor mother the only attendant he had. However, these wise men did not think themselves baffled; but having found the King they sought, they presented their gifts to him. The humble inquirer after Christ will not be stumbled at finding him and his disciples in obscure cottages, after having in vain sought them in palaces and populous cities. Is a soul busy, seeking after Christ? Would it worship him, and does it say, Alas! I am a foolish and poor creature, and have nothing to offer? Nothing! Hast thou not a heart, though unworthy of him, dark, hard, and foul? Give it to him as it is, and be willing that he use and dispose of it as it pleases him; he will take it, and will make it better, and thou shalt never repent having given it to him. He shall frame it to his own likeness, and will give thee himself, and be thine for ever. The gifts the wise men presented were gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Providence sent these as a seasonable relief to Joseph and Mary in their present poor condition. Thus our heavenly Father, who knows what his children need, uses some as stewards to supply the wants of others, and can provide for them, even from the ends of the earth.</body></html>
