(cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-35.htm">Genesis 37:35</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> As to the quotation generally. St. Matthew applies Jeremiah's picture of Rachel, the mother of Joseph, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of Ephraim (and also Manasseh), which was the typical part of the northern kingdom, weeping over the destruction of her children by the Assyrians, to the weeping of the mothers in Bethlehem. This application was the more easy because, as Rachel's tomb was near Bethlehem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-19.htm">Genesis 35:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48.htm">Genesis 48</a>.7), she might be considered the figurative ancestress of the Bethlehe-mites as well as the physical ancestress of the Ephraimites. The fulfilment spoken of is thus not to be understood as implying that Jeremiah predicted the massacre at Bethlehem, but that in it his words received a new and deeper significance. It must, however, be added that, although Rachel's tomb is placed at Bethlehem, both by the direct statement of the present text of Genesis and by tradition, which may be traced at least as far back as A.D. , and is accepted by Jews, Christians, and Mohammedans, there are serious doubts whether <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2</a> does not definitely place it in the north of Benjamin, and whether <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a> does not accept this latter view (cf. for this question Delitzsch, on Genesis, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>) . In any case, St. Matthew adopts the statement of Genesis. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:13-15 Egypt had been a house of bondage to Israel, and particularly cruel to the infants of Israel; yet it is to be a place of refuge to the holy Child Jesus. God, when he pleases, can make the worst of places serve the best of purposes. This was a trial of the faith of Joseph and Mary. But their faith, being tried, was found firm. If we and our infants are at any time in trouble, let us remember the straits in which Christ was when an infant. 16-18 Herod killed all the male children, not only in Bethlehem, but in all the villages of that city. Unbridled wrath, armed with an unlawful power, often carries men to absurd cruelties. It was no unrighteous thing with God to permit this; every life is forfeited to his justice as soon as it begins. The diseases and deaths of little children are proofs of original sin. But the murder of these infants was their martyrdom. How early did persecution against Christ and his kingdom begin! Herod now thought that he had baffled the Old Testament prophecies, and the efforts of the wise men in finding Christ; but whatever crafty, cruel devices are in men's hearts, the counsel of the Lord shall stand.</body></html>
