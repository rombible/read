Everywhere throughout the East men were looking for the advent of a great king who was to rise from among the Jews. The expectation partly rested on such Messianic prophecies of Isaiah as Isaiah 9, 11, partly on the later predictions of Daniel 7. It had fermented in the minds of men, heathens as well as Jews, and would have led them to welcome Jesus as the Christ had He come in accordance with their expectations. As it was, He came precisely as they did <span class= "ital">not</span> expect Him, shattering their earthly hopes to pieces, and so they did not receive Him.<p><span class= "bld">We have seen his star in the east.</span>--Here again we enter on questions which we cannot answer. Was the star (as Kepler conjectured) natural--the conjuncture of the planets Jupiter and Saturn appearing as a single star of special brightness--or supernatural; visible to all beholders, or to the Magi only? Astronomy is against the first view, by showing that the planets at their nearest were divided by the apparent diameter of the moon. The last hypothesis introduces a fresh miracle without a shadow of authority from Scripture. We must be content to remain in ignorance. We know too little of the astrology of that period to determine what star might or might not seem to those who watched the heavens as the precursor of a great king. Any star (as <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> that which was connected with the birth of Caesar) might, under given rules of art, acquire a new significance. Stories, not necessarily legends, of the appearances of such stars gathered round the births of Alexander the Great and Mithridates as well as Caesar. The language of Balaam as to "the Star that was to rise out of Jacob" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm" title="I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not near: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.">Numbers 24:17</a>) implied the existence of such an association of thoughts then, and tended to perpetuate it. As late as the reign of Hadrian, the rebel chief who headed the insurrection of the Jews took the name of Bar-cochab, the "Son of a Star." Without building too much on uncertain <span class= "ital">data,</span> we may, however, at least believe that the "wise men" were Gentiles. They do not ask for "<span class= "ital">our</span> king," but for the king of the Jews; and yet, though Gentiles, they were sharers in the Messianic hopes of the Jews. They came to worship, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to do homage, as subjects of the new-born King. They were watchers of the signs of the heavens, and when they saw what they interpreted as the sign that the King had come, they undertook a four months' journey (if they came from Babylon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-9.htm" title="For on the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God on him.">Ezra 7:9</a>; more, if they came from Persia), partly, perhaps, led by the position of the star (though this is not stated), partly naturally making their way to Jerusalem, as certain to hear there some tidings of the Jewish King.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saying</span>. The inquiry was on their lips at the moment of their appearance. <span class="cmt_word">Where is?</span> Not "whether there is." The Magi show no signs of doubt. <span class="cmt_word">He that is born King of the Jews</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he that is born to be King of the Jews. Whether he <span class="accented">is</span> king from the very moment of his birth is not stated. The rendering of the Revised Version margin, "Where is the King of the Jews that is born?" would imply this. With either form the bystanders could hardly help contrasting him with their then ruler, who had acquired the kingship after years of conflict, and who was of foreign extraction. <span class="accented">King of the Jews.</span> Notice: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> This was, perhaps, Herod's exact title (ver. 1, note). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> They do not say king of the world. They accept the facts that the Jews alone expected this king, and that according to the more literal interpretation of the Jewish prophecies the homage of the world would be rendered to him as the Head of the Jewish nation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The title is not used of our Lord again until the Passion, where it is only used by heathen (Pilate and the soldiers, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-11.htm">Matthew 27:11, 29, 37</a>, and parallel passages, Mark, Luke, John, and especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-21.htm">John 19:21</a>). The Magi and the Roman, learning and administration, East and West, acknowledge, at least in form, the King of the Jews. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The Jews themselves preferred the term, "King of Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-42.htm">Matthew 27:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-32.htm">Mark 15:32</a>, to which passages <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-37.htm">Luke 23:37</a>, placing the gibe in the soldiers' mouth, forms a significant contrast). The term "Jews" made them only one of the nations of the earth; "Israel" reminded them of their theocratic privileges. <span class="cmt_word">For</span>. They state the reason of their certainty. <span class="cmt_word">We have seen</span> ( <span class="accented">we saw</span>, Revised Version); at home. <span class="cmt_word">His</span> <span class="cmt_word">star</span>. In the way of their ordinary pursuits they learned of Christ. The observation of nature led them to nature's Bond (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>). What this star really was has been the subject of much consideration without any very satisfactory result. The principal theories are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It was the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter, which took place in May to July and again in September, <span class="date">B.C. 7</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It was the rising of Sirius on the same day in the fifth, fourth, third, and second years B.C. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> It was some strange evanescent star such as Kepler saw in 1603-4. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Astronomy can suggest nothing which satisfies all the conditions, and the appearance must have been strictly miraculous. Since Professor Pritchard's article in the 'Dictionary of the Bible,' this last has been generally accepted in England. A further question is - How came they to identify the star as "his"? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> What made the Magi connect the coming of the King of the Jews with a star? and what made them consider that this particular appearance was the one they expected? The latter part of the question can hardly be answered, except on the supposition that the star that they saw was in itself so extraordinary as to convince them that no greater star could be looked for. To the former part various answers have been given. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Balaam's prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>) was understood literally, and the knowledge of it, with its misinterpretation, had spread to the Magi. For this literal interpretation, cf. the 'Pesikta Zutarta' ('Lekah Tob') on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a> (p. 58, Venice edit.), where it says that in the fifth year of the heptad before Messiah "the star" shall shine forth from the east,, and this is the star of the Messiah (cf. also Edersheim, 'Life,' etc., 1:212). Similarly we find the false Messiah of the second century applying the term to himself - "Barcochab." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> They had learned, by intercourse with Jews (cf. the influence of the Jewish Sibylline oracles on the fourth eclogue), that these latter expected a great King, and they had applied to his coming, as to all events, the science that they themselves practised. They believed fully in astrology, and the Divine ordering that a star should appear to them was a condescension to the then state of human knowledge. <span class="cmt_word">In the East</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;</span>). Ellicott points out ('Hist. Lects.,' p. 73) that to translate this "at its rising" seems to be at needless variance with the use of the same words in ver. 9, where they seem to stand in a kind of <span class="accented">local</span> antithesis to "where the young Child was." For the phrase as referring to the Eastern part of the earth, cf. Clem. Romans, &sect; 5. It is more definite than the plural of ver. 1. <span class="cmt_word">And are come</span>. "We saw... and came" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) without delay. <span class="cmt_word">To Worship him</span>. Not as God, but as Lord and King (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-9.htm">Matthew 4:9</a>, note). The prostration of themselves bodily before him (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>; cf. also ver. 11) was not a Greek or Roman, but an Eastern, and it is said especially a Persian, form of homage. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 Those who live at the greatest distance from the means of grace often use most diligence, and learn to know the most of Christ and his salvation. But no curious arts, or mere human learning, can direct men unto him. We must learn of Christ by attending to the word of God, as a light that shineth in a dark place, and by seeking the teaching of the Holy Spirit. And those in whose hearts the day-star is risen, to give them any thing of the knowledge of Christ, make it their business to worship him. Though Herod was very old, and never had shown affection for his family, and was not himself likely to live till a new-born infant had grown up to manhood, he began to be troubled with the dread of a rival. He understood not the spiritual nature of the Messiah's kingdom. Let us beware of a dead faith. A man may be persuaded of many truths, and yet may hate them, because they interfere with his ambition, or sinful indulgences. Such a belief will make him uneasy, and the more resolved to oppose the truth and the cause of God; and he may be foolish enough to hope for success therein.</body></html>
