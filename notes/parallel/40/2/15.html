As the death of Herod took place a little before the Passover, B.C. 4 (according to the common but erroneous reckoning), it could not have been more than a few months, even if we fix the Nativity in the previous year.<p><span class= "bld">Out of Egypt have I called my son.</span>--As the words stand in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-1.htm" title="When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.">Hosea 11:1</a>, "When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt," they refer, beyond the shadow of a doubt, to the history of Israel, as being in a special sense, among all the nations of the world, the chosen son of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/4-22.htm" title="And you shall say to Pharaoh, Thus said the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:">Exodus 4:22-23</a>). It is hard to imagine any reader of the prophecy not seeing that this was what we should call <span class= "ital">the</span> meaning. But the train of thought which leads the Evangelist to apply it to the Christ has a distinct method of its own. A coincidence in what seems an accessory, a mere circumstance of the story, carries his mind on to some deeper analogies. In the days of the Exodus, Israel was the one representative instance of the Fatherhood of God manifested in protecting and delivering His people. Now there was a higher representative in the person of the only begotten Son. As the words "Out of Egypt did I call my Son" (he translated from the Hebrew instead of reproducing the Greek version of the LXX.) rose to his memory, what more natural than that mere context and historical meaning should be left unnoticed, and that he should note with wonder what a fulfilment they had found in the circumstances he had just narrated. Here, as before, the very seeming strain put upon the literal meaning of the words is presumptive evidence that the writer had before him the fact to which it had been adapted, rather than that the narrative was constructed, as some have thought, to support the strained interpretation of the prophecy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And was there until the death of Herod</span>.

"They acknowledged this people to be the son of God (<span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The quotation is, by the context, evidently adduced, not to prove the sonship of Jesus, but to enlarge upon the treatment that he received. The fundamental thought is that the experience of Messiah was parallel to the experience of the nation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The application of the term "my Son" to Messiah is justified by Jewish thought. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a> the nation was so called; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a> the head of the nation, the theocratic king, received the same title; much more could the great theocratic King, the Messiah, be so spoken cf. That, indeed, the name, "the Son of God," was used as a title of Messiahship by the Jews lacks direct evidence (cf. Stanton, 'The Jewish and the Christian Messiah,' 1886, p. 288), but is surely to be deduced from <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a> (16:16); cf. also the application of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a> to Messiah in Talm. Bab.,' Succah,' 52 a, in the late Midrash 'Tillim,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>, which traces" the decree" there spoken of through the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>), the prophets (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13</a>), and the Hagiographa (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>; for a paraphrase, cf. Edersheim, 'Life,' etc., App. 9.). It is hardly too much to say that no Jew could consistently, either in the early days of the Church or now, find any difficulty in St. Matthew's reference of the term "my Son" to Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> Seeing that St. Matthew's reference of the term "my Son" is justified by Jewish thought, and that the passage in Hosea is adduced to show that the experience of Messiah was parallel to that of the nation, there seems no real need to look for further reasons for the application. St. Matthew may hays held that Messiah was the Flower of Israel, so that what was predicated of Israel could be essentially explained of Messiah; he may have considered that Messiah was so organically connected with Israel that even when the nation was in Egypt Messiah was there also (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-10.htm">Hebrews 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-26.htm">Hebrews 11:26</a>); he may have thought that the pro-incarnate Son of God was always with his Church, and therefore with it even in Egypt; but of none of these theories have we any hint. The application of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1</a> to the early life of Christ belongs, we do not doubt, to the very earliest stage of Jewish Christian thought, and to defend it by modern subtleties of interpretation (sound though they may be in other connexions) seems quite out of place. Messiah was in some sense, as all Jews granted, the Son of God; Messiah, like the nation, went down into Egypt; what was predicated of the one was, clearly in this case, true of the other, and the prophet's words received a "fulfilment." The fulfilment was, indeed, what we should call a coincidence (cf. ver. 23, note), but to the pious mind, and especially to the pious mind of a Jew, coincidences are not chances, they are signs of the Divine Governor (cf. Bishop Westcott, 'Hebr.,' p. 481: 1889). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:13-15 Egypt had been a house of bondage to Israel, and particularly cruel to the infants of Israel; yet it is to be a place of refuge to the holy Child Jesus. God, when he pleases, can make the worst of places serve the best of purposes. This was a trial of the faith of Joseph and Mary. But their faith, being tried, was found firm. If we and our infants are at any time in trouble, let us remember the straits in which Christ was when an infant. 16-18 Herod killed all the male children, not only in Bethlehem, but in all the villages of that city. Unbridled wrath, armed with an unlawful power, often carries men to absurd cruelties. It was no unrighteous thing with God to permit this; every life is forfeited to his justice as soon as it begins. The diseases and deaths of little children are proofs of original sin. But the murder of these infants was their martyrdom. How early did persecution against Christ and his kingdom begin! Herod now thought that he had baffled the Old Testament prophecies, and the efforts of the wise men in finding Christ; but whatever crafty, cruel devices are in men's hearts, the counsel of the Lord shall stand.</body></html>
