This in part explains the fact that he does not give either the version of the LXX., or a more accurate rendering of the Hebrew, but a free paraphrase. As the Targum, just referred to, belongs to this period, it is perfectly possible that the writer of it may have been one of the Council. At any rate, his Messianic reference of the passage was likely to be dominant. The chief difference for the English reader to note is, that the Hebrew gives "thou art little among the thousands (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-15.htm" title="And he said to him, Oh my Lord, with which shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.">Judges 6:15</a>, the families or clans) of Judah;" the version given by St. Matthew, "thou art not the least among the princes." The prophet contrasts the outward insignificance with the spiritual greatness. The paraphrast sees the outward transfigured by the glory of the spiritual. So again the simpler "out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel" is paraphrased into "out of thee shall come a Governor that shall rule (<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> feed, as a shepherd) my people Israel." The fact that the scribes stopped, and did not go on to the words that told of the Ruler as one "whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting," may have arisen either from an unwillingness to bring that aspect of the expected Christ before the mind of Herod, or, possibly, from an equal unwillingness to face it themselves.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Jude, art not the least among the princes</span> <span class="cmt_word">of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel;</span> <span class="accented">and thou Bethlehem</span>, <span class="accented">land of Judah</span>, <span class="accented">art in no wise least among the princes of Judah</span>: <span class="accented">For out of thee shall come forth a governor</span>, <span class="accented">which shall be shepherd of my people Israel</span> (Revised Version). In this quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a> notice the following Variations from the Hebrew, and practically from the LXX.: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "Land of Judah" for "Ephratah"; an unimportant change in the terms of definition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "Art in no wise least" for "which art little to be "; a verbal contradiction probably, but also unimportant, as the thought of the context in Micah is of Bethlehem's greatness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "Princes" for "thousands." This may be due <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> to a different pointing of the Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bb;&#x5e4;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> (cf. the rabbinic commentary, 'Metzud. Zion.'), or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> to understanding <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> as "families" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-15.htm">Judges 6:15</a>; cf. Revised 'Version margin), and then concentrating the family in its head. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> "For out of thee shall come forth a governor, which shall be shepherd of my people Israel" for "out of thee shall one come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel." This is a paraphrase, with a paraphrastic addition from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a> (7:7), in order to distinctly identify the ruler with Messiah. Nothing is commoner in Jewish authors than the silent conjunction of quotations from separate contexts. In this case the thought of the shepherd in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4</a> made the addition from Samuel the more easy. It must also be noticed that the reference of the passage in Micah to Christ is fully borne out by Jewish writers. Though they generally explain the rest of the verse as referring to the long lapse of time from David himself, they understand the ruler to be Messiah. But it is not usual with Jewish interpreters to understand the reference to Bethlehem as implying the place of Messiah's own birth. They generally take it as referring to the home of David, Messiah's ancestor. And this is the more natural meaning of the prophecy. The quotation, however, from the Jerusalem Talmud already given on ver. 1, and the Targum of Jonathan on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-21.htm">Genesis 35:21</a> ("the tower of Edar - the place whence King Messiah is about to be revealed in the end of the days"), endorse the thoroughly Jewish character of the reply given to Herod (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-42.htm">John 7:42</a>). If it be asked why St. Matthew does not give an exact and verbal rendering of the Hebrew, the answer may be made that he probably gives the current form of its exposition. The high priests and scribes would have doubtless quoted it accurately <span class="accented">in the process</span> of weighing Micah's statement, but when, as here, they were only reproducing the result that they had arrived at, they would care for only the substance of the prophet's teaching (cf. the paraphrastic rendering of the Targum). <span class="accented">In the land of Judah</span>; Revised Version omits <span class="accented">in</span> ( <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f72;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>). "Bethlehem-Judah" would have presented no difficulty, for a town was often distinguished by the apposition of the name of the district in which it was situated; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Ramoth-Gilead, Kedesh-Naphtali. It seems best to explain the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;</span> as a mere expansion of "Judah" (cf. 1 Macc. 5:68, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, where probably the thought was Ashdod-Philistia). It is, however, possible that <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;</span> is here used in the sense of "the town and its surrounding district, over which district, it is to be observed, Herod extended his massacre (verse 16)" (Humphrey, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 Those who live at the greatest distance from the means of grace often use most diligence, and learn to know the most of Christ and his salvation. But no curious arts, or mere human learning, can direct men unto him. We must learn of Christ by attending to the word of God, as a light that shineth in a dark place, and by seeking the teaching of the Holy Spirit. And those in whose hearts the day-star is risen, to give them any thing of the knowledge of Christ, make it their business to worship him. Though Herod was very old, and never had shown affection for his family, and was not himself likely to live till a new-born infant had grown up to manhood, he began to be troubled with the dread of a rival. He understood not the spiritual nature of the Messiah's kingdom. Let us beware of a dead faith. A man may be persuaded of many truths, and yet may hate them, because they interfere with his ambition, or sinful indulgences. Such a belief will make him uneasy, and the more resolved to oppose the truth and the cause of God; and he may be foolish enough to hope for success therein.</body></html>
