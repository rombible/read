Antipas had Galilee and Peraea, Philip the region of Trachonitis. Popularly, however, the higher title was still used of him as we find it in 14:9 of the Tetrarch Antipas. The character of Archelaus was as cruel and treacherous as that of his father, and within a few months after his accession, he sent in his horsemen to disperse a multitude, and slew not less than 3,000 men. The temper of Antipas on the other hand was as yet looked on as milder. This, and possibly his absence from Galilee on a visit to Rome, may well have led Joseph to turn to that region as offering a prospect of greater safety (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xvii. 2, 5, 6, 8, 9). Nine years later the oppression of Archelaus became so intolerable that both Jews and Samaritans complained of him to the Emperor, and he was deposed and banished to Gaul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But when he heard that Archelaus</span>. Until his murder five days before Herod's own death in the spring of A.U.C. 750, Antipater, Herod's eldest son, might naturally have been regarded as the successor, though in fact Antipas had been named as such in the will. But after Antipater's death Herod altered his will; and appointing Antipas Tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea, and Philip Tetrarch of Gaulonitis, Traehonitis, and Paneas, he granted the kingdom to Archelaus. Further, even after Herod's death, the succession was far from certain until the consent of Augustus had been obtained, and this, in fact, was jeopardized by Archelaus's massacre of three thousand cf those who, on his accession, called for justice on the agents of the barbarities of the late reign. Eventually, however, Herod's last arrangement was practically confirmed by Augustus, save that he expressly gave Archelaus, who had hastened to Rome, but half of his father's dominion, and appointed him only ethnarch, promising to make him king "if he governed that part virtuously" (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 17:08. 1; 11. 4; cf. 'Bell. Jud.,' 1:33. 8; 2:7. 3). Joseph's fear of Archelaus quite corresponds to the character given of him by the Jewish ambassadors before Augustus. "He seemed to be afraid lest he should not be deemed Herod's own son; and so, without any delay, he immediately Jet the nation understand his meaning," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by the slaughter of the three thousand malcontents above referred to (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 17:11.2). He was in A.D. deposed for his cruelty, and banished to Vienne, in Gaul. <span class="cmt_word">Did reign</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">was reigning</span>; an attempt to express the vivid present of the original, which recalls the very words he heard. After Augustus's decision, Archelaus could not legally have called himself <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, but the title, especially as implied in the verb, would have been customary in popular speech (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-9.htm">Matthew 14:9</a>). But it is possible that the expression was used before Archelaus went to Rome, and at the time of his first grasp of power under Herod's will. <span class="cmt_word">In Judaea</span>. The Revised Version ( <span class="accented">over Judaea</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) rightly implies not only that he lived in Judaea, but that, unlike his father, was not king of the whole of Palestine, but emphatically of Judaea. To this Idumaea and Samaria were appendages. <span class="cmt_word">In the room of his father Herod</span>. Had St. Matthew the same thought as the Jewish ambassadors above? <span class="cmt_word">He was afraid to go thither;</span> and presumably he told God his fears. <span class="cmt_word">Notwithstanding</span> (only <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>); Revised Version, <span class="accented">and. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Being warned of God</span> (ver. 12, note).

Christ was sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, to them he must return. Did we but look upon the world as our Egypt, the place of our bondage and banishment, and heaven only as our Canaan, our home, our rest, we should as readily arise and depart thither, when we are called for, as Joseph did out of Egypt. The family must settle in Galilee. Nazareth was a place held in bad esteem, and Christ was crucified with this accusation, Jesus the Nazarene. Wherever Providence allots the bounds of our habitation, we must expect to share the reproach of Christ; yet we may glory in being called by his name, sure that if we suffer with him, we shall also be glorified with him.</body></html>
