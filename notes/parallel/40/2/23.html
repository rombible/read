Here it will be enough to deal with St. Matthew's reference to the name as in itself the fulfilment of a prophetic thought. He does not, as before, cite the words of any one prophet by name, but says generally that what he quotes had been spoken by or through the prophets. No such words are to be found in the Old Testament. It is not likely that the Evangelist would have quoted from any apocryphal prophecy, nor is there any trace of the existence of such a prophecy. The true explanation is to be found in the impression made on his mind by the verbal coincidence of fact with prediction. He had heard men speak with scorn of "the Nazarene," and yet the very syllables of that word had also fallen on his ears in one of the most glorious of the prophecies admitted to be Messianic--"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a <span class= "ital">Netzer</span> (Branch) shall grow out of his roots" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1</a>). So he found in the word of scorn the <span class= "ital">nomen et omen</span> of glory. The town of Nazareth probably took its name from this meaning of the word, as pointing, like our <span class= "ital">-hurst</span> and <span class= "ital">-holt,</span> to the trees and shrubs for which it was conspicuous. The general reference to the prophets is explained by the fact that the same thought is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-15.htm" title="In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up to David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.">Jeremiah 33:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-8.htm" title="Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you, and your fellows that sit before you: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.">Zechariah 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm" title="And speak to him, saying, Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:">Zechariah 6:12</a>, though there the Hebrew word is <span class= "ital">Zemach,</span> and not <span class= "ital">Netzer.</span> A like train of thought is found in the language of Tertullian and other early Christian writers to their heathen opponents--"You call us Christians," they say," worshippers of Christos, but you pronounce the words <span class= "ital">Chrestiani</span> and <span class= "ital">Chrestos, i.e.,</span> you give us a name which in your own language (Greek) means 'good,' and so you unconsciously bear testimony to the life we really lead." This seems the only tenable explanation of the passage. It is hardly likely that the Evangelist should have referred to the scorn with which Nazareth was regarded. Any reference to the Nazarite vow is out of the question, (1) because the two words are spelt differently, both in Greek and Hebrew, and (2) because our Lord's life represented quite a different aspect of holiness from that of which the Nazarite vow was the expression. That vow, as seen pre-eminently in the Baptist, represented the consecration which consists in separation from the world. The life of Christ manifested the higher form of consecration which is found in being <span class= "ital">in</span> the world but not <span class= "ital">of</span> it, mingling with the men and women who compose it, in order to purify and save.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth</span>. <span class="accented">En-Nasira</span>, now of from five thousand to six thousand souls, in the hills on the northern edge of the Plain of Esdraelon, not mentioned in the Old Testament or by Josephus.

Thus the reference to the prophets requires that they speak of Messiah by some term belonging to this root, and not to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">nzr</span>). What this term is may be gathered from the true text of Talm. Bab., 'Sanh.,' 43a (cf. 'Levy,' <span class="accented">s.v.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e6;&#x5e8;</span>, and for the passage in full, Rabbinowicz, 'Var. Leer.'), where, after enumerating five disciples of Jesus the Nazarene (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5e6;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;</span>), among them Netzer, a summary is given of their trial and condemnation. Of Netzer it is said, "They brought Netzer up for trial. He said to the judges, Shall Netzer be slain? It is written, 'A branch (<span class="accented">netzer</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e6;&#x5e8;</span>) out of his roots shall bear fruit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>).'They answered him, Yea, Netzer shall be slain. For it is written, 'But thou art cast forth away from thy sepulchre like an abominable branch'" (<span class="accented">netzer</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>). It does not now concern us to inquire which, if any, of the twelve disciples is here spoken of by the name of Netzer. But it is evident that the Jews <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> connected this name closely with Jesus the Nazarene just before mentioned, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> saw a connexion between it and "the Branch" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>. True that they rejected the disciple's application of the passage, but they did not reject the identity of the expressions. The application which was made, even according to the Talmud, is fully expressed by the evangelist here. There, as we may see if we read between the lines, the disciple claimed for his Christianity that it corresponded to the promise of Isaiah; here the evangelist more definitely claims a correspondence between that promise and Jesus. He is not concerned with deeper points of similarity, though they could not fail to suggest themselves both to him and to his readers, but merely notices that the very dwelling-place of Jesus answers to the promise of Messiah. <span class="accented">Netzer</span> he was to be; the Divine working brought it about that this, though in adjectival form, was his common appellation. Observe that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to <span class="accented">netzer</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a> the word <span class="accented">tsemah</span>, corresponds in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the fulfilment consists, not in carrying out a definite statement to its logical issue in history, but in the existence of a strange correspondence which implies Divine foresight and arrangement. Why Joseph settled at Nazareth rather than at any other spot in Galilee, St. Matthew gives no hint. The reason is found in the fact recorded by St. Luke that Mary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26</a>) and Joseph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-4.htm">Luke 2:4</a>) had lived there before the Birth. It is true that St. Matthew's account taken alone gives the impression that this was not the case, but the impression is not so strong as to warrant even the assertion that St. Matthew was ignorant of the earlier residence, much less that his account in fact contradicts St. Luke's. The mutual independence and the general trustworthiness of the two accounts of the Birth and Infancy is shown by the fact that in their less important details they cannot always be reconciled. (On our present difficulties in arranging the events recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-2.htm">Matthew 1:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-2.htm">Luke 1:2</a>, cf. Ellicott, 'Lects.,' p. 70; Godet, 'Luke,' transl., 1. pp. 153-156.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:19-23 Egypt may serve to sojourn in, or take shelter in, for awhile, but not to abide in. Christ was sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, to them he must return. Did we but look upon the world as our Egypt, the place of our bondage and banishment, and heaven only as our Canaan, our home, our rest, we should as readily arise and depart thither, when we are called for, as Joseph did out of Egypt. The family must settle in Galilee. Nazareth was a place held in bad esteem, and Christ was crucified with this accusation, Jesus the Nazarene. Wherever Providence allots the bounds of our habitation, we must expect to share the reproach of Christ; yet we may glory in being called by his name, sure that if we suffer with him, we shall also be glorified with him.</body></html>
