In a narrative of common life the natural expression would have been "his wife and the young child."<p><span class= "bld">And departed into Egypt.</span>--The brevity with which this is told is, to a certain extent, an argument for the non-mythical character of the narrative of which it forms a part. The legends of the Apocryphal Gospels, embodied in many forms of poetry and art, show how easily, in later times, the fabulous element crystallised round the Gospel nucleus of fact. The idols of Egypt bowed or fell down before the divine child; a well sprung up under the palm-tree that gave the traveller shelter. They were attacked by robbers, and owed their preservation to the pity of Dismas, one of the band, who was afterwards the penitent thief of the crucifixion. How far the journey extended we cannot tell. It would have been enough for Joseph's object to pass the so-called River of Egypt, which separated that country from the region under Herod's sovereignty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he arose, he took</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">and he arose and took.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> here, as in ver. 13, precludes delay. <span class="cmt_word">The young Child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt</span>. As St. Paul in after years was able to connect himself with fellow-craftsmen, and thus maintain himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-3.htm">Acts 18:3</a>), so might Joseph reasonably expect to be able to do in Egypt, and the more so since the connexion there between those who worked at the same trade seems to have been even closer than elsewhere, for in the great synagogue at Alexandria they sat together, "so that if a stranger came he could join himself to his fellow-craftsmen and, through their means, obtain his livelihood" (Talm. Jeremiah, 'Suecah,' 5:1, p. 55, d). Jewish reference to our Lord's stay in Egypt are to be found in the blasphemous tables of his having brought thence his knowledge of magic (cf. Laible, in 'Nathanael,' 1890, p. 79). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:13-15 Egypt had been a house of bondage to Israel, and particularly cruel to the infants of Israel; yet it is to be a place of refuge to the holy Child Jesus. God, when he pleases, can make the worst of places serve the best of purposes. This was a trial of the faith of Joseph and Mary. But their faith, being tried, was found firm. If we and our infants are at any time in trouble, let us remember the straits in which Christ was when an infant. 16-18 Herod killed all the male children, not only in Bethlehem, but in all the villages of that city. Unbridled wrath, armed with an unlawful power, often carries men to absurd cruelties. It was no unrighteous thing with God to permit this; every life is forfeited to his justice as soon as it begins. The diseases and deaths of little children are proofs of original sin. But the murder of these infants was their martyrdom. How early did persecution against Christ and his kingdom begin! Herod now thought that he had baffled the Old Testament prophecies, and the efforts of the wise men in finding Christ; but whatever crafty, cruel devices are in men's hearts, the counsel of the Lord shall stand.</body></html>
