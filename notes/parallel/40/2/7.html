Secrecy was doubly necessary. He would not publicly commit himself to acknowledging the rights of the new King, and he would give no opportunity for others to warn the Child's parents of the dangerous interest that Herod was taking in him. Duplicity was very characteristic of Herod; cf. his assassination of Aristobulus the high priest (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 15:03. 3), and his alluring his son Antipater home to death (ibid., 17:5. 1). <span class="cmt_word">Inquired of them diligently</span>; <span class="accented">learned of them carefully</span> (Revised Version); "lerned of hem bisili" (Wickliffe); <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. The stress is not upon Herod's careful questioning, but on the exact information that he obtained. <span class="cmt_word">What time the star appeared</span>. Although this is not the literal translation, it may, perhaps, represent the sense of the original ( <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) , the participle characterizing the star in its most important relation - its appearance, and the words being treated as a compound expression (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-9.htm">John 12:9, 12</a>). Herod supposed that the birth of the Babe was synchronous with the first appearance of the star. The translation, however, of the Revised Version margin, "the time of the star that appeared," better suits the exact wording ( <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>;<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) , the phrase thus including both the first appearance and also the period of continuance (cf. Grotius, "non initium, sed continuitas"). But it is difficult to see What Herod would have learned from this latter particular. Some even think that the star was still visible (Plumptre; Weiss, 'Matthew'), but in this case the joy of the Magi in ver. 10 is not satisfactorily explained. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 Those who live at the greatest distance from the means of grace often use most diligence, and learn to know the most of Christ and his salvation. But no curious arts, or mere human learning, can direct men unto him. We must learn of Christ by attending to the word of God, as a light that shineth in a dark place, and by seeking the teaching of the Holy Spirit. And those in whose hearts the day-star is risen, to give them any thing of the knowledge of Christ, make it their business to worship him. Though Herod was very old, and never had shown affection for his family, and was not himself likely to live till a new-born infant had grown up to manhood, he began to be troubled with the dread of a rival. He understood not the spiritual nature of the Messiah's kingdom. Let us beware of a dead faith. A man may be persuaded of many truths, and yet may hate them, because they interfere with his ambition, or sinful indulgences. Such a belief will make him uneasy, and the more resolved to oppose the truth and the cause of God; and he may be foolish enough to hope for success therein.</body></html>
