The expectations that connected Bethlehem with the coming of the Christ might naturally lead them to remain there at least for a season,<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When they had heard the king</span>. There is a slight contrast in the Greek, <span class="accented">but they</span> [<span class="accented">for their part</span>] <span class="accented">having heard the King. <span class="cmt_word"></span>They departed</span>; <span class="accented">went their way</span> (Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">Took their journey</span> ( <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And lo, the star, which they saw in the East</span>. They would, in accordance with Eastern custom, probably travel by night. Observe that the joy they felt at seeing the star (ver. 10) implies that it had not continued visible (ver. 7, note). They had fully used all means; now they receive fresh Divine guidance. <span class="accented">In the East</span> (ver. 2, note). <span class="cmt_word">Went before them</span>. Continuously ( <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fc6;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); "taking them by the hand and drawing them on" (Chrysostom). Not to show them the way to Bethlehem, for the road was easy, but to assure them of guidance to the Babe, over whose temporary home it stayed. The road to Bethlehem is, and from the nature of the valley must always have been, so nearly straight (until the last half-mile, when there is a sudden turn up the hill) that the star need have moved but slightly. Bethlehem itself is seen soon after passing Mar Elias, a monastery rather more than half-way from Jerusalem (Socin's 'Baedeker,' p. 242). <span class="cmt_word">Till it came and stood over where the young Child was</span>. Does the true reading ( <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>) suggest the unseen hand by which this star was itself guided and stationed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-11.htm">Matthew 27:11</a>)? or is it used with a kind of reflexive force, indicating that it was by no chance that it stood still there - "took its stand" (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-11.htm">Luke 18:11, 40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-14.htm">Acts 2:14</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3</a>; 12:18)? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:9-12 What joy these wise men felt upon this sight of the star, none know so well as those who, after a long and melancholy night of temptation and desertion, under the power of a spirit of bondage, at length receive the Spirit of adoption, witnessing with their spirits that they are the children of God. We may well think what a disappointment it was to them, when they found a cottage was his palace, and his own poor mother the only attendant he had. However, these wise men did not think themselves baffled; but having found the King they sought, they presented their gifts to him. The humble inquirer after Christ will not be stumbled at finding him and his disciples in obscure cottages, after having in vain sought them in palaces and populous cities. Is a soul busy, seeking after Christ? Would it worship him, and does it say, Alas! I am a foolish and poor creature, and have nothing to offer? Nothing! Hast thou not a heart, though unworthy of him, dark, hard, and foul? Give it to him as it is, and be willing that he use and dispose of it as it pleases him; he will take it, and will make it better, and thou shalt never repent having given it to him. He shall frame it to his own likeness, and will give thee himself, and be thine for ever. The gifts the wise men presented were gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Providence sent these as a seasonable relief to Joseph and Mary in their present poor condition. Thus our heavenly Father, who knows what his children need, uses some as stewards to supply the wants of others, and can provide for them, even from the ends of the earth.</body></html>
