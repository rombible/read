It is admitted, however, on all hands, that it was an act every way in harmony with Herod's character. Tormented with incurable disease, and yet more incurable suspicion; so fiendish in his cruelty, that he gave orders for the execution of many of the leading men of Judaea immediately upon his own death, that there might at least be some genuine mourning at his funeral; making fresh wills, according to the passing passion of the moment; adding, as his last act, the death of yet another son, Antipater, to those of the two sons of Mariamne (so that Augustus was reported to have said that it was better to be "Herod's swine than son"),--it might well be that he gave such a command as this among the cruel and reckless acts of the last months of his life. Nor need we wonder that the act was not recorded elsewhere. The population of Bethlehem could hardly have been more than 2,000, and the number of children under two years of age in that number would be between twenty and thirty. The cruelty of such an act would naturally impress itself on the local memory, from which, directly or indirectly, the Gospel record was derived, and yet escape the notice of an historian writing eighty or ninety years afterwards of the wars and court history of the period. The secrecy which marked the earlier part of Herod's scheme (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-7.htm" title="Then Herod, when he had privately called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.">Matthew 2:7</a>) would extend naturally, as far as Jerusalem was concerned, to its execution.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-18.</span> <span class="accented">- The slaughter of the innocents.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>). The verb which in the New Testament occurs only in the synoptists, and always in the strict sense of "mock" ( <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-29.htm">Matthew 27:29, 31, 41</a>), represents Herod's feelings, and perhaps his language, at his treatment by the Magi. It was more than deception; they had trifled with him. <span class="cmt_word">Of the Wise Men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children</span>; Revised Version, male <span class="accented">children</span> ( <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">That were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts</span> (Revised Version, <span class="accented">borders</span>) thereof. Not merely the districts legally belonging to the city, but the neighbourhood generally. <span class="cmt_word">From two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired</span> (ver. 7, note) <span class="cmt_word">of the Wise Men</span>. Had he made further inquiries, he might have aroused suspicion, so he made sure of his prey by allowing a wide margin both in time and space. "'On Augustus being informed,' says Macrobius ['Saturn.,' 2:4], 'that among the boys under two years of age whom Herod ordered to be slain in Syria, his own son also lind been slain, "It is better," said he, "to be Herod's pig (<span class="greek">&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>) than his son (<span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>)." Although Macrobius is a late writer [circ. 400]. and made the mistake of supposing that Herod's son Antipater, who was put to death about the same time as the massacre of the innocents, had actually perished in that massacre, it is clear that the form in which he narrates the <span class="accented">bon</span> <span class="accented">mot</span> of Augustus points to some dim reminiscence of this cruel slaughter" (Farrar, 'Life,' etc., p. 34, illust. edit.; cf. also Ellicott, 'Lectures,' p. 78). Farrar (and Edersheim accepts his calculation) reckons that not more than twenty children were killed. Thus failed the first attempt to destroy Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-4.htm">Revelation 12:4</a> (Nosgen). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:13-15 Egypt had been a house of bondage to Israel, and particularly cruel to the infants of Israel; yet it is to be a place of refuge to the holy Child Jesus. God, when he pleases, can make the worst of places serve the best of purposes. This was a trial of the faith of Joseph and Mary. But their faith, being tried, was found firm. If we and our infants are at any time in trouble, let us remember the straits in which Christ was when an infant. 16-18 Herod killed all the male children, not only in Bethlehem, but in all the villages of that city. Unbridled wrath, armed with an unlawful power, often carries men to absurd cruelties. It was no unrighteous thing with God to permit this; every life is forfeited to his justice as soon as it begins. The diseases and deaths of little children are proofs of original sin. But the murder of these infants was their martyrdom. How early did persecution against Christ and his kingdom begin! Herod now thought that he had baffled the Old Testament prophecies, and the efforts of the wise men in finding Christ; but whatever crafty, cruel devices are in men's hearts, the counsel of the Lord shall stand.</body></html>
