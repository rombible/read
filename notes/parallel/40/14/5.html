There was yet a struggle of conscience against passion in the weak and wicked tetrarch, as there was in Ahab in his relations with Elijah. In Herodias, as in Jezebel, there was no halting between two opinions, and she, in the bitterness of her hate, thirsted for the blood of the prophet who had dared to rebuke her guilt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he would have put him</span> <span class="cmt_word">to death, he feared the multitude</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-6.htm">Luke 20:6</a>). Mark has, "And Herodias set herself against him, <span class="accented">and would have put him to death</span>; and she could not; for Herod <span class="accented">feared</span> John." The more detailed account in Mark is doubtless the more exact. Perhaps the facts of the case were that, in the first heat of his resentment, Herod wished to kill John, but feared the anger of the people, and that afterwards, when he him in his power and Herodias still urged his death, Herod had himself learned to respect him. Observe <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that it is quite impossible to suppose that either evangelist had the words of the other in front of him. The difference does not consist merely of addition or explanation; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that these are exactly the kind of verbal coincidences which might be expected to be found in two oral traditions starting from a common basis. <span class="cmt_word">For they counted him as a</span> <span class="cmt_word">prophet</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); so <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-26.htm">Matthew 21:26</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-46.htm">Matthew 21:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-32.htm">Mark 11:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-29.htm">Philippians 2:29</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-12 The terror and reproach of conscience, which Herod, like other daring offenders, could not shake off, are proofs and warnings of a future judgment, and of future misery to them. But there may be the terror of convictions, where there is not the truth of conversion. When men pretend to favour the gospel, yet live in evil, we must not favour their self-delusion, but must deliver our consciences as John did. The world may call this rudeness and blind zeal. False professors, or timid Christians, may censure it as want of civility; but the most powerful enemies can go no further than the Lord sees good to permit. Herod feared that the putting of John to death might raise a rebellion among the people, which it did not; but he never feared it might stir up his own conscience against him, which it did. Men fear being hanged for what they do not fear being damned for. And times of carnal mirth and jollity are convenient times for carrying on bad designs against God's people. Herod would profusely reward a worthless dance, while imprisonment and death were the recompence of the man of God who sought the salvation of his soul. But there was real malice to John beneath his consent, or else Herod would have found ways to get clear of his promise. When the under shepherds are smitten, the sheep need not be scattered while they have the Great Shepherd to go to. And it is better to be drawn to Christ by want and loss, than not to come to him at all.</body></html>
