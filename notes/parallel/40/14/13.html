This was, indeed, sufficiently shown by the eagerness with which the people followed Him into His retirement. Two other circumstances, named by the other Evangelists, tended to increase the crowd that thronged around Him. (1) The Twelve had just returned from their missionary circuit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/6-30.htm" title="And the apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.">Mark 6:30-31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-10.htm" title="And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.">Luke 9:10</a>), and it was, indeed, partly to give them, too, an interval of repose that He thus withdrew from His public work; and (2) the Passover was coming on (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-4.htm" title="And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.">John 6:4</a>), and all the roads of Galilee were thronged with companies of pilgrims hastening to keep the feast at Jerusalem.<p><span class= "bld">Into a desert place.</span>--St. Luke names this as "a city called Bethsaida," i.e., one of the two towns bearing that name on the coast of the Sea of Galilee. The name (which signified House of Fish=Fish-town) was a natural one for villages so placed, and the topography of all countries, our own included, presents too many instances of two or more places bearing the same name. with some distinctive epithet, to make the fact at all strange here. In St. Mark's account the disciples sail, after the feeding of the five thousand, to the other Bethsaida (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-45.htm" title="And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before to Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.">Mark 6:45</a>); and as this appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-17.htm" title="And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.">John 6:17</a> to have been in the direction of Capernaum, the scene of the miracle must have been Bethsaida-Julias. on the north-east shore of the lake.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-21.</span> - <span class="accented">The feeding of the five thousand.</span> Parallel passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-30.htm">Mark 6:30-44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-10.htm">Luke 9:10-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-1.htm">John 6:1-13</a>. The miracle was deemed so characteristic of our Lord's work, in his care for men and his power to sustain them, and more especially in its being a parable of his readiness to supply spiritual food, that it was recorded not only by each of the three evangelists who used the framework, but also by the one who depended entirely upon his own materials. But though St. John's account of it is on the whole independent, yet even this has expressions which are certainly due to the influence of the source used by the synoptists, or, less probably, of one or other of our present Gospels. The evangelist relates <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the occasion of the miracle (vers. 13, 140; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the preparation of the disciples (vers. 15-18); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the miracle itself (vers. 19, 20); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> a summary statement of the numbers fed (ver. 21). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Jesus heard of it</span> (cf. ver. 12<span class="accented">b</span>, note), <span class="cmt_word">he departed.</span> (For the form of the sentence, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-15.htm">Matthew 12:15</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Thence by ship;</span> <span class="accented">in a boat</span> (Revised Version); <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-23.htm">Matthew 8:23</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Into a desert place apart.</span> Defined in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-3.htm">John 6:3</a> as "the mountain;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-10.htm">Luke 9:10</a> as "a city called Bethsaida." The spot appears to have been in part of the plain <span class="accented">El-Batiha</span>, which is at the northcast corner of the Sea of Galilee on the Gaulonitis side of the Jordan, and in which stood Bethsaida-Julias. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-45.htm">Mark 6:45</a> implies that there was a second Bethsaida on the western side of the lake, which, though not alluded to by Josephus, is expressly spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-21.htm">John 12:21</a>, and is probably referred to in all the other passages of the New Testament where the name Bethsaida occurs. <span class="cmt_word">And when the people</span> (<span class="accented">the multitudes</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.</span> The fact that it was near a feast time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-4.htm">John 6:4</a>, the Passover, if the text be right; and cf. <span class="accented">infra</span>, ver. 19, note) perhaps accounts for the multitudes being so large. Some at least would be on their way up to Jerusalem. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:13-21 When Christ and his word withdraw, it is best for us to follow, seeking the means of grace for our souls before any worldly advantages. The presence of Christ and his gospel, makes a desert not only tolerable, but desirable. This little supply of bread was increased by Christ's creating power, till the whole multitude were satisfied. In seeking the welfare of men's souls, we should have compassion on their bodies likewise. Let us also remember always to crave a blessing on our meals, and learn to avoid all waste, as frugality is the proper source of liberality. See in this miracle an emblem of the Bread of life, which came down from heaven to sustain our perishing souls. The provisions of Christ's gospel appear mean and scanty to the world, yet they satisfy all that feed on him in their hearts by faith with thanksgiving.</body></html>
