The policy of the tetrarch connected him with the Sadducean priestly party rather than with the more popular and rigid Pharisees, and a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-6.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.">Matthew 16:6</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-15.htm" title="And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.">Mark 8:15</a> at least suggests the identity of the "leaven of Herod" with that of the Sadducees. On this supposition, his acceptance of the first of the three rumours is every way remarkable. The superstitious terror of a conscience stained with guilt is stronger than his scepticism as a Sadducee, even though there mingled with it, as was probable enough, the wider unbelief of Roman epicureanism. To him the new Prophet, working signs and wonders which John had never worked, was but the re-appearance of the man whom he had murdered. It was more than a spectre from the unseen world, more than the metempsychosis of the soul of John into another body. It was nothing less than John himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And said unto his servants.</span> According to Luke, the following assertion was brought forward by some, but was, it would seem, summarily rejected by Herod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-7.htm">Luke 9:7, 9</a>); according to Mark (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, Westcott and Hort, <span class="accented">text</span>) it was common talk, and agreed to by Herod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-14.htm">Mark 6:14, 16</a>). If a reconciliation of so unimportant a verbal disagreement be sought for, it may perhaps lie in Luke representing Herod's first exclamation, and Matthew, with Mark, his settled belief. Clearly Herod did not originate it, as the summary account in our Gospel would lead us to suppose. <span class="cmt_word">This is John the Baptist</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1</a> and Matthew 4:12, notes).

Plumptre, on Mark, adduces a curious passage from Persius, 5:180-188, which he thinks is based on a story that when Herod celebrated another of his birthdays (cf. ver. 6) in Rome, in A.D. , he was terrified by a Banquo-like appearance of the murdered prophet. The superstition that already suggested to Herod the resurrection of John might well act more strongly on the anniversary of the murder, and after he had connived at the death of the One who, by his miracles, showed that he possessed greater power than John. <span class="cmt_word">And therefore</span>; "because he is no ordinary man, but one risen from the dead" (Meyer). <span class="cmt_word">Mighty works do show forth themselves in him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>) <span class="accented">do these powers work in him</span> (Revised Version).

Observe that this passage confirms the statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-41.htm">John 10:41</a>, that John performed no miracle. Observe that it is also an indirect witness to the fact of our Lord performing miracles. For Herod's utterance is not such as a forger would have imagined. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-12 The terror and reproach of conscience, which Herod, like other daring offenders, could not shake off, are proofs and warnings of a future judgment, and of future misery to them. But there may be the terror of convictions, where there is not the truth of conversion. When men pretend to favour the gospel, yet live in evil, we must not favour their self-delusion, but must deliver our consciences as John did. The world may call this rudeness and blind zeal. False professors, or timid Christians, may censure it as want of civility; but the most powerful enemies can go no further than the Lord sees good to permit. Herod feared that the putting of John to death might raise a rebellion among the people, which it did not; but he never feared it might stir up his own conscience against him, which it did. Men fear being hanged for what they do not fear being damned for. And times of carnal mirth and jollity are convenient times for carrying on bad designs against God's people. Herod would profusely reward a worthless dance, while imprisonment and death were the recompence of the man of God who sought the salvation of his soul. But there was real malice to John beneath his consent, or else Herod would have found ways to get clear of his promise. When the under shepherds are smitten, the sheep need not be scattered while they have the Great Shepherd to go to. And it is better to be drawn to Christ by want and loss, than not to come to him at all.</body></html>
