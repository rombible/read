They too were led, in that moment of wonder, to the confession that the Prophet of Nazareth was more than man, and in this, as far as the Gospel record goes, they anticipated the faith even of the foremost of the disciples. It is significant that Peter's confession that He was "the Son of God," or "the Holy One of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-69.htm" title="And we believe and are sure that you are that Christ, the Son of the living God.">John 6:69</a>), follows shortly upon this.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - Matthew only. <span class="cmt_word">Then</span> - and (Revised Version, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>) - <span class="cmt_word">they that were in the ship;</span> boat (Revised Version). If there were others than the disciples in the boat, as is probable, these also would be included; but the disciples would naturally take the lead (cf. the notes on Matthew 8:23, 27). <span class="cmt_word">Came and.</span> The Revised Version omits these two words, with the manuscripts. They are due to the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-2.htm">Matthew 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-18.htm">Matthew 9:18</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Worshipped him</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-9.htm">Matthew 4:9</a>, note). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-27.htm">Matthew 8:27</a> we read of wonder; here, of homage. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Of a truth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>, <span class="accented">s.v.</span> "verily." The word seems to imply that the suggestion did not enter their minds now for the first time. Two had, perhaps, heard the words spoken at the baptism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>), and most of them, if not all, the utterance by the demons in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-29.htm">Matthew 8:29</a>. Yet these utterances in reality far surpassed what they even nosy imagined (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Thou art the Son of</span> <span class="cmt_word">God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;</span>). Although the phrase is not of the definite form found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a> and Matthew 16:16, where it is used with express reference to the Messiahship of Jesus (cf. for the intermediate form, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-40.htm">Matthew 27:40</a> with 43), yet it is impossible to take it here as merely referring to a moral relation between Jesus and God. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-54.htm">Matthew 27:54</a> this might be sufficient (Luke has "righteous"); but here there is no question of coming up to a standard of moral uprightness, but rather of manifestation of power, and this is connected with Messiah. His authority over the elements leads to the homage of those who witness its exercise, and forces from them the expression that he is the promised Representative of God on earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-15.htm">Matthew 2:15</a>, note). Observe, however, that not even so is it a profession of faith in his absolute Divinity. (Kubel's note on this subject in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-29.htm">Matthew 8:29</a> is very good.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:22-33 Those are not Christ's followers who cannot enjoy being alone with God and their own hearts. It is good, upon special occasions, and when we find our hearts enlarged, to continue long in secret prayer, and in pouring out our hearts before the Lord. It is no new thing for Christ's disciples to meet with storms in the way of duty, but he thereby shows himself with the more grace to them and for them. He can take what way he pleases to save his people. But even appearances of deliverance sometimes occasion trouble and perplexity to God's people, from mistakes about Christ. Nothing ought to affright those that have Christ near them, and know he is theirs; not death itself. Peter walked upon the water, not for diversion or to boast of it, but to go to Jesus; and in that he was thus wonderfully borne up. Special supports are promised, and are to be expected, but only in spiritual pursuits; nor can we ever come to Jesus, unless we are upheld by his power. Christ bade Peter come, not only that he might walk upon the water, and so know his Lord's power, but that he might know his own weakness. And the Lord often lets his servants have their choice, to humble and prove them, and to show the greatness of his power and grace. When we look off from Christ, and look at the greatness of opposing difficulties, we shall begin to fall; but when we call to him, he will stretch out his arm, and save us. Christ is the great Saviour; those who would be saved, must come to him, and cry to him, for salvation; we are never brought to this, till we find ourselves sinking: the sense of need drives us to him. He rebuked Peter. Could we but believe more, we should suffer less. The weakness of faith, and the prevailing of our doubts, displease our Lord Jesus, for there is no good reason why Christ's disciples should be of a doubtful mind. Even in a stormy day he is to them a very present help. None but the world's Creator could multiply the loaves, none but its Governor could tread upon the waters of the sea: the disciples yield to the evidence, and confess their faith. They were suitably affected, and worshipped Christ. He that comes to God, must believe; and he that believes in God, will come, Heb 11:6.</body></html>
