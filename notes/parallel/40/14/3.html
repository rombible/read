So of Micaiah by Ahab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-26.htm">2 Chronicles 18:26</a>, LXX., but not Lucian's text). Probably here in allusion to the distance of Machaerus from Herod's usual residence at Tiberius. Possibly, also, a reference to John being safer there from the designs of Herodias (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-19.htm">Mark 6:19, 20</a>). Anyhow, notice the stages in Herod's action - capture, binding, imprisonment in a place where he was quite out of the way. <span class="cmt_word">For Herodias' sake.</span> John was imprisoned, according to the New Testament, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as a punishment for his rebuke of Herod; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to protect him from Herodias' vengeance. (On the statement by Josephus, that it was for political reasons, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1</a>, note.) <span class="cmt_word">His brother Philip's wife.</span> According to Josephus ('Ant.,' 18:05. 4), the first husband of Herodias was "Herod," son of Herod the Great by Mariamne the high priest's daughter, and the daughter of Herodias, Salome, married Philip the tetrarch, who was also the son of Herod the Great by Cleopatra of Jerusalem. Hence many critics (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Ewald; Schurer, I. 2:22) suppose the account in Matthew and Mark to be mistaken, and due to a confusion of Herodias with her daughter. But, although it is curious that two sons of Herod the Great should have been called Philip, yet, in view of their being by different mothers, it cannot be pronounced impossible ("Antipas" and "Antipater" are <span class="accented">not</span> precisely identical). Besides, Herod the son of Mariamne would probably have had some other name than that of his father alone. It is noticeable that, in the same context, Josephus speaks also of Antipas by the name Herod only. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-12 The terror and reproach of conscience, which Herod, like other daring offenders, could not shake off, are proofs and warnings of a future judgment, and of future misery to them. But there may be the terror of convictions, where there is not the truth of conversion. When men pretend to favour the gospel, yet live in evil, we must not favour their self-delusion, but must deliver our consciences as John did. The world may call this rudeness and blind zeal. False professors, or timid Christians, may censure it as want of civility; but the most powerful enemies can go no further than the Lord sees good to permit. Herod feared that the putting of John to death might raise a rebellion among the people, which it did not; but he never feared it might stir up his own conscience against him, which it did. Men fear being hanged for what they do not fear being damned for. And times of carnal mirth and jollity are convenient times for carrying on bad designs against God's people. Herod would profusely reward a worthless dance, while imprisonment and death were the recompence of the man of God who sought the salvation of his soul. But there was real malice to John beneath his consent, or else Herod would have found ways to get clear of his promise. When the under shepherds are smitten, the sheep need not be scattered while they have the Great Shepherd to go to. And it is better to be drawn to Christ by want and loss, than not to come to him at all.</body></html>
