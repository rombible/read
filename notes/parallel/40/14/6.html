Such feasts were common enough in the imperial life at Rome, and that of Herod's birthday had become proverbial even there (Persius, <span class= "ital">Sat.</span> v., i. 180).<p><span class= "bld">The daughter of Herodias danced before them.</span>--Dances in filmy garments that but half concealed the form, commonly of an impure or voluptuous nature, were common enough both at Eastern and Roman banquets, the guests being simply spectators. But the dancers were for the most part women who made it their calling, like the nautch-girls of India; and it was a new thing, at which every decent Jew would shudder, for the daughter of a kingly house to come-thus into a shameless publicity and expose herself to the gaze of the banqueters, including as they did the chief captains and chiliarchs of the Roman legions, as well as Herod's own courtiers and the chief men of the province (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-21.htm" title="And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;">Mark 6:21</a>). But Herodias, it would seem, knew the tetrarch's weak point as well as Madame du Barry knew that of Louis XV. of France, and sought to bend him to her will, even though it were by the sacrifice of her daughter's modesty. She danced before them--literally, <span class= "ital">in the midst of them</span>--as they reclined on their couches indolently gazing. Her name is given by Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant. xviii.</span> 5, ? 4) as Salome.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span> <span class="cmt_word">when Herod's birthday was kept;</span> <span class="accented">came</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f29;&#x3c1;&#x1ff4;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, dative of time (Winer, &sect; 31:9), with the addition of a participle. <span class="accented">Birthday.</span> So "Pharaoh's birthday" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-20.htm">Genesis 40:20</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>).

Mark's text (like the Greek of Codex Bezae here) speaks of her as though she herself was called Herodias, and was the daughter of Antipas and Herodias; but the issue of this union could not then have been more than two years old (Schurer, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>). Besides, the trait mentioned by Mark (Mark 6:25), that she came back <span class="accented">with haste</span> to the king, asking for the head of the Baptist, implies that she was more than a child. Rendel Harris ('Texts and Studies,' II. 1. p. 68) suggests that the confusion is due to an early Latinization of the Greek from an ambiguous <span class="accented">ejus. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Danced.</span> Probably with the same kind of voluptuous dance as that of the Egyptian <span class="accented">almd</span> described by Warburton ('Crescent and Cross,' chap. 14.). But that a member of the royal family should so dance before a company must have been almost unheard cf. <span class="cmt_word">Before them;</span> <span class="accented">in the midst</span> (Revised Version). Matthew only. Such a dance with men sitting round would be specially abhorrent to the Jewish mind. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">pleased Herod.</span> And of course, as St. Mark adds, "them that sat with him" (cf. ver. 9). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-12 The terror and reproach of conscience, which Herod, like other daring offenders, could not shake off, are proofs and warnings of a future judgment, and of future misery to them. But there may be the terror of convictions, where there is not the truth of conversion. When men pretend to favour the gospel, yet live in evil, we must not favour their self-delusion, but must deliver our consciences as John did. The world may call this rudeness and blind zeal. False professors, or timid Christians, may censure it as want of civility; but the most powerful enemies can go no further than the Lord sees good to permit. Herod feared that the putting of John to death might raise a rebellion among the people, which it did not; but he never feared it might stir up his own conscience against him, which it did. Men fear being hanged for what they do not fear being damned for. And times of carnal mirth and jollity are convenient times for carrying on bad designs against God's people. Herod would profusely reward a worthless dance, while imprisonment and death were the recompence of the man of God who sought the salvation of his soul. But there was real malice to John beneath his consent, or else Herod would have found ways to get clear of his promise. When the under shepherds are smitten, the sheep need not be scattered while they have the Great Shepherd to go to. And it is better to be drawn to Christ by want and loss, than not to come to him at all.</body></html>
