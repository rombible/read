They were to sit down in companies of fifty or a hundred each, and thus the number of those who were fed became a matter of easy calculation. St. Mark, with a vivid picturesqueness, describes them as presenting the appearance of so many beds of flowers in a well-ordered garden. The bright colours of Eastern dress probably made the resemblance more striking than it would be with a like multitude so arranged among ourselves.<p><span class= "bld">Looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake.</span>--The act was natural and simple enough, the "saying grace" (St. John uses the word, "giving thanks") of the head of a Jewish household as he gathered his family around him. The formulae in such cases were commonly short and simple, like our own, such <span class= "ital">e.g.</span> as, "May God, the ever-blessed One, bless what He has given us." Looking, however, to the teaching which followed the miracle, as in John 6, and to our Lord's subsequent use at the Last Supper of the same words and acts, with others which gave them a new and higher meaning, we can hardly be wrong in thinking that as He now distributed the earthly bread to the hungering crowd, through the agency of His Apostles, there was present to His mind the thought that hereafter He would, through the same instrumentality, impart to souls that hungered after righteousness the gift of communion with Himself, that thus they might feed on the true Bread that cometh down from heaven.<p>It lies in the nature of the case, as a miracle of the highest order, that the process of multiplication is inconceivable in its details. Did each loaf, in succession, supply a thousand with food, and then come to an end, its place taken by another? Was the structure of the fishes, bone and skin and head, reproduced in each portion that was given to the guests at that great feast? We know not, and the Evangelists did not care to ask or to record. It was enough for them that the multitude "did all eat, and were filled."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> <span class="cmt_word">commanded the multitude;</span> <span class="accented">the multitudes</span> (Revised Version).

The addition of "green" (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) in Mark suits the time of the Passover (ver. 13, note), but hardly of any later feast, for the grass would have been dried up. <span class="cmt_word">And took the five</span> <span class="cmt_word">loaves, and the two fishes.</span> He used all the means there were. <span class="cmt_word">And looking up</span> <span class="cmt_word">to heaven.</span> So also <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-34.htm">Mark 7:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-1.htm">John 17:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">He blessed.</span> He may well have used the blessing that is still used over bread ("Blessed art thou, Jehovah our God, King of the world, that causest bread to come forth from the earth"); for this can be apparently traced to the second or <span class="date">third century A.D.</span>, and is probably much older still (cf. Edersheim, 'Life,' 1:684; Zunz, 'Gottesdienstliche Vortrage,' p. 371, edit. 1832). (For the habit of saying grace before meals, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-36.htm">Matthew 15:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-26.htm">Matthew 26:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-6.htm">Romans 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-30.htm">1 Corinthians 10:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-5.htm">1 Timothy 4:5</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-13.htm">1 Samuel 9:13</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">And brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</span> That the people received the bread at the hands of the disciples is not mentioned by St. John. Perhaps because his chapter dwells so much on the need of direct contact with Christ. But Christ's work through his agents, both before and after his time on earth, is an important point with the synoptists. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:13-21 When Christ and his word withdraw, it is best for us to follow, seeking the means of grace for our souls before any worldly advantages. The presence of Christ and his gospel, makes a desert not only tolerable, but desirable. This little supply of bread was increased by Christ's creating power, till the whole multitude were satisfied. In seeking the welfare of men's souls, we should have compassion on their bodies likewise. Let us also remember always to crave a blessing on our meals, and learn to avoid all waste, as frugality is the proper source of liberality. See in this miracle an emblem of the Bread of life, which came down from heaven to sustain our perishing souls. The provisions of Christ's gospel appear mean and scanty to the world, yet they satisfy all that feed on him in their hearts by faith with thanksgiving.</body></html>
