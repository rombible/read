It led those who witnessed it to the conclusion that "this was the Prophet that should come into the world." They sought to seize Him and make Him a king against His will (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-14.htm" title="Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.">John 6:14-15</a>), and He, shrinking from that form of sovereignty, withdrew from His disciples, dismissed the multitude, and on the mountain height passed the night in prayer. The disciples at His bidding were crossing to the other side to Bethsaida (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-45.htm" title="And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before to Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.">Mark 6:45</a>)--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to the town of that name on the western shore of the lake near Capernaum (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-17.htm" title="And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.">John 6:17</a>). It was, we may reverently say, as if in this unwonted stir of popular excitement--not against Him, but in His favour--this nearness to a path of earthly greatness instead of that which led onward to the cross, He saw something like a renewal of the temptation in the wilderness, needing special communion with His Father, that He might once again resist and overcome it. And once again, therefore, He desired to pass through the conflict alone, as afterwards in Gethsemane, with no human eye to witness the temptation or the victory.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-33.</span> - Christ's power over the elements. He walks on the water and stays the storm. St. Peter's attempt to walk on the water is successful so long as he exercises faith on Christ. Jesus receives homage as Messiah. Parallel passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-45.htm">Mark 6:45-52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15-21</a>. It is strange that the incident of St. Peter is recorded in Matthew only, and not in Mark, for it serves to emphasize what is a leading thought of the preceding narrative, even in Mark, viz. the power that believers receive by virtue of faith on Christ (vers. 16, 19). With Christ in the boat, difficulties cease (ver. 32); they that believe on him can triumph as he did (vers. 28-31; cf. the thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-19.htm">John 14:19</a>, end). For St. John's purpose the mention of St. Peter was not necessary; since, by way of introduction to the following discourse, be desired rather to familiarize his readers with the idea of Christ's body being triumphant over earthly limitations (cf. ver. 19, note). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples.</span> It was not their wish to leave him, especially when the multitudes seemed likely to elect him king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a>). But from the temptation to side with the multitudes our Lord desired now to shield them. Separation and physical work (ver. 24) would calm their excitement, and the object lesson that their Master already ruled over wind and sea would lead them to more perfect trust in his methods. Another reason for his sending them forward may have been that they should use the failing light; and yet another, that he himself desired time for prayer. <span class="cmt_word">To get into a ship;</span> <span class="accented">a boat</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-23.htm">Matthew 8:23</a> (<span class="accented">the boat</span>, Revised Version, reading <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">And to go before him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-9.htm">Matthew 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>).

Probably they landed at the western Bethsaida (ver. 13, note), in Gennesaret (ver. 34), and went on to Capernaum, where our Lord again addressed the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-24.htm">John 6:24-26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">While he sent</span> - <span class="accented">till he should send</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-33.htm">Matthew 13:33</a> - <span class="cmt_word">the multitudes away.</span> Why should this take up time? Why did he not dismiss them then and there? Possibly they were too eager to carry out their own plans on his behalf to attend to only one expression of his wish. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:22-33 Those are not Christ's followers who cannot enjoy being alone with God and their own hearts. It is good, upon special occasions, and when we find our hearts enlarged, to continue long in secret prayer, and in pouring out our hearts before the Lord. It is no new thing for Christ's disciples to meet with storms in the way of duty, but he thereby shows himself with the more grace to them and for them. He can take what way he pleases to save his people. But even appearances of deliverance sometimes occasion trouble and perplexity to God's people, from mistakes about Christ. Nothing ought to affright those that have Christ near them, and know he is theirs; not death itself. Peter walked upon the water, not for diversion or to boast of it, but to go to Jesus; and in that he was thus wonderfully borne up. Special supports are promised, and are to be expected, but only in spiritual pursuits; nor can we ever come to Jesus, unless we are upheld by his power. Christ bade Peter come, not only that he might walk upon the water, and so know his Lord's power, but that he might know his own weakness. And the Lord often lets his servants have their choice, to humble and prove them, and to show the greatness of his power and grace. When we look off from Christ, and look at the greatness of opposing difficulties, we shall begin to fall; but when we call to him, he will stretch out his arm, and save us. Christ is the great Saviour; those who would be saved, must come to him, and cry to him, for salvation; we are never brought to this, till we find ourselves sinking: the sense of need drives us to him. He rebuked Peter. Could we but believe more, we should suffer less. The weakness of faith, and the prevailing of our doubts, displease our Lord Jesus, for there is no good reason why Christ's disciples should be of a doubtful mind. Even in a stormy day he is to them a very present help. None but the world's Creator could multiply the loaves, none but its Governor could tread upon the waters of the sea: the disciples yield to the evidence, and confess their faith. They were suitably affected, and worshipped Christ. He that comes to God, must believe; and he that believes in God, will come, Heb 11:6.</body></html>
