Here we get a great aggregate of miracles, unrecorded in detail, working on the minds of the multitude, and leading them to repeated utterances of praise in the form of a doxology--they "glorified the God of Israel."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - The incidents in this and the following verse are mentioned only by St. Matthew. <span class="cmt_word">Great multitudes.</span> The fame of Jesus attracted the Jews settled in this semi-Gentile district, and cut short the privacy which he had lately been enjoying in his apostles' company. The people seized the opportunity of listening to his teaching and profiting by his superhuman power. <span class="cmt_word">Having with them.</span> The catalogue of sufferers that follows represents accurately the sight that meets one in Oriental towns and villages, where the absence of medical appliances and the general want of surgical treatment render slight maladies or injuries chronic and inveterate, and fill the streets with persons in all stages of disease. <span class="cmt_word">Maimed</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">debiles</span> (Vulgate). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-8.htm">Matthew 18:8</a> the word means "deprived of a member;" but it has been doubted whether our Lord ever exerted his creative power to replace an absent limb. In the case of Malchus the ear probably was not wholly severed from the skull, but was still attached thereto by a fragment of flesh or skin, and no fresh creation was needed. We may well understand the word to signify "deformed," or deprived of the use of hand or foot. The Arabic Version renders it "dried up," or "withered." <span class="cmt_word">Cast them down.</span> The expression implies the precipitancy With which their friends offered the sufferers to Christ's notice, appealing to his mercy and relying on his power - not with careless abandonment, but with an earnest rivalry to be first attended to. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:29-39 Whatever our case is, the only way to find ease and relief, is to lay it at Christ's feet, to submit it to him, and refer it to his disposal. Those who would have spiritual healing from Christ, must be ruled as he pleases. See what work sin has made; what various diseases human bodies are subject to. Here were such diseases as fancy could neither guess the cause nor the cure of, yet these were subject to the command of Christ. The spiritual cures that Christ works are wonderful. When blind souls are made to see by faith, the dumb to speak in prayer, the maimed and the lame to walk in holy obedience, it is to be wondered at. His power was also shown to the multitude, in the plentiful provision he made for them: the manner is much the same as before. All did eat, and were filled. Those whom Christ feeds, he fills. With Christ there is bread enough, and to spare; supplies of grace for more than seek it, and for those that seek for more. Christ sent away the people. Though he had fed them twice, they must not look for miracles to find their daily bread. Let them go home to their callings and their own tables. Lord, increase our faith, and pardon our unbelief, teaching us to live upon thy fulness and bounty, for all things pertaining to this life, and that which is to come.</body></html>
