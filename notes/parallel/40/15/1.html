They had been prominent in like accusations. It was by them that our Lord had been accused of blasphemy in forgiving sins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-3.htm" title="And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemes.">Matthew 9:3</a>), of eating and drinking with publicans and sinners (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-11.htm" title="And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, Why eats your Master with publicans and sinners?">Matthew 9:11</a>), of disregarding fasts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-14.htm" title="Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but your disciples fast not?">Matthew 9:14</a>), of casting out devils by Beelzebub (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-24.htm" title="But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow does not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.">Matthew 12:24</a>), of Sabbath-breaking (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-2.htm" title="But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, Behold, your disciples do that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath day.">Matthew 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-10.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.">Matthew 12:10</a>). It was, we may believe, their presence in the synagogue of Capernaum which led our Lord to adopt (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-26.htm" title="Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, You seek me, not because you saw the miracles, but because you did eat of the loaves, and were filled.">John 6:26-65</a>) a form of teaching so unlike the usual tenor of that of His Galilean ministry. And now they return to the charge again with a new and characteristic accusation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-20.</span> - <span class="accented">Discourse concerning ceremonial pollution.</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-1.htm">Mark 7:1-23</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>. This is after the third Passover, which whether our Lord attended or not, has been a matter of some dispute. Moral considerations would make us infer that he was present, fulfilling all righteousness, though there is no direct statement in our narratives on the subject. <span class="cmt_word">Came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying.</span> The Sinaitic, B, and some other manuscripts read, <span class="accented">Came to Jesus from Jerusalem scribes and Pharisees.</span> This, which is virtually the reading of the Revised Version, whether original or not, seems to represent the fact correctly. The bigoted rabbis of the capital, aroused to fresh action by the news of Christ's success in Galilee, send emissaries from Jerusalem to see if they cannot find some cause of offence in the words or actions of this rash Innovator which may give the desired opportunity of crushing him. An occasion offered itself, and was immediately seized. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-9 Additions to God's laws reflect upon his wisdom, as if he had left out something which was needed, and which man could supply; in one way or other they always lead men to disobey God. How thankful ought we to be for the written word of God! Never let us think that the religion of the Bible can be improved by any human addition, either in doctrine or practice. Our blessed Lord spoke of their traditions as inventions of their own, and pointed out one instance in which this was very clear, that of their transgressing the fifth commandment. When a parent's wants called for assistance, they pleaded, that they had devoted to the temple all they could spare, even though they did not part with it, and therefore their parents must expect nothing from them. This was making the command of God of no effect. The doom of hypocrites is put in a little compass; In vain do they worship me. It will neither please God, nor profit themselves; they trust in vanity, and vanity will be their recompence.</body></html>
