The last clause is not in the Greek; it is supplied by our translators, as it was in Coverdale's version, to complete the apodosis. There are various methods of translating the passage. Retaining <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> at the beginning of the sentence, some make these words the continuation of the gloss, "Whosoever shall say," etc., the apodosis being found in the sentence following. Others conceive an aposiopesis after "be profited by me," as if Christ refrained from pronouncing the hypocritical and indeed blasphemous words which completed the gloss. In this case the apodosis follows in ver. 6, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, <span class="accented">then such a one will not honour</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>), etc. The words are best taken as put into the Pharisees' mouth in the sense, "The man under those circumstances shall not honour," etc.; he is free from the obligation of helping his parents. The form of the sentence (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> with the future verb) is prohibitory rather than predictive, and implies, "he is forbidden to honour." Christ thus sharply emphasizes the contradiction between God's Law and man's perversion thereof. St. Mark has, "Ye no longer suffer him to do aught for his father." Thus; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> in the apodosis, removing the full stop before it in the Authorized Version. This is our Lord's own saying. <span class="cmt_word">Made...of none effect.</span> Evacuated its real force and spirit. <span class="cmt_word">By</span>; owing to, for the sake of, as St. Mark says, "that ye may keep your tradition." Our translators often mistake the meaning of the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> with the accusative, which never signifies "by means of." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-9 Additions to God's laws reflect upon his wisdom, as if he had left out something which was needed, and which man could supply; in one way or other they always lead men to disobey God. How thankful ought we to be for the written word of God! Never let us think that the religion of the Bible can be improved by any human addition, either in doctrine or practice. Our blessed Lord spoke of their traditions as inventions of their own, and pointed out one instance in which this was very clear, that of their transgressing the fifth commandment. When a parent's wants called for assistance, they pleaded, that they had devoted to the temple all they could spare, even though they did not part with it, and therefore their parents must expect nothing from them. This was making the command of God of no effect. The doom of hypocrites is put in a little compass; In vain do they worship me. It will neither please God, nor profit themselves; they trust in vanity, and vanity will be their recompence.</body></html>
