He had called on men to forsake father and mother for the sake of the gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-18.htm" title="And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.">Matthew 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-22.htm" title="And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.">Matthew 4:22</a>), and had excluded from discipleship those who loved father and mother more than they loved Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-37.htm" title="He that loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.">Matthew 10:37</a>). We need not close our eyes to the difficulty which thus presents itself. But the answer is not far to seek. In our Lord's teaching, a lower, natural duty was to give way exceptionally to a higher and supernatural one; otherwise it remained in full force. In that of the Pharisees the natural duty, enforced by a direct divine commandment, was made to give way to one which was purely human, arbitrary, and conventional. The two cases were not only not analogous, but stood on an entirely different footing.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - Christ proceeds to give an instance of the evacuation of the Law by means of tradition. <span class="cmt_word">God commanded.</span> Mark, in the parallel passage, has, "Moses said," which may be taken, in conjunction with our text, as conveying our Lord's testimony to the Divine origin of the Mosaic code. Christ cites the fifth commandment, because it more especially appealed to the conscience of every one, and was emphasized by the solemn enactment of death as the penalty of its infringement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-17.htm">Exodus 21:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Honour</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). This term includes the idea of succor and support, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-3.htm">1 Timothy 5:3</a>, "Honour widows that are widows indeed;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> means "stipend." In Ecclus. 38:1, "Honour a physician with the honours due unto him," the expression has reference to his proper fees, the <span class="accented">honorarium</span> paid for his services. In God's view honour to parents is not shown only in outward salutations, obedience, and respect, but also in material assistance, help provided for their needs, alms freely bestowed when necessary. This well known signification makes the tradition next given more inexcusable. <span class="cmt_word">Die the death.</span> An Hebraism, equivalent to "shall surely be put to death" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>, margin).
