Here, everything seems sudden and abrupt. There we learn that those who were now called had some months before accepted Him as the Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-35.htm" title="Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;">John 1:35-43</a>), and had, some or all of them, been with Him during His visit to Jerusalem. Simon had already received the surname of Cephas or Peter or the Rock. Putting these facts together, we have something like a clear outline picture of their previous life. The sons of Jona and the sons of Zebedee had grown up in Bethsaida (probably on the north-west shore of the Lake of Galilee), and were partners in their work as fishermen. The movement of Judas of Galilee, in his assertion of national independence, had probably served to quicken their expectations of a good time coming, when they should be free from their oppressors. When they heard of the preaching of the Baptist, they joined the crowds that flocked to hear him, and received his baptism of repentance. Then they were pointed to the Lamb of God, and received Him as the Christ. Then for a short time they were His companions in His journeyings. When He began the first circuit of His Galilean ministry He was alone, and left them to return to their old calling. They could not tell whether He would ever care to use their services again, and it was under these circumstances that the new call came. St. Matthew's narrative and St. Mark's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/1-16.htm" title="Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.">Mark 1:16-20</a>) agree almost verbally; St. Luke's presents more difficulty. Is it another and fuller version of the same facts? or, if different, did what he records precede or follow the call which they relate? The first view seems the most probable, but see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/5-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed on him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,">Luke 5:1-11</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-22.</span> - The <span class="accented">summons to help in his work: his first formal adherents.</span> (Parallel passage: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-16.htm">Mark 1:16-20</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-1.htm">Luke 5:1, 2, 9-11</a>, very doubtful, but cf. Godet].) On the relation of this call to the meeting with Andrew and Peter, recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-40.htm">John 1:40-42</a>, <span class="accented">vide</span> especially Bishop Westcott there. That was "the establishment of a personal relationship;" this "a call to an official work." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus, walking</span>. Revised Version rightly omits "Jesus," and inserts "he" before "saw." The right reading does not detract so much from the emphatic statement of ver. 17. <span class="cmt_word">By the Sea of Galilee</span>. His walk lay along the lake. Socin ('Baedeker,' p. 372) speaks of "the probability that there was a frequented road from the mouth of the Jordan skirting the bank of the lake." <span class="cmt_word">Two brethren, Simon... and Andrew his brother</span>; the addition, "his brother," emphasizing the relationship. Christ's coming would divide households (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-21.htm">Matthew 10:21</a>). He would, therefore, be the more glad when members of one family united in following him. <span class="accented">Simon</span>, etc. (vide <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-2.htm">Matthew 10:2</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">Called</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">who is called</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not specially by Christ, but in common usage among Christians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-2.htm">Matthew 10:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Casting a net</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (no <span class="accented">var. lect.</span>). Probably later than and explanatory of the form found in the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-16.htm">Mark 1:16</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (alone). <span class="accented">A net</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a casting-net of circular, bell-like shape, "which, when skilfully cast from over the shoulder by one standing on the shore or in a boat, spreads out into a circle (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) as it falls upon the water, and then, sinking swiftly by the weight of the leads attached to it, encloses whatever is below it" (Trench, 'Syn.,' &sect; 64.). It specializes <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (any net, ver 20), and differs from <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> (the long draw-net, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-47.htm">Matthew 13:47</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:18-22 When Christ began to preach, he began to gather disciples, who should be hearers, and afterwards preachers of his doctrine, who should be witnesses of his miracles, and afterwards testify concerning them. He went not to Herod's court, not to Jerusalem, among the chief priests and the elders, but to the sea of Galilee, among the fishermen. The same power which called Peter and Andrew, could have wrought upon Annas and Caiaphas, for with God nothing is impossible. But Christ chooses the foolish things of the world to confound the wise. Diligence in an honest calling is pleasing to Christ, and it is no hinderance to a holy life. Idle people are more open to the temptations of Satan than to the calls of God. It is a happy and hopeful thing to see children careful of their parents, and dutiful. When Christ comes, it is good to be found doing. Am I in Christ? is a very needful question to ask ourselves; and, next to that, Am I in my calling? They had followed Christ before, as common disciples, Joh 1:37; now they must leave their calling. Those who would follow Christ aright, must, at his command, leave all things to follow him, must be ready to part with them. This instance of the power of the Lord Jesus encourages us to depend upon his grace. He speaks, and it is done.</body></html>
