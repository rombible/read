At this stage comes in the imprisonment of John (mentioned here, but not narrated till 14:3-5) and the consequent journey through Samaria to Galilee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/4-1.htm" title="When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,">John 4:1-42</a>). The verse now before us may be noted as implying a ministry in Judaea, which for some reason the writer does not narrate.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-16.</span> - JESUS' WITHDRAWAL INTO GALILEE. (Parallel passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-14.htm">Mark 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-14.htm">Luke 4:14, 15</a>.) According to some commentators, a new section begins here; but probably these verses are still preliminary. Our Lord's activity does not begin till ver. 17. But now he withdraws to Galilee, settling in Capernaum, thus fulfilling prophecy. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now when Jesus had heard</span>. If we had the synoptic Gospels alone, we should have supposed that the Baptist was imprisoned immediately after the end of our Lord's temptation (cf. this verse with <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-14.htm">Luke 4:14</a>); but St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-24.htm">John 3:24</a>) expressly states that he had not been cast into prison when the events recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-43.htm">John 1:43-3:23</a> took place. "For a time Christ and the Baptist worked side by side, preaching ' repentance' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a> [also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>]) and baptizing [<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-22.htm">John 3:22</a>]. The Messiah took up the position of a prophet in Judaea, as afterwards in Galilee" (Bishop Westcott, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-22.htm">John 3:22-24</a>). The events in Galilee related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-1.htm">John 2:1-12</a> were "preparatory to the manifestation at Jerusalem which was the real commencement of Christ's Messianic work. St. John records the course and issue of this manifestation: the other Evangelists start with the record of the Galilaean ministry, which dates from the imprisonment of the Baptist" (Bishop Westcott, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-24.htm">John 3:24</a>). He adds, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-43.htm">John 4:43</a>, "It seems probable that the earlier part of the synoptic narratives (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-14.htm">Mark 1:14 - 2:14</a>, and parallels) must be placed in the interval which extended from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-43.htm">John 4:43-5:1</a>." Matthew alone states directly that the news of the Baptist having been taken by Herod was the motive of our Lord's withdrawal into Galilee. He says nothing to show whether our Lord withdrew because he would avoid a like treatment himself, or, as is on the whole more likely, because he did not wish to be mixed up in the tumults to which John's capture appears to have given rise (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-5.htm">Matthew 14:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Was cast into prison;</span> "was delivered up" (Revised Version and Authorized Version margin); <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, absolutely (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-14.htm">Mark 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-25.htm">Romans 4:25</a>; also <span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-19.htm">Matthew 10:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-3.htm">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>). If the more proper meaning of the word may be insisted on, the thought is of the person to whom John was committed rather than of the place; John being delivered up, that is to say, by Herod to his officials. But in usage it appears rather to mean only compulsory removal, loss of liberty. Mark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-19.htm">Mark 6:19, 20</a>) points out the temporary protection that the imprisonment gave to John against the resentment of Herodias. <span class="cmt_word">He departed</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">he withdrew</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>,. A favourite word of St. Matthew's (ten times; Mark and John once each; Acts twice). It always implies some motive for the change of place, and is frequently used of departure directly consequent upon knowledge acquired. Hence it often implies a feeling of danger. Into Galilee; whence he had come (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-13.htm">Matthew 3:13</a>). Hence "returned" (Luke). In Galilee he would still be in Herod's dominions; but, as being in his own home, he would not attract so much attention. N.B. - Between vers. 12 and 13 some place the incident of his preaching at Nazareth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-30</a>); but ver. 23 of that passage assumes much previous work at Capernaum, and can therefore hardly be as early as this. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:12-17 It is just with God to take the gospel and the means of grace, from those that slight them and thrust them away. Christ will not stay long where he is not welcome. Those who are without Christ, are in the dark. They were sitting in this condition, a contented posture; they chose it rather than light; they were willingly ignorant. When the gospel comes, light comes; when it comes to any place, when it comes to any soul, it makes day there. Light discovers and directs; so does the gospel. The doctrine of repentance is right gospel doctrine. Not only the austere John Baptist, but the gracious Jesus, preached repentance. There is still the same reason to do so. The kingdom of heaven was not reckoned to be fully come, till the pouring out of the Holy Spirit after Christ's ascension.</body></html>
