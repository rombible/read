Our Lord's ministry, with the one exception of the journey to the coasts of Tyre and Sidon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-21.htm" title="Then Jesus went there, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.">Matthew 15:21</a>), was confined to what is commonly known as Palestine. Traces of the wider fame are, however, found in the mention of hearers from Idumaea, and Tyre, and Sidon among the crowds that followed Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-8.htm" title="And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came to him.">Mark 3:8</a>); in the faith of the Syro-Ph?nician woman in His power to heal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-26.htm" title="The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she sought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.">Mark 7:26</a>); perhaps in the existence of disciples at Damascus so soon after the Ascension (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-2.htm" title="And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.">Acts 9:2</a>); perhaps, also, in St. Peter's appeal to the friends of Cornelius at Caesarea, as knowing already the broad facts of our Lord's ministry and miraculous working (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-37.htm" title="That word, I say, you know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;">Acts 10:37</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Possessed with devils. . . . lunatick.</span>--The phenomena of what is called possession, and the theories to which the phenomena have been referred, will best be discussed in dealing with the great representative instance of the Gadarene demoniacs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-28.htm" title="And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.">Matthew 8:28</a>). Here it will be enough to notice (1) that the word rendered "devil" is not the same as that used for the Tempter in 4:1, but "demon" in the sense of an evil spirit, (2) that the possessed with demons are at once grouped with the "lunaticks," both exhibiting forms of mental disease, and distinguished from them. The latter term implies in the Greek, as in the Latin and our own, "moonstruck madness"--the belief that the moon exercised a disturbing influence on the brain (a <span class= "ital">coup de lune</span> being dreaded by Eastern travellers almost as much as a <span class= "ital">coup de soleil</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and that the intensity of the disturbance varied, when the disease had once set in, with the moon's changes.<p><span class= "bld">Those that had the palsy.</span>--Here the word (literally, <span class= "ital">the paralytics</span>) points, not to a view of the cause of the disease, but to its conspicuous phenomena--the want of muscular power to control motion, and the consequent "looseness," in popular phraseology, of limbs or head.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his fame</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">and the report of him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>).

We do not now find the Saviour's miraculous healing power in our bodies; but if we are cured by medicine, the praise is equally his. Three general words are here used. He healed every sickness or disease; none was too bad; none too hard, for Christ to heal with a word. Three diseases are named; the palsy, which is the greatest weakness of the body; lunacy, which is the greatest malady of the mind; and possession of the devil, which is the greatest misery and calamity of both; yet Christ healed all, and by thus curing bodily diseases, showed that his great errand into the world was to cure spiritual maladies. Sin is the sickness, disease, and torment of the soul: Christ came to take away sin, and so to heal the soul.</body></html>
