We have to recognise the fact that the Evangelist did not study prophecy as we study it. Books were scarce, and the publican of Capernaum, though his occupation implied some clerkly knowledge, probably had few, and heard rather than read the Scriptures which he quotes. What strikes a man who learns in this way is the coincidence of single words and phrases with familiar facts. He speaks not of what has been <span class= "ital">written,</span> but of what has been <span class= "ital">spoken.</span> He is not careful about the context. When St. Matthew looked back on the change that had come over Capernaum in the arrival of the prophet of Nazareth--a change extending to his own life--these words seemed the only adequate description of it. Here was the very scene of which Isaiah had spoken, the old border country of Zebulon and of Naphthali. To him and to others who had been in the darkness of spiritual ignorance, neglected and uncared for, as sheep gone astray in the dark valley of death, there had sprung up a marvellous Light. Unconsciously he adds his testimony to that of St. John, that the presence of Jesus was felt to be that of the "true Light" that "lighteth every man" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The land of Zabulon</span>, etc. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1, 2</a>, spoiled in the Authorized Version, but rendered correctly in the Revised Version. Isaiah says that those parts of the land which had borne the first brunt of the Assyrian invasions under Tiglath-Pileser (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>; el. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-10.htm">Zechariah 10:10</a>), shall be proportionately glorified by the advent of Messiah. Wetstein gives a tradition from the 'Pesikt. Zut.,' of Messiah ben Joseph first appearing in Galilee; but the whole passage (quoted in Dalman's 'Der Leidende und der Sterbende Messias,' pp. 10-13) clearly points to a knowledge of the New Testament. As to the form of the quotation, observe: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Matthew disregards the Hebrew construction, and gives merely the general sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> He takes it from the Hebrew, not the LXX. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> This last point is doubtless to be connected with the fact that the quotation does not occur in the other Gospels, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that it did not belong to the Petrine cycle of teaching, and if it did belong to the "Matthean" cycle, not to that form which was current among Gentile Christians (cf. A. Wright, 'Composition of the Four Gospels.' p. 104). <span class="cmt_word">Zabulon and... Nephthalim</span>, equivalent to the later Upper and Lower Galilee. <span class="cmt_word">By the way of the sea</span>; <span class="accented">toward the sea</span> (Revised Version); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>; "<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the district on the W. of the Sea of Galilee, as opposed to 'the other side of Jordan,' and 'the circle of the nations,' <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the frontier districts nearest to Phoenicia, including 'the land of Cabul' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11-13</a>), which formed part of the later Upper Galilee. <span class="accented">Via Marls</span>, M. Renan observes, was the name of the high road from Acre to Damascus, as late as the Crusades. 'Way,' however, here means 'region' (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-4.htm">Job 24:4</a>)" (Cheyne, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>). Yet hardly so; <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, is adverbial, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-48.htm">1 Kings 8:48</a> (equivalent to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-38.htm">2 Chronicles 6:38</a>), and designates the stretching of the districts of Zebulun and Naphtali towards the sea. The sea is the Sea of Galilee. The close union of this clause in the Authorized Version with the following words, "beyond Jordan," misses its true meaning as explanatory of the position of Zebulun and Naphtali, and rather takes it as describing some special locality east of Jordan. <span class="cmt_word">Beyond Jordan</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the eastern side, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a> as having suffered with Naphtali under the Assyrian invasion; see further ver. 25. Galilee of the Gentiles (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>, "by the way of the sea"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:12-17 It is just with God to take the gospel and the means of grace, from those that slight them and thrust them away. Christ will not stay long where he is not welcome. Those who are without Christ, are in the dark. They were sitting in this condition, a contented posture; they chose it rather than light; they were willingly ignorant. When the gospel comes, light comes; when it comes to any place, when it comes to any soul, it makes day there. Light discovers and directs; so does the gospel. The doctrine of repentance is right gospel doctrine. Not only the austere John Baptist, but the gracious Jesus, preached repentance. There is still the same reason to do so. The kingdom of heaven was not reckoned to be fully come, till the pouring out of the Holy Spirit after Christ's ascension.</body></html>
