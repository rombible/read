It is important to remember that it had been preceded by a ministry of some months in Judaea; that that ministry had been outwardly like that of the Baptist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-1.htm" title="When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,">John 4:1</a>); and that He had withdrawn from it upon John's imprisonment because He knew that His own growing fame had attracted the notice of the Pharisees. Taking the data given by <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-13.htm" title="And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.">John 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-23.htm" title="Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.">John 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-1.htm" title="After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.">John 5:1</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-4.htm" title="And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.">John 6:4</a>, we are able to fix the time of His first appearance as a prophet in His own country in the autumn or winter of the interval between the Passover of A.D. 26 and that of A.D. 27.<p>Of the usual method of our Lord's synagogue-preaching, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/4-17.htm" title="And there was delivered to him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,">Luke 4:17-21</a> gives us a representative example. To read the prophetic lesson for the day, to make that His text, to proclaim the necessity of repentance and the good news of forgiveness following on repentance, to bear His witness that "the kingdom of heaven" was not in the far-off future, but nigh at hand, in the midst of them--this we must believe was, <span class= "ital">at</span> this time, as ever, the substance of His teaching and preaching. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-23.htm" title="And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.">Matthew 4:23</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17-16:20.</span> - THE FIRST STAGE OF CHRIST'S WORK AND TEACHING. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17</span> - The <span class="accented">proclamation. <span class="cmt_word"></span>From that time</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> (elsewhere in the New Testament only <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-16.htm">Matthew 26:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-16.htm">Luke 16:16</a>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the time of his residence in Capernaum (ver. 13). Apparently our Lord, after the baptism, went to John (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>, ver. 1), then retired to Galilee, going first to Nazareth, then finally leaving it as his home for Capernaum. At Caper-nauru his public activity begins. <span class="accented">From that time</span>; the phrase expresses not merely "at that time," but "from that time," as the starting-point. Henceforth this was to be his message, even though its form might be altered. The phrase marks, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>, the commencement of a new stage in his life. His earlier work with John the Baptist is not included in the oral Gospel, probably because the twelve were not yet joined to him in formal and continuous adhesion. <span class="cmt_word">Repent</span>, etc. His words are exactly the same as the Baptist's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>), with whom, indeed, he had been very lately associated. There is no evidence that he meant by them anything else than the Baptist meant (cf. Introduction, p. 24.). It is very intelligible that quite early (Old Syriac) an attempt should be made to harmonize this summary of his preaching rather with that of his disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-7.htm">Matthew 10:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:12-17 It is just with God to take the gospel and the means of grace, from those that slight them and thrust them away. Christ will not stay long where he is not welcome. Those who are without Christ, are in the dark. They were sitting in this condition, a contented posture; they chose it rather than light; they were willingly ignorant. When the gospel comes, light comes; when it comes to any place, when it comes to any soul, it makes day there. Light discovers and directs; so does the gospel. The doctrine of repentance is right gospel doctrine. Not only the austere John Baptist, but the gracious Jesus, preached repentance. There is still the same reason to do so. The kingdom of heaven was not reckoned to be fully come, till the pouring out of the Holy Spirit after Christ's ascension.</body></html>
