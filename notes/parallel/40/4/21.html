It must be remembered, however, (1) that the "mending" as well as "washing" flowed naturally even on a night of unsuccessful fishing, and (2) that the Greek of St. Luke does not say that the nets actually broke, but that they were on the point of breaking, and were beginning to do so.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Other two brethren</span> (cf. ver. 18, note); in Matthew only. <span class="cmt_word">James the son of Zebedee</span>. Why is the father of Peter and Andrew never mentioned, save incidentally, and by our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-42.htm">John 1:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>)? Probably Zebedee and his wife Salome became, unlike Peter's parents, well-known believers. It may be that Peter was the eldest of the Twelve, and that his father was already dead or, though perhaps believing on Jesus, was too old to take any special part in the work. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-10.htm">Luke 5:10</a>) adds, "Who were partners with Simon" - an item of information perhaps obtained from the same source as his first and second chapters. In a ship; in <span class="accented">the boot</span> (Revised Version), and so always in the Gospels. The word (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) may be used of any sized vessel (equivalent to "large ship ' in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a>.), but here, as managed by so few men, it is equivalent to "boat." Other words translated "boat" in the New Testament are <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "little boat" (Mark once, John four times), and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;</span>, "small ship's boat" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-16.htm">Acts 27:16, 30, 32</a>). Josephus says ('Bell. Jud.,' 2:21.8) that when he gathered all the boats on the lake to attack Tiberius, there were "not more than four sailors in each;" by which he probably means, not the number of men wherewith he was able to equip them, but the number he found already managing them. <span class="cmt_word">With Zebedee their father</span>. In Matthew only. <span class="cmt_word">Mending their nets</span>. The first pair of brothers were in the excitement of catching; the second had perhaps caught, and were mending their nets with a view to a fresh attempt; in neither case was there a moment's delay. <span class="cmt_word">And he called them</span>. This time his words are not given. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:18-22 When Christ began to preach, he began to gather disciples, who should be hearers, and afterwards preachers of his doctrine, who should be witnesses of his miracles, and afterwards testify concerning them. He went not to Herod's court, not to Jerusalem, among the chief priests and the elders, but to the sea of Galilee, among the fishermen. The same power which called Peter and Andrew, could have wrought upon Annas and Caiaphas, for with God nothing is impossible. But Christ chooses the foolish things of the world to confound the wise. Diligence in an honest calling is pleasing to Christ, and it is no hinderance to a holy life. Idle people are more open to the temptations of Satan than to the calls of God. It is a happy and hopeful thing to see children careful of their parents, and dutiful. When Christ comes, it is good to be found doing. Am I in Christ? is a very needful question to ask ourselves; and, next to that, Am I in my calling? They had followed Christ before, as common disciples, Joh 1:37; now they must leave their calling. Those who would follow Christ aright, must, at his command, leave all things to follow him, must be ready to part with them. This instance of the power of the Lord Jesus encourages us to depend upon his grace. He speaks, and it is done.</body></html>
