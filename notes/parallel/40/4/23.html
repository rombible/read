It tells of a vast amount of unrecorded teaching, varying in form, yet essentially the same--a call to repentance--the good news of a kingdom of heaven not far off--the witness, by act for the most part rather than words, that He was Himself the Head of that kingdom.<p><span class= "bld">Healing all manner of sickness.</span>--In the Greek, as in the English, sickness implies a less serious form of suffering than "disease," as the "torments" of the next verse imply, in their turn, something more acute. St. Matthew's first mention of our Lord's miracles cannot be read without interest. It will be seen that they are referred to, not directly as evidence of a supernatural mission, but almost, so to speak, as the natural accompaniments of His work; signs, not of power only or chiefly, but of the love, tenderness, pity, which were the true marks or "notes" of the kingdom of heaven. Restoration to outward health was at once the pledge that the Son of Man had not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them, and often, we cannot doubt, served to strengthen that faith in the love of the Father, some degree of which was all but invariably required as an antecedent condition of the miracle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-58.htm" title="And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.">Matthew 13:58</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-25.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">firstfruits of popular enthusiasm.</span> As on Christ's call a few followed him (vers. 20-22), so after his circuit in Galilee did crowds, from all parts of the Holy Land, also follow him (ver. 25), though less immediately and devotedly. As to these verses (23-25), notice - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Nearly all ver. 23 recurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-35.htm">Matthew 9:35</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Vers. 24, 25 occur in the parallels in different connexions. St. Mark places them in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7, 8</a>, after he has recorded details of many miracles which are found later in Matthew. St. Luke places them in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-17.htm">Matthew 6:17, 18</a>, immediately before the sermon on the mount (as in Matthew), but <span class="accented">after</span> the call of the Twelve. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> St. Matthew, therefore, did not arrange his Gospel with a sole regard to chronology. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The verses are clearly a summary of our Lord's work and influence in the early part of his ministry. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> Weiss ('Manual,' 2:277, etc.) considers that vers. 23 and 24 are a <span class="accented">heading</span> to the description of the teaching and healing activity of Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-25.htm">Matthew 4:25 - 9:34</a>), and that the repetition of ver. 23 in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-35.htm">Matthew 9:35</a> marks the heading of the next section (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36-14:12</a>). It is, indeed, remarkable that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-35.htm">Matthew 9:35</a> it occurs just before the definite setting apart of the twelve, and again that the phrase, "And seeing the multitudes," is found both in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-1.htm">Matthew 5:1</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>. Possibly the saying was part of the <span class="accented">original</span> setting of the two discourses, ch. 5-7. and ch. 10. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus went about all Galilee</span>; in <span class="accented">all Galilee</span> (Revised Version, with the manuscripts). This indicates, not so much systematic itineration round the cities in order (contrast the simple accusative in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-35.htm">Matthew 9:35</a> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-6.htm">Mark 6:6</a>]; 23. 15), as going hither and thither among them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-11.htm">Acts 13:11</a>). <span class="accented">All</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-34.htm">Matthew 8:34</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">Teaching... preaching... healing</span>. Our Lord, unlike the Baptist, takes men as and where he can find them; the religious, by teaching in the synagogues; the mass of people, by preaching, presumably in public places; the sick, by healing them wherever they are brought to him. Notice the threefold cord of all Christ-like ministry - teaching, especially those who have desires heavenwards; preaching, especially to the unconverted; healing, which cares for all physical life. <span class="cmt_word">Synagogues</span>. (For a detailed account, <span class="accented">vide</span> Schurer, II. 2. pp. 52, etc.; and for a short account, <span class="accented">vide</span> Keil, 'Arch.,' &sect; 30.) "The synagogues were places of assembly for public worship, where on sabbaths and feast-days (at a later period, also on the second and fifth days of the week) the people met together for prayer, and to listen to the reading of portions of the Old Testament, which were translated and explained in the vernacular dialect. With the permission of the president, any one who was fitted might deliver addresses" (Meyer). <span class="cmt_word">The gospel</span>. The first time it occurs in the text of St. Matthew. <span class="cmt_word">Of the kingdom</span>. The phrase is used thus absolutely only elsewhere in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-35.htm">Matthew 9:35</a> and Matthew 24:14 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a> is a false reading). This expression (with ver. 17, "Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand") is the earliest form of the message. The good news centred in the kingdom, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the realization of the position accepted by the nation at Sinai, with all that that involved, (<span class="accented">vide</span> Introduction, p. 23.). The phrase, "the gospel of the kingdom," refers only to the blessedness of its approach, and says nothing (unlike ver. 17)of the preparation for it. <span class="accented">Healing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). As compared with <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x1f71;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (rare in Matthew, in the active only <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-15.htm">Matthew 13:15</a>, which is from the LXX., but frequent in Luke) <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> thinks rather of the healer, who renders the service; <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x1f71;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, rather of the healed, the completeness of the cure (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-7.htm">Matthew 8:7, 8</a>), <span class="cmt_word">Sickness</span>; <span class="accented">disease</span>, Revised Version; <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, laying stress on the pain and disorder. Disease; <span class="accented">sickness</span>, Revised Version; <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, laying stress on the weakness. (For the two words in combination, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-15.htm">Deuteronomy 7:15</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Among the people</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1ff7;</span>). These words are wanting in the true text of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-35.htm">Matthew 9:35</a>. <span class="accented">The people</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Jews, as contrasted with those included in ver. 24. Not that St. Matthew means to exclude any sick Gentile who happened to be living among the Jews; but in this verse he is thinking only of those who lived near, and he naturally uses the word which connotes the <span class="accented">Jewish</span> people. If others came, it was only because they lived <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1ff7;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:23-25 Wherever Christ went, he confirmed his Divine mission by miracles, which were emblems of the healing power of his doctrine, and the influences of the Spirit which accompanied it. We do not now find the Saviour's miraculous healing power in our bodies; but if we are cured by medicine, the praise is equally his. Three general words are here used. He healed every sickness or disease; none was too bad; none too hard, for Christ to heal with a word. Three diseases are named; the palsy, which is the greatest weakness of the body; lunacy, which is the greatest malady of the mind; and possession of the devil, which is the greatest misery and calamity of both; yet Christ healed all, and by thus curing bodily diseases, showed that his great errand into the world was to cure spiritual maladies. Sin is the sickness, disease, and torment of the soul: Christ came to take away sin, and so to heal the soul.</body></html>
