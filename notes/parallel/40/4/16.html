That the reading of A was derived from the evangelist is unlikely, for the reading <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x1fb7;</span> must, at all events, have been before his time.

Christ will not stay long where he is not welcome. Those who are without Christ, are in the dark. They were sitting in this condition, a contented posture; they chose it rather than light; they were willingly ignorant. When the gospel comes, light comes; when it comes to any place, when it comes to any soul, it makes day there. Light discovers and directs; so does the gospel.
