Short as it was, it was in some sense the first parable in our Lord's teaching, the germ of an actual parable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-47.htm" title="Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:">Matthew 13:47</a>). It suggested a whole circle of thoughts. The sea is the troubled and evil world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-20.htm" title="But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.">Isaiah 57:20</a>), and the souls of men are the fish that have to be caught and taken from it, and the net is the Church of Christ. The figure had been used before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-16.htm" title="Behold, I will send for many fishers, said the LORD, and they shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.">Jeremiah 16:16</a>), but then it had presented its darker aspect, and the "fishers of men" were their captors and enslavers. The earliest extant hymn of the Church, by Clement of Alexandria, dwells on the image with a rich and suggestive playfulness. Christ is thus addressed:--<p>"Fisher of men, the blest,<p>Out of the world's unrest,<p>Out of sin's troubled sea<p>Taking us, Lord, to Thee;<p>Out of the waves of strife,<p>With bait of blissful life,<p>Drawing Thy nets to shore<p>With choicest fish, good store."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Follow me</span>; come <span class="accented">ye after me</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. There is no thought of continuous following from place to place (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) , but of immediate detachment from the present sphere of their interest and of attachment to Jesus as their leader. <span class="cmt_word">And I will make you fishers of men</span>; Mark, "to become fishers of men," laying more stress on the change in their character necessary for success in this new kind of fishing. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-10.htm">Luke 5:10</a> brings out the change in the nature of the work(<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="accented">Fishers.</span> The word suggests care, patience, skill, besides habits of life fitted for endurance of privation and fatigue. The same promise is, as it seems, related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-10.htm">Luke 5:10</a>, where notice: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It is connected with the miracle of the draught of fishes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It is not verbally identical with this: <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The words are addressed individually to Simon. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:18-22 When Christ began to preach, he began to gather disciples, who should be hearers, and afterwards preachers of his doctrine, who should be witnesses of his miracles, and afterwards testify concerning them. He went not to Herod's court, not to Jerusalem, among the chief priests and the elders, but to the sea of Galilee, among the fishermen. The same power which called Peter and Andrew, could have wrought upon Annas and Caiaphas, for with God nothing is impossible. But Christ chooses the foolish things of the world to confound the wise. Diligence in an honest calling is pleasing to Christ, and it is no hinderance to a holy life. Idle people are more open to the temptations of Satan than to the calls of God. It is a happy and hopeful thing to see children careful of their parents, and dutiful. When Christ comes, it is good to be found doing. Am I in Christ? is a very needful question to ask ourselves; and, next to that, Am I in my calling? They had followed Christ before, as common disciples, Joh 1:37; now they must leave their calling. Those who would follow Christ aright, must, at his command, leave all things to follow him, must be ready to part with them. This instance of the power of the Lord Jesus encourages us to depend upon his grace. He speaks, and it is done.</body></html>
