Here also we are in the region of the spiritual life, and must be content to leave the nature of the ministration undefined, instead of sensualising it as poets and artists have done. What is instructive is, that the help of their service, the contrast between the calm and beauty of their presence and that of the wild beasts and of the Tempter, comes as the reward of the abnegation which refused to make their ministry the subject of an experimental test. In this case, also, we find strange coincidences. The fact recorded by St. Matthew explains the words recorded by St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-51.htm" title="And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.">John 1:51</a>) as uttered but a few days later, and which speak of "the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man." The words with which St. Luke ends his record of the Temptation may well be noticed here: "And having finished every temptation, the devil departed from him for a season" (literally, <span class= "ital">till a season</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The conflict was not yet ended, and was from time to time renewed--now in the passionate prayer of the disciple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-22.htm" title="Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from you, Lord: this shall not be to you.">Matthew 16:22</a>), now in the open enmity of the prince of this world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-31.htm" title="Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.">John 12:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-30.htm" title="Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.">John 14:30</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The devil leaveth him</span>; Luke, "departed from him for a season." For though there are crises of temptation, the devil never finally gives up his attack while the object of it is still on earth. May not even direct assaults be included in the remarkable epitome of Messianic life found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-28.htm">Luke 22:28</a>? <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, angels came and ministered unto him</span>. Kept back before both by the presence of the evil one, and by the need for the God-Man to contend alone, they now came up to him and ministered to him so long as they could be helpful (for the change of tenses, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-15.htm">Matthew 8:15</a>). Mark however (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-13.htm">Mark 1:13</a>) implies that they had been present at other times than after this last crisis. <span class="accented">Ministered</span>; possibly supplying his bodily need (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-15.htm">Matthew 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-40.htm">Luke 10:40</a>); but as, after all, bodily sustenance is but secondary to spiritual, the latter must at least be included (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-43.htm">Luke 22:43</a> the "strengthening" would appear to be of his whole nature within and without, through the medium of his spirit. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-11 Concerning Christ's temptation, observe, that directly after he was declared to be the Son of God, and the Saviour of the world, he was tempted; great privileges, and special tokens of Divine favour, will not secure any from being tempted. But if the Holy Spirit witness to our being adopted as children of God, that will answer all the suggestions of the evil spirit. Christ was directed to the combat. If we presume upon our own strength, and tempt the devil to tempt us, we provoke God to leave us to ourselves. Others are tempted, when drawn aside of their own lust, and enticed, Jas 1:14; but our Lord Jesus had no corrupt nature, therefore he was tempted only by the devil. In the temptation of Christ it appears that our enemy is subtle, spiteful, and very daring; but he can be resisted. It is a comfort to us that Christ suffered, being tempted; for thus it appears that our temptations, if not yielded to, are not sins, they are afflictions only. Satan aimed in all his temptations, to bring Christ to sin against God. 1. He tempted him to despair of his Father's goodness, and to distrust his Father's care concerning him. It is one of the wiles of Satan to take advantage of our outward condition; and those who are brought into straits have need to double their guard. Christ answered all the temptations of Satan with It is written; to set us an example, he appealed to what was written in the Scriptures. This method we must take, when at any time we are tempted to sin. Let us learn not to take any wrong courses for our supply, when our wants are ever so pressing: in some way or other the Lord will provide. 2. Satan tempted Christ to presume upon his Father's power and protection, in a point of safety. Nor are any extremes more dangerous than despair and presumption, especially in the affairs of our souls. Satan has no objection to holy places as the scene of his assaults. Let us not, in any place, be off our watch. The holy city is the place, where he does, with the greatest advantage, tempt men to pride and presumption. All high places are slippery places; advancements in the world makes a man a mark for Satan to shoot his fiery darts at. Is Satan so well versed in Scripture as to be able to quote it readily? He is so. It is possible for a man to have his head full of Scripture notions, and his mouth full of Scripture expressions, while his heart is full of bitter enmity to God and to all goodness. Satan misquoted the words. If we go out of our way, out of the way of our duty, we forfeit the promise, and put ourselves out of God's protection. This passage, De 8:3, made against the tempter, therefore he left out part. This promise is firm and stands good. But shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? No. 3. Satan tempted Christ to idolatry with the offer of the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them. The glory of the world is the most charming temptation to the unthinking and unwary; by that men are most easily imposed upon. Christ was tempted to worship Satan. He rejected the proposal with abhorrence. Get thee hence, Satan! Some temptations are openly wicked; and they are not merely to be opposed, but rejected at once. It is good to be quick and firm in resisting temptation. If we resist the devil he will flee from us. But the soul that deliberates is almost overcome. We find but few who can decidedly reject such baits as Satan offers; yet what is a man profited if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Christ was succoured after the temptation, for his encouragement to go on in his undertaking, and for our encouragement to trust in him; for as he knew, by experience, what it was to suffer, being tempted, so he knew what it was to be succoured, being tempted; therefore we may expect, not only that he will feel for his tempted people, but that he will come to them with seasonable relief.</body></html>
