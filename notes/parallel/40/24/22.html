The warfare with foes outside the city, and the faction-fights and massacres within, would have caused an utter depopulation of the whole country.<p><span class= "bld">For the elect's sake.</span>--Those who, as believers in Jesus, were the "remnant" of the visible Israel, and therefore the true Israel of God. It was for the sake of the Christians of Judaea, not for that of the rebellious Jews, that the war was not protracted, and that Titus, under the outward influences of Josephus and Bernice, tempered his conquests with compassion (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xii. 3, ? 2; <span class= "ital">Wars,</span> vi. 9, ? 2). The new prominence which the idea of an election gains in our Lord's later teaching is every way remarkable. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-7.htm" title="Woe to the world because of offenses! for it must needs be that offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense comes!">Matthew 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-6.htm" title="And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and said to them, Why stand you here all the day idle?">Matthew 20:6</a>). The "call" had been wide; in those who received and obeyed it He taught men to recognise the "elect" whom God had chosen. Subtle questions as to whether the choice rested on foreknowledge or was absolutely arbitrary lay, if we may reverently so speak, outside the scope of His teaching.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Except these days should be shortened</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">had been</span> <span class="accented">shortened</span>). In the midst of wrath God thinks on mercy. He providentially ordained that the days of vengeance should not be indefinitely prolonged; the siege was practically of short duration, the country was not wholly overrun and desolated (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-23.htm">2 Kings 13:23</a>). The natural causes that combined to produce this shortening of the siege have been recounted by commentators. These were - the divided counsels of the Jews themselves, the voluntary surrender of parts of the fortifications, the fierce factions in the city, the destruction of magazines of provisions by calamitous fire, the suddenness of the arrival of Titus, and the fact that the walls had never been strengthened, as Herod Agrippa had intended. <span class="cmt_word">There should no flesh be saved;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the whole Jewish nation would have been annihilated. <span class="cmt_word">For the elect's sake.</span> At the intercession of the escaped Christians, who offered up unceasing prayer for their brethren and countrymen, God lessened the duration of the calamities. "The supplication of a righteous man availeth much in its working" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>). Ten righteous would have saved Sodom; Lot's intercession did preserve Zoar (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-13.htm">Isaiah 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-24.htm">Acts 27:24</a>). Some, not so suitably, explain "the elect" to be those Jews who should hereafter turn to the Lord; or the elect seed, "beloved for the fathers' sake" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-28.htm">Romans 11:28</a>). We may well believe that the local tribulations, such as are intimated by Daniel and Christ, and their limitation in time, are a picture of what shall happen in the last days, the intermediate fulfilment being the prelude of the final accomplishment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:4-28 The disciples had asked concerning the times, When these things should be? Christ gave them no answer to that; but they had also asked, What shall be the sign? This question he answers fully. The prophecy first respects events near at hand, the destruction of Jerusalem, the end of the Jewish church and state, the calling of the Gentiles, and the setting up of Christ's kingdom in the world; but it also looks to the general judgment; and toward the close, points more particularly to the latter. What Christ here said to his disciples, tended more to promote caution than to satisfy their curiosity; more to prepare them for the events that should happen, than to give a distinct idea of the events. This is that good understanding of the times which all should covet, thence to infer what Israel ought to do. Our Saviour cautions his disciples to stand on their guard against false teachers. And he foretells wars and great commotions among nations. From the time that the Jews rejected Christ, and he left their house desolate, the sword never departed from them. See what comes of refusing the gospel. Those who will not hear the messengers of peace, shall be made to hear the messengers of war. But where the heart is fixed, trusting in God, it is kept in peace, and is not afraid. It is against the mind of Christ, that his people should have troubled hearts, even in troublous times. When we looked forward to the eternity of misery that is before the obstinate refusers of Christ and his gospel, we may truly say, The greatest earthly judgments are but the beginning of sorrows. It is comforting that some shall endure even to the end. Our Lord foretells the preaching of the gospel in all the world. The end of the world shall not be till the gospel has done its work. Christ foretells the ruin coming upon the people of the Jews; and what he said here, would be of use to his disciples, for their conduct and for their comfort. If God opens a door of escape, we ought to make our escape, otherwise we do not trust God, but tempt him. It becomes Christ's disciples, in times of public trouble, to be much in prayer: that is never out of season, but in a special manner seasonable when we are distressed on every side. Though we must take what God sends, yet we may pray against sufferings; and it is very trying to a good man, to be taken by any work of necessity from the solemn service and worship of God on the sabbath day. But here is one word of comfort, that for the elect's sake these days shall be made shorter than their enemies designed, who would have cut all off, if God, who used these foes to serve his own purpose, had not set bounds to their wrath. Christ foretells the rapid spreading of the gospel in the world. It is plainly seen as the lightning. Christ preached his gospel openly. The Romans were like an eagle, and the ensign of their armies was an eagle. When a people, by their sin, make themselves as loathsome carcasses, nothing can be expected but that God should send enemies to destroy them. It is very applicable to the day of judgment, the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in that day, 2Th 2:1. Let us give diligence to make our calling and election sure; then may we know that no enemy or deceiver shall ever prevail against us.</body></html>
