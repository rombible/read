Over and above the joy of the beatific vision, or what is figured to us as the peace of Paradise, there will still be a work to be done, analogous to that which has been the man's training here, and in it there will be scope for all the faculties and energies that have been thus disciplined and developed. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-21.htm" title="His lord said to him, Well done, you good and faithful servant: you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter you into the joy of your lord.">Matthew 25:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-17.htm" title="And he said to him, Well, you good servant: because you have been faithful in a very little, have you authority over ten cities.">Luke 19:17</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall make him ruler over</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span>, with dative, denoting permanency of occupation; in ver. 45 it is with genitive, as of temporary superintendence) <span class="cmt_word">all his goods;</span> <span class="accented">all that he hath.</span> This is the reward. He who before was set over only a small part of his lord's possessions is now made superintendent of all his property; for "he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>). How we are to take this promise as applied to the rewards of the kingdom of heaven, we know not yet. "Eve hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive, what God hath prepared for them that love him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-9.htm">1 Corinthians 2:9</a>). There are similar mysterious statements elsewhere; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-26.htm">Revelation 2:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>. This may be one of those passages in which we are not meant to press or understand all the details of the parable. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:42-51 To watch for Christ's coming, is to maintain that temper of mind which we would be willing that our Lord should find us in. We know we have but a little time to live, we cannot know that we have a long time to live; much less do we know the time fixed for the judgment. Our Lord's coming will be happy to those that shall be found ready, but very dreadful to those that are not. If a man, professing to be the servant of Christ, be an unbeliever, covetous, ambitious, or a lover of pleasure, he will be cut off. Those who choose the world for their portion in this life, will have hell for their portion in the other life. May our Lord, when he cometh, pronounce us blessed, and present us to the Father, washed in his blood, purified by his Spirit, and fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.</body></html>
