Is it distinct from the coming of the Son of Man which here is so closely united with it? Men have given wildly conjectural answers to these questions, and have dreamt of the cross as appearing in the sky (as if the vision of Constantine were to be reproduced in the last days), or the lightning flash that shall dazzle all men with its brightness, or of some visible manifestation which none can imagine till it shall come. The vision of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a> supplies, it is believed, the true answer. The sign of the Son of Man is none other than the presence of the Son of Man Himself, coming in the clouds of heaven, in the ineffable glory of His majesty. And here, too, we must remember that we are still in the region of apocalyptic symbols. All such imagery falls short of the ultimate reality, and a "sign in heaven" is something more than a visible appearance in the sky.<p><span class= "bld">Then shall all the tribes of the earth.</span>--It lies in the nature of the case, that the "tribes" are those who have done evil, and who therefore dread the coming of the Judge. The words find their best comment in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-7.htm" title="Behold, he comes with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.">Revelation 1:7</a>, where St. John combines them freely with the prediction of <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm" title="And I will pour on the house of David, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look on me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.">Zechariah 12:10</a>, "They also which pierced Him," obviously including not only those who were sharers in the actual "piercing" of the crucified body of the Lord Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-37.htm" title="And again another scripture said, They shall look on him whom they pierced.">John 19:37</a>), but all who in any age "crucify the Son of God afresh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-6.htm" title="If they shall fall away, to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.">Hebrews 6:6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And then;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> after the great physical changes mentioned in the last verse. <span class="cmt_word">The sign of the Son of man.</span> This has been differently interpreted <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as the appearance of Christ himself in the clouds of heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13, 14</a>), when the glory and majesty of his advent will prove that he is Saviour and Judge. But this explanation seems to confuse the sign and that which it represents, the token of Messiah and Messiah himself who cometh afterward. And the definite article, "<span class="accented">the</span> sign," seems to imply something already well known to denote him, whereas his appearance could not be known beforehand. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> A star, which shall herald his second coming, as a star announced his birth. This, which is Olshausen's suggestion, is entirely arbitrary, and has nothing to support it, especially as the meaning of the star would not be directly intelligible to all men. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Meyer and De Wette suppose a bright light, or a kind of Shechinah. This, which doubtless will be manifested, was indeed a token of the presence of God, but could not be recognized at once as the sign of the Son of man. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> We come to what has been the almost universal interpretation of the Fathers and early commentators, who saw in the sign the cross of Christ, which is indeed the ensign and standard of the gospel. Nothing, equally with this, can characterize the Son of man, the emblem of his humiliation and his triumph. <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>. When they behold this sign in the sky, and know unmistakably that Christ in person is about to appear. <span class="cmt_word">Shall all the tribes of the earth mourn</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">shall beat the breast</span>). Not alone the Jews, looking on him whom they pierced, shall bewail their blindness and impenitence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>), but all the nations, the races and peoples who have rejected him whom they ought to have received. The cross shows that he died for them, though they profited not by his sacrifice (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15-17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They shall see</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>,, an echo of the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). The sign is followed by the advent of Christ in person. <span class="cmt_word">Coming in the clouds of heaven.</span> Some have taken "clouds" to mean angels, comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>; but them is no need for considering the term here to be metaphorical. The accompaniments of the theophanies are always thus announced (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a>). He thus claims to be the God of whom these words are continually used, and he leaves his hearers to gather that he will come visibly, not spiritually to individual souls or Churches, but manifestly to the whole of mankind, whether quick or risen. <span class="cmt_word">With power.</span> In his full omnipotence. <span class="accented">Cum virtute multa</span> (Vulgate). The expression must not be taken as denoting the attendant angels; they are named in the next verse. It denotes that he who on earth met with naught but pain and humiliation should be displayed to the same earth with that splendour and majesty which essentially belonged to him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:29-41 Christ foretells his second coming. It is usual for prophets to speak of things as near and just at hand, to express the greatness and certainty of them. Concerning Christ's second coming, it is foretold that there shall be a great change, in order to the making all things new. Then they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds. At his first coming, he was set for a sign that should be spoken against, but at his second coming, a sign that should be admired. Sooner or later, all sinners will be mourners; but repenting sinners look to Christ, and mourn after a godly sort; and those who sow in those tears shall shortly reap in joy. Impenitent sinners shall see Him whom they have pierced, and, though they laugh now, shall mourn and weep in endless horror and despair. The elect of God are scattered abroad; there are some in all places, and all nations; but when that great gathering day comes, there shall not one of them be missing. Distance of place shall keep none out of heaven. Our Lord declares that the Jews should never cease to be a distinct people, until all things he had been predicting were fulfilled. His prophecy reaches to the day of final judgment; therefore he here, ver. 34, foretells that Judah shall never cease to exist as a distinct people, so long as this world shall endure. Men of the world scheme and plan for generation upon generation here, but they plan not with reference to the overwhelming, approaching, and most certain event of Christ's second coming, which shall do away every human scheme, and set aside for ever all that God forbids. That will be as surprising a day, as the deluge to the old world. Apply this, first, to temporal judgments, particularly that which was then hastening upon the nation and people of the Jews. Secondly, to the eternal judgment. Christ here shows the state of the old world when the deluge came. They were secure and careless; they knew not, until the flood came; and they believed not. Did we know aright that all earthly things must shortly pass away, we should not set our eyes and hearts so much upon them as we do. The evil day is not the further off for men's putting it far from them. What words can more strongly describe the suddenness of our Saviour's coming! Men will be at their respective businesses, and suddenly the Lord of glory will appear. Women will be in their house employments, but in that moment every other work will be laid aside, and every heart will turn inward and say, It is the Lord! Am I prepared to meet him? Can I stand before him? And what, in fact, is the day of judgment to the whole world, but the day of death to every one?</body></html>
