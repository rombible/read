The whole period was, indeed, marked by tumults of this kind.<p><span class= "bld">Famines.</span>--Of these we know that of which Agabus prophesied (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-28.htm" title="And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.">Acts 11:28</a>), and which was felt severely, in the ninth year of Claudius, not only in Syria, but in Rome (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xx. 2). Suetonius (<span class= "ital">Claud.</span> c. 18) speaks of the reign of that emperor as marked by "continual scarcity."<p><span class= "bld">Pestilences.</span>--The word is not found in the best MSS., and has probably been inserted from the parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-11.htm" title="And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.">Luke 21:11</a>. It was, however, the inevitable attendant on famine, and the Greek words for the two (<span class= "greekheb">?????</span>, and <span class= "greekheb">??????</span>,<span class= "ital"> limos </span>and <span class= "ital">loimos</span>) were so like each other that the omission may possibly have been an error of transcription. A pestilence is recorded as sweeping off 30,000 persons at Rome (Sueton. <span class= "ital">Nero,</span> 39; Tacitus, <span class= "ital">Ann.</span> xvi. 13).<p><span class= "bld">Earthquakes, in divers places.</span>--Perhaps no period in the world's history has ever been so marked by these convulsions as that which intervenes between the Crucifixion and the destruction of Jerusalem. Josephus records one in Judaea (<span class= "ital">Wars,</span> iv. 4, ? 5); Tacitus tells of them in Crete, Rome, Apamea, Phrygia, Campania (<span class= "ital">Ann.</span> xii. 58; xiv. 27; xv. 22); Seneca (<span class= "ital">Ep.</span> 91), in A.D. 58, speaks of them as extending their devastations over Asia (the proconsular province, not the continent), Achaia, Syria, and Macedonia.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nation shall rise against nation,</span> etc. This part of the prediction is inapplicable to the era preceding the ruin of Jerusalem, the disturbances that occurred then (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> at Alexandria, Seleucia, Jamnia, and other localities mentioned by Josephus, 'Ant.,' 18:09. 8, 9; 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:17. 10; 18:1-8; 4:3. 2; and by Philo, 'Legat. ad Caium,' &sect; 30) could hardly have been indicated in such grand terms. More to the purpose is the sketch of the period given by Tacitus, at the opening of his history, though it embraces also details belonging to a somewhat later age: "I enter upon a work fertile in vicissitudes, stained with the blood of battles, embroiled with dissensions, horrible even in the intervals of peace. Four princes slain by the sword; three civil wars, more with foreign enemies, and sometimes both at once; prosperity in the East, disasters in the West; Illyricum disturbed; the Gauls ready to revolt; Britain conquered, and again lost; Sarmatians end Suevians conspiring against us; the Dacians renowned for defeats given and sustained; the Parthians almost aroused to arms by a counterfeit Nero. Italy afflicted with calamities unheard of, or recurring only after a long interval; cities overwhelmed or swallowed up in the fertile region of Campania; Rome itself laid waste by fire, the most ancient temples destroyed, the very capitol burned by its own citizens," etc. ('Hist.,' I. 2). But the Lord's words seem to refer to times when Rome's dominion had ceased, and nation warred against nation, as in later and modern days in Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa So again the prediction must be extended far beyond events in the Jewish cycle. <span class="cmt_word">Famines</span>. Besides the famine mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-28.htm">Acts 11:28</a>, there were others in Jerusalem and Judaea (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 3:15. 3; 20:2.6; 4. 2; 'Bell. Jud.,' yd. 3. 3). Suetonius ('Claud.,' 18) speaks of "assiduas sterilitates;" and Tacitus ('Ann.,' 12:43) records as happening at the same period, "frugum egestas, et orta ex eo fames." <span class="cmt_word">And pestilences;</span> as consequent on famine. Hence the Greek paronomasia, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, in our text. But many editors expunge <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, considering it, with some reason, to have been introduced from the parallel passage in St. Luke, where it is certainly genuine. Of pestilences we have notice in Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 4:06, 1), in Tacitus ('Ann.,' 14:16), and Suetonius ('Nero,' 39), where we read that at Rome in a single autumn thirty thousand persons perished. Wordsworth refers to Tertullian ('Apol.,' 20.), Who sees in these predictions infallible proof of the inspiration of Scripture. "Hence it is that we come to be so certain of many things not yet come to pass, from the experience we have of those that are; because those were presignified by the same Spirit with these which we see fulfilling every day" (Reeve). <span class="cmt_word">Earthquakes</span>. Commentators relate the occurrence of such commotions at Rome, in Crete, Laodicea, Campania, etc., and at Jerusalem (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 4:04. 5; Tacitus, 'Ann.,' 12:43, 58; 14:27; 15:22; Seneca, 'Ep.,' 91. 9; Philostraius, 'Vit. Apollon.,' 4:34; Zonaras, 'Ann.,' 11:10). Nosgen takes the term "earthquakes" in a metaphorical sense as equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, and implying mental perturbations; but it seems incongruous to admit a metaphysical prognostication in the midst of a notice of a series of material phenomena. <span class="cmt_word">In divers places;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">per loca</span> (Vulgate). Some render the words, "in all places," <span class="accented">ubivis locorum</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-41.htm">Luke 2:41</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "every year." But it is better to take the preposition distributively, "place by place," like <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>: so equivalent to "here and there." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:4-28 The disciples had asked concerning the times, When these things should be? Christ gave them no answer to that; but they had also asked, What shall be the sign? This question he answers fully. The prophecy first respects events near at hand, the destruction of Jerusalem, the end of the Jewish church and state, the calling of the Gentiles, and the setting up of Christ's kingdom in the world; but it also looks to the general judgment; and toward the close, points more particularly to the latter. What Christ here said to his disciples, tended more to promote caution than to satisfy their curiosity; more to prepare them for the events that should happen, than to give a distinct idea of the events. This is that good understanding of the times which all should covet, thence to infer what Israel ought to do. Our Saviour cautions his disciples to stand on their guard against false teachers. And he foretells wars and great commotions among nations. From the time that the Jews rejected Christ, and he left their house desolate, the sword never departed from them. See what comes of refusing the gospel. Those who will not hear the messengers of peace, shall be made to hear the messengers of war. But where the heart is fixed, trusting in God, it is kept in peace, and is not afraid. It is against the mind of Christ, that his people should have troubled hearts, even in troublous times. When we looked forward to the eternity of misery that is before the obstinate refusers of Christ and his gospel, we may truly say, The greatest earthly judgments are but the beginning of sorrows. It is comforting that some shall endure even to the end. Our Lord foretells the preaching of the gospel in all the world. The end of the world shall not be till the gospel has done its work. Christ foretells the ruin coming upon the people of the Jews; and what he said here, would be of use to his disciples, for their conduct and for their comfort. If God opens a door of escape, we ought to make our escape, otherwise we do not trust God, but tempt him. It becomes Christ's disciples, in times of public trouble, to be much in prayer: that is never out of season, but in a special manner seasonable when we are distressed on every side. Though we must take what God sends, yet we may pray against sufferings; and it is very trying to a good man, to be taken by any work of necessity from the solemn service and worship of God on the sabbath day. But here is one word of comfort, that for the elect's sake these days shall be made shorter than their enemies designed, who would have cut all off, if God, who used these foes to serve his own purpose, had not set bounds to their wrath. Christ foretells the rapid spreading of the gospel in the world. It is plainly seen as the lightning. Christ preached his gospel openly. The Romans were like an eagle, and the ensign of their armies was an eagle. When a people, by their sin, make themselves as loathsome carcasses, nothing can be expected but that God should send enemies to destroy them. It is very applicable to the day of judgment, the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in that day, 2Th 2:1. Let us give diligence to make our calling and election sure; then may we know that no enemy or deceiver shall ever prevail against us.</body></html>
