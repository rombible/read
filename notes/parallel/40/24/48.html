The words are memorable as implying the prescience, even in the immediate context of words that indicate nearness, that there would be what to men would seem delay. Those who looked on that delay as St. Peter looked on it would continue watchful, but the selfish and ungodly would be tempted by it to forget that Christ comes to men in more senses and more ways than one. The tyranny and sensuality which have at times stained the annals of the Church of Christ have had their origin in this forgetfulness, that though the final coming may be delayed, the Judge is ever near, even at the doors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-9.htm" title="Grudge not one against another, brothers, lest you be condemned: behold, the judge stands before the door.">James 5:9</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 48.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But and if</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>). "And" is a remnant of an old use of the word, meaning "it'," so that it is here redundant, and the translation should he simply, <span class="accented">but if</span>; <span class="accented">si autem. <span class="cmt_word"></span>That evil servant</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is in a sense the same as he who, in ver. 45, was regarded as faithful and prudent. The opposite case is here put; he is supposed to be wicked and untrustworthy; he no longer is always watching for his lord's coming and endeavouring to be always ready, because he knows that he may at any moment be called to account. <span class="cmt_word">My lord delayeth</span> [<span class="cmt_word">his</span> <span class="cmt_word">coming</span>]. B, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, and other good manuscripts omit <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> as unnecessary. Revised Version, <span class="accented">my lord tarrieth, he</span> brings himself to believe that the day of reckoning is still distant, and that he will have plenty of time to prepare his accounts before the settlement is called for. So men put off the day of repentance, saying, "Tomorrow, tomorrow," when they ought to feel that the present alone is theirs in which to prepare for judgment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:42-51 To watch for Christ's coming, is to maintain that temper of mind which we would be willing that our Lord should find us in. We know we have but a little time to live, we cannot know that we have a long time to live; much less do we know the time fixed for the judgment. Our Lord's coming will be happy to those that shall be found ready, but very dreadful to those that are not. If a man, professing to be the servant of Christ, be an unbeliever, covetous, ambitious, or a lover of pleasure, he will be cut off. Those who choose the world for their portion in this life, will have hell for their portion in the other life. May our Lord, when he cometh, pronounce us blessed, and present us to the Father, washed in his blood, purified by his Spirit, and fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.</body></html>
