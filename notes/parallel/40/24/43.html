It may be noted, however, that the variations in the three reports of this discourse indicate a comparatively free treatment of it, the natural result, probably, of its having been often reproduced, wholly or in part, orally before it was committed to writing. On ordinary grounds of evidence, St. Mark's report, assuming his connection with St. Peter, would seem likely to come nearest to the very words spoken by our Lord.<p><span class= "bld">The goodman of the house.</span>--Better, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-1.htm" title="For the kingdom of heaven is like to a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard.">Matthew 20:1</a>., <span class= "ital">householder.</span><p><span class= "bld">In what watch.</span>--The night-watches were four in number, of three hours each. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-38.htm" title="And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.">Luke 12:38</a>, we have "the second or the third watch" specified. The allusion to the "thief coming" would seem to have passed into the proverbial saying, that the day of the Lord would come "as a thief in the night," quoted by St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm" title="For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.">1Thessalonians 5:2</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But know this;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>: <span class="accented">illud autem scitote</span> (Vulgate); or, <span class="accented">this ye know.</span> The Lord draws particular attention to what he is going to say, which is a strange and startling truth in a parabolic form (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-39.htm">Luke 12:39</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The good man of the house;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">the master of the house</span>; <span class="accented">paterfamilias</span> (Vulgate). <span class="cmt_word">If... had known... he would have watched.</span> The form of the sentence (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;</span> with indicative in the protasis, and <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span> with indicative aorist in the apodosis) implies that the result did not happen. The master may have made all secure as far as bolts and bars were concerned, but he did not keep awake, though he had reason to know that a thief was in the neighbourhood, and so was not ready to frustrate any attack made in an unsuspected manner. <span class="cmt_word">To be broken up;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: <span class="accented">to be digged through</span>; <span class="accented">perfodi</span> (Vulgate). Houses constructed of sun-dried bricks, mud, or loose stones, could be easily pierced and entered without forcing shuttered window or barred door (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-16.htm">Job 24:16</a>). The significance of the parable is easy to see. The householder is the disciple of Christ, the thief is Christ himself, who comes on the unwatchful when and where they expect him not. It is, indeed, a strange comparison, but one calculated to alarm the unwary, and to show the necessity of the caution enjoined. Similar warnings are found elsewhere; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-3.htm">Revelation 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-15.htm">Revelation 16:15</a>. The exposition which regards the thief as the devil is not so suitable to the context. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:42-51 To watch for Christ's coming, is to maintain that temper of mind which we would be willing that our Lord should find us in. We know we have but a little time to live, we cannot know that we have a long time to live; much less do we know the time fixed for the judgment. Our Lord's coming will be happy to those that shall be found ready, but very dreadful to those that are not. If a man, professing to be the servant of Christ, be an unbeliever, covetous, ambitious, or a lover of pleasure, he will be cut off. Those who choose the world for their portion in this life, will have hell for their portion in the other life. May our Lord, when he cometh, pronounce us blessed, and present us to the Father, washed in his blood, purified by his Spirit, and fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.</body></html>
