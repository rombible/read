The form of punishment (one which, in its literal sense, belongs to the inventive cruelty of Eastern kings) would seem here to have been chosen for its figurative fitness. The man had been a hypocrite, double-minded, trying to serve two masters, and his Lord, with the sharp sword of judgment, smites through the false, apparent unity of his life, and reveals its duplicity.<p><span class= "bld">There shall be weeping.</span>--As elsewhere, "<span class= "ital">the</span> weeping and <span class= "ital">the</span> gnashing."<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall cut him asunder</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). This mode of death was inflicted in some cases (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-33.htm">1 Samuel 15:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-29.htm">Daniel 3:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37</a>; compare also the account of the execution of Mettius in Livy, 1:28; and Horace, 'Sat.,' I. 1:99). Thus in our own country "quartering," after hanging at least, was once a usual penalty for some offences, such as high treason. The term has been here interpreted to refer to the operation of the cruel scourge, which without metaphor might be said to cut a man to pieces; or "to dismiss from his employment," which seems to be hardly an adequate punishment. The difficulty is that the utter destruction of the malefactor implied in his literal cutting asunder is not consistent with his subsequent consignment to the lot of the hypocrites. Hence the Fathers have variously explained the term to signify separation from the company of saints, or from spiritual grace, or from all the blessings promised to the righteous. But we may take the Lord's words as applying first to temporal punishment - the unrighteous steward shall suffer death as horrible as dichotomy, a severance of body and soul, accompanied with unspeakable tortures; as in the History of Susanna, ver. 55, "The angel of God hath received the sentence of God to cut thee in two." <span class="cmt_word">Appoint him his portion with the hypocrites.</span> The Lord drops the parable, and speaks of the terrible reality. The hypocrites are the faithless and deceitful, who, while pretending to do their lord's work, are mere eye servants, and really neglect and injure it. The remissful steward shares their punishment in the other world. <span class="cmt_word">There</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">shall be,</span> etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the place where the hypocrites receive their punishment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-12.htm">Matthew 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-13.htm">Matthew 22:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-30.htm">Matthew 25:30</a>). The expression signifies measureless grief and despair. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:42-51 To watch for Christ's coming, is to maintain that temper of mind which we would be willing that our Lord should find us in. We know we have but a little time to live, we cannot know that we have a long time to live; much less do we know the time fixed for the judgment. Our Lord's coming will be happy to those that shall be found ready, but very dreadful to those that are not. If a man, professing to be the servant of Christ, be an unbeliever, covetous, ambitious, or a lover of pleasure, he will be cut off. Those who choose the world for their portion in this life, will have hell for their portion in the other life. May our Lord, when he cometh, pronounce us blessed, and present us to the Father, washed in his blood, purified by his Spirit, and fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.</body></html>
