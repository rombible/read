Nicom.</span> v. 5) as the character of one who has the passion of resentment under control, and who is therefore tranquil and untroubled, as in part determining the popular use of the word, and in part also explaining the beatitude.<p><span class= "bld">They shall inherit the earth.</span>--The words may be partly allusive to the "kingdom of the saints of the Most High" in that prophecy of Daniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-27.htm" title="And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.">Daniel 7:27</a>) which had done so much to fashion the Messianic expectations of the time. They have, however, a wider and continuous fulfilment. The influence of the meek and self-controlled is in the long-run greater than that of the impulsive and passionate. Their serenity helps them to find the maximum of true joy in all conditions of life; for to them the earth is not a stage for self-assertion and the graspings of desire, but an "inheritance" which they have received from their Father.<p>Many of the best MSS. invert the order of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-4.htm" title="Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.">Matthew 5:4-5</a>, and this arrangement has, at all events, the merit of bringing out the latent antithesis between the kingdom of heaven in its unseen greatness and the visible inheritance of the earth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed are the meek.</span> In this Beatitude our Lord still quotes Old Testament expressions. The phrase, "shall inherit the earth," comes even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>, only two verses before Isaiah 61:1, 2, to which he has already referred. In the present copies of the LXX. it is found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a>, but there it is evidently a corruption. It occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-9.htm">Psalm 37:9, 11, 22, 29, 34</a>; and since in the eleventh verse of the psalm it is directly said of the meek: "But the meek shall inherit the land (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span>)," it is, doubtless, from this latter passage that our Lord borrows the phrase. The meaning attributed by our Lord to the word <span class="accented">meek</span> is not clear. The ordinary use of the words <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x27;&#x1ffd;&#x3c2;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x27;&#x1ffd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, in the New Testament refers solely to the relation of men to men, and this is the sense in which <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> is taken by most commentators here. But with this sense, taken barely and solely, there seems to be no satisfactory explanation of the position of the Beatitude. Vers. 3 and 4 refer to men in their relation to God; ver. 6, to say the least, includes the relation of men to God; what has ver. 5 to do here if it refers solely to the relation of men to men? It would have come very naturally either before or after ver. 9 ("the peacemakers"); but why here? The reason, however, for the position of the Beatitude lies in the true conception of meekness. While the thought is here primarily that of meekness exhibited towards men (as is evident from the implied contrast <span class="accented">in they shall inherit the earth</span>), yet meekness towards men is closely connected with, and is the result of, meekness towards God. This is not exactly humility (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, which, as regards God, is equivalent to a sense of creatureliness or dependence; cf. Trench, 'Syn.,' &sect; 42.). Meekness is rather the attitude of the soul towards another when that other is in a state of activity towards it. It is the attitude of the disciple to the teacher when teaching; of the son to the father when exercising his paternal authority; of the servant to the master when giving him orders. It is therefore essentially as applicable to the relation of man to God as to that of man to man. It is for this reason that we find <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;</span>very frequently used of man's relation to God, in fact, more often than of man's relation to man; and this common meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;</span> must be specially remembered here, where the phrase is taken directly from the Old Testament. Weiss ('Matthaus-ev.') objects to Tholuck adducing the evidence of the Hebrew words, on the ground that the Greek terms are used solely of the relation to man, and that this usage is kept to throughout the New Testament. But the latter statement is hardly true. For, not to mention <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>, in which the reference is doubtful, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-21.htm">James 1:21</a> certainly refers to the meekness shown towards God in receiving his word. "The Scriptural <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>," says Trench, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>," is not in a man's outward behaviour only; nor yet in his relations to his fellow-men; as little in his mere natural disposition. Rather is it an inwrought grace of the soul; and the exercises of it are first and chiefly towards God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-21.htm">James 1:21</a>). It is that temper of spirit in which we accept his dealings with us as good, and therefore without disputing or resisting; and it is closely linked with the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, and follows directly upon it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-12.htm">Zephaniah 3:12</a>), because it is only the humble heart which is also the meek; and which, as such, does not fight against God, and more or less struggle and contend with him." Yet, as this meekness must be felt towards God not only in his <span class="accented">direct</span> dealings with the soul, but also in his <span class="accented">indirect</span> dealings (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> by secondary means and agents), it must also be exhibited towards men. Meekness towards God necessarily issues in meekness towards men. Our Lord's concise teaching seizes, therefore, on this furthest expression of meekness. Thus it is not meekness in the relation of man to man barely staled, of which Christ here speaks, but meekness in the relation of man to man, with its prior and presupposed fact of meekness in the relation of man to God. <span class="cmt_word">Shall inherit the earth.</span> In the Psalm this is equivalent to the land of Palestine, and the psalmist means that, though the wicked may have temporary power, yet God's true servants shall really and finally have dominion in the land. But what is intended here? Probably our Lord's audience understood the phrase on his lips as a Messianic adaptation of the original meaning, and as therefore implying that those who manifested a meek reception of his will would obtain that full possession of the land of Palestine which was now denied to the Israelites through the conquest of the Romans. But to our Lord, and to the evangelist who, years after, recorded them, the meaning of the words must have been much fuller, corresponding, in fact, to the true meaning of the "kingdom of heaven," viz. that the meek <span class="accented">shall inherit</span> - shall receive, as their rightful possession from their Father, the whole earth; renewed, it may be (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>), but still the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>), with all the powers of nature therein implied. Of this the conquest of nature already gained through the civilization produced under Christianity is at once the promise and, though but in a small degree, the firstfruits. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:3-12 Our Saviour here gives eight characters of blessed people, which represent to us the principal graces of a Christian. 1. The poor in spirit are happy. These bring their minds to their condition, when it is a low condition. They are humble and lowly in their own eyes. They see their want, bewail their guilt, and thirst after a Redeemer. The kingdom of grace is of such; the kingdom of glory is for them. 2. Those that mourn are happy. That godly sorrow which worketh true repentance, watchfulness, a humble mind, and continual dependence for acceptance on the mercy of God in Christ Jesus, with constant seeking the Holy Spirit, to cleanse away the remaining evil, seems here to be intended. Heaven is the joy of our Lord; a mountain of joy, to which our way is through a vale of tears. Such mourners shall be comforted by their God. 3. The meek are happy. The meek are those who quietly submit to God; who can bear insult; are silent, or return a soft answer; who, in their patience, keep possession of their own souls, when they can scarcely keep possession of anything else. These meek ones are happy, even in this world. Meekness promotes wealth, comfort, and safety, even in this world. 4. Those who hunger and thirst after righteousness are happy. Righteousness is here put for all spiritual blessings. These are purchased for us by the righteousness of Christ, confirmed by the faithfulness of God. Our desires of spiritual blessings must be earnest. Though all desires for grace are not grace, yet such a desire as this, is a desire of God's own raising, and he will not forsake the work of his own hands. 5. The merciful are happy. We must not only bear our own afflictions patiently, but we must do all we can to help those who are in misery. We must have compassion on the souls of others, and help them; pity those who are in sin, and seek to snatch them as brands out of the burning. 6. The pure in heart are happy; for they shall see God. Here holiness and happiness are fully described and put together. The heart must be purified by faith, and kept for God. Create in me such a clean heart, O God. None but the pure are capable of seeing God, nor would heaven be happiness to the impure. As God cannot endure to look upon their iniquity, so they cannot look upon his purity. 7. The peace-makers are happy. They love, and desire, and delight in peace; and study to be quiet. They keep the peace that it be not broken, and recover it when it is broken. If the peace-makers are blessed, woe to the peace-breakers! 8. Those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake are happy. This saying is peculiar to Christianity; and it is more largely insisted upon than any of the rest. Yet there is nothing in our sufferings that can merit of God; but God will provide that those who lose for him, though life itself, shall not lose by him in the end. Blessed Jesus! how different are thy maxims from those of men of this world! They call the proud happy, and admire the gay, the rich, the powerful, and the victorious. May we find mercy from the Lord; may we be owned as his children, and inherit his kingdom. With these enjoyments and hopes, we may cheerfully welcome low or painful circumstances.</body></html>
