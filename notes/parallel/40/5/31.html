The words of the precept were vague--"If she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her," and the two school of casuists took opposite views of its meaning. The stricter party of Shammai held that the "uncleanness" meant simply unchastity before or after marriage. The followers of Hillel held, on the other hand (as Milton among Christian teachers), that anything that made the company of the wife distasteful was a sufficient ground for repudiation. Even a moralist generally so pure and noble as the son of Sirach, took in this matter the laxer view--"If she go not as thou wouldest have her, cut her off from thy flesh, and give her a bill of divorce, and let her go" (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/25-26.htm" title="If she go not as thou wouldest have her, cut her off from thy flesh, and give her a bill of divorce, and let her go.">Ecclesiasticus 25:26</a>). It is noteworthy that our Lord, whose teaching, especially as regards the Sabbath question, might have been, for the most part, claimed by the school of Hillel, on this matter of divorce stamps the impress of His approval on the teaching of his rival.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31, 32.</span> - <span class="accented">Divorce.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - Here only. <span class="cmt_word">It hath been said</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>). This is the only one of the six examples to which our Lord does not prefix "ye have heard," and inserts <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>. Hence Lightfoot ('Hor.

But it must be done. Every thing is bestowed to save us from our sins, not in them. All our senses and powers must be kept from those things which lead to transgression. Those who lead others into temptation to sin, by dress or in other ways, or leave them in it, or expose them to it, make themselves guilty of their sin, and will be accountable for it. If painful operations are submitted to, that our lives may be saved, what ought our minds to shrink from, when the salvation of our souls is concerned? There is tender mercy under all the Divine requirements, and the grace and consolations of the Spirit will enable us to attend to them.</body></html>
