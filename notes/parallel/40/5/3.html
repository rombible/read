Here the blessedness is that of those who, whatever their outward state may be, are in their inward life as those who feel that they have nothing of their own, must be receivers before they give, must be dependent on another's bounty, and be, as it were, the "bedesmen" of the great King. To that temper of mind belongs the "kingdom of heaven," the eternal realities, in this life and the life to come, of that society of which Christ is the Head. Things are sometimes best understood by their contraries, and we may point to the description of the church of Laodicea as showing us the opposite type of character, thinking itself "rich" in the spiritual life, when it is really as "the pauper," destitute of the true riches, blind and naked.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3</span> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-27.htm">Matthew 7:27</a>. - THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT.

The word describes "the poor in spirit," etc., not as recipients of blessing (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) from God, or even from men, but as possessors of "happiness" (cf. the Authorized Version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-17.htm">John 13:17</a>, and frequently). It describes them in reference to their inherent state, not to the gifts or the rewards that they receive. It thus answers in thought to the common <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;</span> of the Old Testament; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-8.htm">1 Kings 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-5.htm">Psalm 84:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs, is the kingdom of heaven.</span> The first Beatitude is the sum and substance of the whole sermon. Poverty of spirit stands in contrast to self sufficiency (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a>) and as such is perhaps the quality which is most of all opposed to the Jewish temper in all ages (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17-20</a>). For in this, as in much else, the Jewish nation is the type of the human race since the Fall. Observe that vers. 3, 4 (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, possibly also ver. 5, <span class="accented">vide infra</span>) recall <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1, 2</a>. As recently in the synagogue at Nazareth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18, 19</a>), so also here, he bases the explanation of his work on the prophecy of that work in the Book of Isaiah. The poor (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>). <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, in classical and philosophical usage, implies a lower degree of poverty than <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-9.htm">2 Corinthians 9:9</a> and LXX.). "The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> may be so poor that he earns his bread by daily labour; but the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is so poor that he only obtains his living by begging The <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> has nothing superfluous, the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> nothing at all" (Trench, 'Syn.,' &sect; 36.). Hence Tertullian ('Adv. Marc.,' 4:14; cf. 15)purposely altered <span class="accented">Beati pauperes</span> of the Old Latin to <span class="accented">Beati mendici</span>, and elsewhere ('De Idol.,' 12) rendered it by <span class="accented">egeni.</span> But in Hellenistic Greek, so far as the usage of the LXX. and the Hexapla goes (<span class="accented">vide</span> Hatch, 'Biblical Greek,' p. 73), the distinction seems hardly to hold good. Hatch even infers - on, we think, very insufficient premisses - that these two words, with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> (but <span class="accented">vide infra</span>), designate the poor of an oppressed country, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the peasantry, the <span class="accented">fellahin</span> of Palestine as a class, and he considers it probable that this special meaning underlies the use of the words in these verses. Whether this be the case or not, the addition of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> completely excludes the supposition that our <span class="accented">Lord</span> meant to refer to any merely external circumstances. <span class="accented">In spirit</span>; Matthew only (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>). Dative of sphere (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-34.htm">1 Corinthians 7:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-11.htm">Romans 12:11</a>). <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-5.htm">James 2:5</a> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;</span>) forms an apparent rather than a real contrast; for the dative there marks, not the sphere in which, but the object with reference to which, the poverty is felt ("the poor as to the world," Revised Version; Wiesinger in Huther), or possibly the object which is the standard of comparison, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the judgment of the world (Winer, &sect; 31:4, <span class="accented">a</span>). Christ here affirms the blessedness of those who are in their spirit absolutely devoid of wealth. It cannot mean that they are this in God's opinion, for in God's opinion all are so. It means, therefore, that they are this in their own opinion. While many feel in themselves a wealth of soul-satisfaction, these do not, but realize their insufficiency. Christ says that they realize this "in (their) spirit;" for the spirit is that part of us which specially craves for satisfaction, and which is the means by which we lay hold of true satisfaction. The actual craving for spiritual wealth is not mentioned in this verse. It is implied, but direct mention of it comes partly in ver. 4, and especially in ver. 6. <span class="accented">For theirs.</span> Emphatic, as in all the Beatitudes (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>,). <span class="accented">Is.</span> Not hereafter (Meyer), but even already. <span class="accented">The kingdom of heaven</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> note, p. 150). The poor in spirit already belong to and have a share in that realm of God which now is realized chiefly in relation to our spirit, but ultimately will be realized in relation to every element of our nature, and to all other persons, and to every part, animate and inanimate, of the whole world. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:3-12 Our Saviour here gives eight characters of blessed people, which represent to us the principal graces of a Christian. 1. The poor in spirit are happy. These bring their minds to their condition, when it is a low condition. They are humble and lowly in their own eyes. They see their want, bewail their guilt, and thirst after a Redeemer. The kingdom of grace is of such; the kingdom of glory is for them. 2. Those that mourn are happy. That godly sorrow which worketh true repentance, watchfulness, a humble mind, and continual dependence for acceptance on the mercy of God in Christ Jesus, with constant seeking the Holy Spirit, to cleanse away the remaining evil, seems here to be intended. Heaven is the joy of our Lord; a mountain of joy, to which our way is through a vale of tears. Such mourners shall be comforted by their God. 3. The meek are happy. The meek are those who quietly submit to God; who can bear insult; are silent, or return a soft answer; who, in their patience, keep possession of their own souls, when they can scarcely keep possession of anything else. These meek ones are happy, even in this world. Meekness promotes wealth, comfort, and safety, even in this world. 4. Those who hunger and thirst after righteousness are happy. Righteousness is here put for all spiritual blessings. These are purchased for us by the righteousness of Christ, confirmed by the faithfulness of God. Our desires of spiritual blessings must be earnest. Though all desires for grace are not grace, yet such a desire as this, is a desire of God's own raising, and he will not forsake the work of his own hands. 5. The merciful are happy. We must not only bear our own afflictions patiently, but we must do all we can to help those who are in misery. We must have compassion on the souls of others, and help them; pity those who are in sin, and seek to snatch them as brands out of the burning. 6. The pure in heart are happy; for they shall see God. Here holiness and happiness are fully described and put together. The heart must be purified by faith, and kept for God. Create in me such a clean heart, O God. None but the pure are capable of seeing God, nor would heaven be happiness to the impure. As God cannot endure to look upon their iniquity, so they cannot look upon his purity. 7. The peace-makers are happy. They love, and desire, and delight in peace; and study to be quiet. They keep the peace that it be not broken, and recover it when it is broken. If the peace-makers are blessed, woe to the peace-breakers! 8. Those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake are happy. This saying is peculiar to Christianity; and it is more largely insisted upon than any of the rest. Yet there is nothing in our sufferings that can merit of God; but God will provide that those who lose for him, though life itself, shall not lose by him in the end. Blessed Jesus! how different are thy maxims from those of men of this world! They call the proud happy, and admire the gay, the rich, the powerful, and the victorious. May we find mercy from the Lord; may we be owned as his children, and inherit his kingdom. With these enjoyments and hopes, we may cheerfully welcome low or painful circumstances.</body></html>
