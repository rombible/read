It is not the passing glance, not even the momentary impulse of desire, but the continued gaze by which the impulse is deliberately cherished till it becomes a passion. This noble and beautiful teaching, it has often been remarked, and by way of disparagement, is found elsewhere. Such disparagement is out of place. By the mercy of God the Light that "lighteth every man" has led men to recognise the truth thus asserted, and parallels to it may be found in the writings of Conlucius, Seneca, Epictetus, and even of the Jewish Rabbis themselves. The words of Juvenal closely express the general sentiment:--<p>" Scelus intra se tacitus qui cogitat ullum,<p>Facti crimen habet."<p>["Who in his breast a guilty thought doth cherish,<p>He bears the guilt of action."]<p>Our Lord's words speak primarily of <span class= "ital">"</span>adultery," but are, of course, applicable to every form of sensual impurity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I say</span> (ver. 22, note). The bare command forbidding an external action is insufficient. It must extend to the thought. Contrast Josephus ('Ant.,' 12:09. 1), "The purposing to do a thing, without actually doing it, is not worthy of punishment." Generally, however, the sinfulness of wrong thoughts must have been acknowledged (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>, and the tenth commandment; cf. late examples in Schott-gen). Hammond ('Pr. Cat.,' in Ford) says, "In the Law, the fastening of the eyes on an idol, considering the beauty of it, saith Maimonides, is forbidden (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-4.htm">Leviticus 19:4</a>), and not only the worship of it" (<span class="accented">vide</span> Maimonides, 'Hilk. Ab. Zar.,' 2:2, by whom, however, the thought is, perhaps, rather condemned for what it leads to than per <span class="accented">se</span>; and similarly with <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-1.htm">Job 31:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-25.htm">Proverbs 6:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">every one who</span> (ver. 22, note). <span class="cmt_word">Looketh... to lust after</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). As <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;</span> with the infinitive (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1</a>), primarily denotes purpose; this may be equivalent to "looketh in order that he may lust, looketh to stimulate his lust" (cf. Meyer, Trench); but, as Weiss points out, this surely belongs to the refinement, not to the beginning of sin. Hence Nosgen <span class="accented">suggests</span> "<span class="accented">looketh</span>... lustfully" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-5.htm">James 4:5</a>). Probably this is one of those cases where, as Ellicott says on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-18.htm">1 Corinthians 9:18</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;</span> with the infinitive has "<span class="accented">a</span> shade of meaning that seems to lie between <span class="accented">purpose</span> and <span class="accented">result</span>, and even sometimes to approximate to the latter." At all events, it does not express, as <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;</span> would have expressed, the <span class="accented">immediate</span> purpose of the look (<span class="accented">vide</span> Ellicott, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Her</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, B, D, etc.); accusative with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, here only in the New Testament. Perhaps the pronoun should be omitted, with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:27-32 Victory over the desires of the heart, must be attended with painful exertions. But it must be done. Every thing is bestowed to save us from our sins, not in them. All our senses and powers must be kept from those things which lead to transgression. Those who lead others into temptation to sin, by dress or in other ways, or leave them in it, or expose them to it, make themselves guilty of their sin, and will be accountable for it. If painful operations are submitted to, that our lives may be saved, what ought our minds to shrink from, when the salvation of our souls is concerned? There is tender mercy under all the Divine requirements, and the grace and consolations of the Spirit will enable us to attend to them.</body></html>
