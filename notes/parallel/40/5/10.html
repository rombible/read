The work of the peacemakers is not a light and easy work. Often, as of old, when we "labour for peace," men "make them ready for battle" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-7.htm" title="I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.">Psalm 120:7</a>); but not the less is the blessing sure to follow. Amid seeming failure or seeming success, those who are persecuted, not for opinions, but for right conduct, the true martyrs and confessors of righteousness, attain their reward at last. There is something suggestive in the fact that the last promise is the same as the first. We end, as we began, with "the kingdom of heaven;" but the path by which we have been led leads us to see that that includes all the intermediate blessings, of which at first it seemed but the prelude and beginning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which are persecuted</span>; <span class="accented">which have</span> been persecuted (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. "Those who are harassed, hunted, spoiled. The term is properly used of wild beasts pursued by hunters, or of an enemy or malefactor in flight" (Wetstein). Our Lord, by the use of the perfect, wishes to indicate <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the fact that they have endured persecution, and still stand firm; and probably <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the condition of temporal loss to which they have been reduced by such persecution. They have "suffered the loss," possibly, "of all things," but they are "blessed." <span class="cmt_word">For righteouness' sake</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>). No article (contrast ver. 6), either as indicating that for even a part of righteousness persecution can be undergone, or, and more probably, simply dwelling on the cause of persecution without idealizing it. St. Peter also says, perhaps with a reference to our Lord's words, that they who suffer <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> are <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-14.htm">1 Peter 3:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For theirs is the kingdom of heaven</span>. The same promise that was given to "the poor in spirit" (ver. 3) is here given to the persecuted for righteousness' sake. In the former case, poverty in the sphere of the spirit obtains the fullest possessions; here the same promise is given to temporal loss produced by faithfulness to the cause of righteousness. In ver. 3 our Lord removed all occasion for intellectual and spiritual pride. Here he comforts for temporal and social losses (cf. especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-10.htm">2 Corinthians 6:10</a>; further see ver. 3, note). Clement of Alexandria, '<span class="accented">Strom.</span>,' 4:6 (p. 582, Potter) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> confuses this and the preceding Beatitude; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> gives a curious reading of some who alter the Gospels: "Blessed are they who have been persecuted through righteousness (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>), for they shall be perfect; and blessed are they who have been persecuted for my sake, for they shall have a place where they shall not be persecuted" (cf. Westcott, 'Introd. Gospp.,' Appendix C). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:3-12 Our Saviour here gives eight characters of blessed people, which represent to us the principal graces of a Christian. 1. The poor in spirit are happy. These bring their minds to their condition, when it is a low condition. They are humble and lowly in their own eyes. They see their want, bewail their guilt, and thirst after a Redeemer. The kingdom of grace is of such; the kingdom of glory is for them. 2. Those that mourn are happy. That godly sorrow which worketh true repentance, watchfulness, a humble mind, and continual dependence for acceptance on the mercy of God in Christ Jesus, with constant seeking the Holy Spirit, to cleanse away the remaining evil, seems here to be intended. Heaven is the joy of our Lord; a mountain of joy, to which our way is through a vale of tears. Such mourners shall be comforted by their God. 3. The meek are happy. The meek are those who quietly submit to God; who can bear insult; are silent, or return a soft answer; who, in their patience, keep possession of their own souls, when they can scarcely keep possession of anything else. These meek ones are happy, even in this world. Meekness promotes wealth, comfort, and safety, even in this world. 4. Those who hunger and thirst after righteousness are happy. Righteousness is here put for all spiritual blessings. These are purchased for us by the righteousness of Christ, confirmed by the faithfulness of God. Our desires of spiritual blessings must be earnest. Though all desires for grace are not grace, yet such a desire as this, is a desire of God's own raising, and he will not forsake the work of his own hands. 5. The merciful are happy. We must not only bear our own afflictions patiently, but we must do all we can to help those who are in misery. We must have compassion on the souls of others, and help them; pity those who are in sin, and seek to snatch them as brands out of the burning. 6. The pure in heart are happy; for they shall see God. Here holiness and happiness are fully described and put together. The heart must be purified by faith, and kept for God. Create in me such a clean heart, O God. None but the pure are capable of seeing God, nor would heaven be happiness to the impure. As God cannot endure to look upon their iniquity, so they cannot look upon his purity. 7. The peace-makers are happy. They love, and desire, and delight in peace; and study to be quiet. They keep the peace that it be not broken, and recover it when it is broken. If the peace-makers are blessed, woe to the peace-breakers! 8. Those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake are happy. This saying is peculiar to Christianity; and it is more largely insisted upon than any of the rest. Yet there is nothing in our sufferings that can merit of God; but God will provide that those who lose for him, though life itself, shall not lose by him in the end. Blessed Jesus! how different are thy maxims from those of men of this world! They call the proud happy, and admire the gay, the rich, the powerful, and the victorious. May we find mercy from the Lord; may we be owned as his children, and inherit his kingdom. With these enjoyments and hopes, we may cheerfully welcome low or painful circumstances.</body></html>
