From the worship of the synagogue it passed into that of the Christian Church, and by the time the Gospels were written had become so familiar that it was used without hesitation by all the Evangelists, sometimes singly, sometimes (uniformly in St. John) with the emphasis of reduplication.<p><span class= "bld">Till heaven and earth pass.</span>--The formula was probably one in common use by our Lord to express the unchangeableness of the divine word. It was afterwards used, we must remember, by our Lord, with even augmented force, in reference to His own words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-35.htm" title="Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.">Matthew 24:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-31.htm" title="Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.">Mark 13:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-33.htm" title="Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.">Luke 21:33</a>).<p><span class= "bld">One jot or one tittle.</span>--The "jot" is the Greek <span class= "ital">iota</span> (0, the Hebrew <span class= "ital">yod </span>(')<span class= "ital">,</span> the smallest of all the letters of the alphabet. The "tittle" was one of the smaller strokes, or twists of other letters, such, e.g., as distinguished <span class= "greekheb"></span> (D) from <span class= "greekheb"></span> (R), or <span class= "greekheb"></span> (K) from <span class= "greekheb"></span> (B). Jewish Rabbis used to caution their scholars against so writing as to cause one letter to be mistaken for another, and to give examples of passages from the Law in which such a mistake would turn a divine truth into nonsense or blasphemy. The <span class= "ital">yod</span> in its turn was equally important. It distinguished Joshua from Hoshea, Sarai from Sarah. The Jews had indeed a strange legend that its insertion in the former name was given as a compensation for its exclusion from the latter. The meaning is obvious enough," Nothing truly belonging to the Law, however seemingly trivial, shall drift away and be forgotten until it has done all that it was meant to do."<p><span class= "bld">Till all be fulfilled.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Till all things have come to pass.</span> The words in the English version suggest an identity with the "fulfil" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-17.htm" title="Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.">Matthew 5:17</a>, which is not found in the Greek. The same formula is used in the Greek of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-34.htm" title="Truly I say to you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.">Matthew 24:34</a>. The "all things" in both cases are the great facts of our Lord's life, death, resurrection, and the establishment of the kingdom of God. So taken, we find that the words do not assert, as at first they seem to do, the perpetual obligation even of the details of the Law, but the limit up to which the obligation was to last; and they are therefore not inconsistent with the words which speak of the system of the Law as a whole as "decaying and waxing old, and ready to vanish away" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-13.htm" title="In that he said, A new covenant, he has made the first old. Now that which decays and waxes old is ready to vanish away.">Hebrews 8:13</a>). The two "untils" have each of them their significance. Each "jot" or "tittle "must first complete its work; then, and not till then, will it pass away.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-17.htm">Luke 16:17</a>, "But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the Law to fail" (Revised Version). The words are so similar that the two evangelists probably record the same utterance, the difference in the form of the sentence pointing rather to an oral than a written common source. St. Luke places it in an attack on the Pharisees, who had scoffed at our Lord for his parable of the dishonest steward. <span class="cmt_word">Verily</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5df;</span>, literally, "established," "sure"). It has hardly been sufficiently noticed by commentators that the New Testament usage of the word "Amen" often slightly differs from that found in the Old Testament. "Amen" in the Old Testament always involves the personal acceptance of the statement to which it refers ("so be it"), whether this be a statement upon oath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-22.htm">Numbers 5:22</a>, perhaps), or a statement of penalties incurred under certain circumstances (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-22.htm">Numbers 5:22</a>, probably; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-13.htm">Nehemiah 5:13</a>); or a statement expressing a pious hope uttered either by another (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-36.htm">1 Kings 1:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-6.htm">Jeremiah 28:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-5.htm">Jeremiah 11:5</a> (?); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-6.htm">Nehemiah 8:6</a>; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-16.htm">1 Corinthians 14:16</a>); or by one's self (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-13.htm">Psalm 41:13</a>). Hence the LXX. either leaves it untranslated or, with but one exception, translates it by <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. In Hellenistic Greek, however, it became often used as little more than a mere asseveration ("verily"). The earliest trace of this usage is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-6.htm">Jeremiah 28:6</a>, where the LXX. renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5df;</span>by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> (Aquila much better <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, though generally elsewhere <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), and it is frequent in the New Testament, cf. especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-27.htm">Luke 9:27</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, with parallels, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-44.htm">Luke 12:44</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-47.htm">Matthew 24:47</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-3.htm">Luke 21:3</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-43.htm">Mark 12:43</a>). Yet this usage of "Amen" in Hellenistic Greek does not seem to have ever spread into Hebrew or Aramaic. W. H. Lowe ('Fragm. Pesach.,' p. 70) says, and apparently truly, "The Jews never used 'amen in the sense of 'verily.' They say <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5ea;</span>, <span class="accented">be'emeth</span>', 'in truth,' <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="accented">hemanutha</span>, 'Faith!' or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5e0;&#x5dd;</span>, '<span class="accented">omnam</span>, 'verily.'" If so, the fact is interesting, for it implies that, notwithstanding the usage of "Amen" in Greek, our Lord himself, as speaking Aramaic, probably did not use it in the mere sense of strong asseveration, but rather always with its connotation of his entire concurrence in the statement he was making. In his mouth, that is to say, it always emphasized the thought of his personal acceptance of the statement with its legitimate issue. Observe that it makes no difference (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-6.htm">Jeremiah 28:6</a>) whether the "Amen" comes at the beginning or at the end of his utterance. N.B. - <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-51.htm">Luke 11:51</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-36.htm">Matthew 23:36</a>) may be taken as intermediate between <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> states a truth; <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> assents with the intellect; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, in at least Hebrew and Aramaic usage, accepts it with all its consequences (cf <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-19.htm">2 Corinthians 1:19, 20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Till heaven and earth pass</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">pass away</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1fc3;</span>); and so in the next clause. The same almost archaic sense of "pass" recurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-6.htm">Psalm 148:6</a>, Authorized Version (Revised Version, "pass away"). Observe that our Lord does not say that the Law will then pass away. He says, not till then; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he affirms, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-17.htm">Luke 16:17</a>, that it is <span class="accented">easier</span> for heaven and earth to pass away than for the Law. For, in fact, as being constantly fulfilled in its ideal and therefore permanent character, it must necessarily remain in the new world; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-25.htm">1 Peter 1:25</a> (the everlasting duration of the word of the Lord); <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:13</a> (love); <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a> (righteousness); cf. Meyer. The belief in the permanence of the Law which the Jews had (<span class="accented">vide</span> references in Meyer, and especially Weber, 'Altsynag. Theol.,' &sect;&sect; 5, 84) here finds its true satisfaction. "The least element of holiness which the Law contains has more reality and durability than the whole visible universe" (Godet on Luke). Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-31.htm">Mark 13:31</a>, "My words shall not pass away" - a claim only seen in its full three when put beside these words about the Law. <span class="cmt_word">One jot</span>. The permanence of even every <span class="accented">yod</span> (<span class="accented">y</span>, <span class="accented">j</span>), though the smallest letter of the Hebrew alphabet, is not infrequently referred to by Jewish writers (cf. <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in Lightfoot, 'Hor. Hebr.;' Edersheim, 'Life,' 1.537). Observe: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The mention of <span class="accented">yod</span>, evidently because of its small size, is one proof of the fact that the Hebrew characters in use in our Lord's time were much more similar to the usual form under which we know them (<span class="accented">Quadrate schrift</span>) than to the form found on the Moabite Stone (Phoenician), where the <span class="accented">god</span> is no smaller than other letters (<span class="accented">vide</span> Euting's very complete table of forms of the Hebrew alphabet in Chwolsen, 'Corp. Inscript. Hebr.,' 1882; <span class="accented">vide</span> pp. 404-415 of the same work for Chwolson's much-controverted theory of the gradual development of the <span class="accented">Quadrat-sehrift</span>, roughly from the time of Ezra till the eighth or <span class="date">ninth century A.D.</span>, out of old Aramaic forms slightly removed from Phoenician; and for the early history of the Hebrew alphabet generally, see the introduction to Driver's 'Samuel.' <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> We may, perhaps, see in our Lord's reference to <span class="accented">yod</span> and a "tittle" an indication that even already scrupulous care was taken of the text. The objection to this, derived from the non-literal quotations in the New Testament is due to a misunderstanding of Jewish methods of quotation. <span class="cmt_word">Or one tittle</span>.

This double use of the Greek word forbids absolute certainty as to what our Lord was referring to, especially as the Hebrew word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5e6;</span>, literally, "thorn") of which <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is a translation has itself a double sense, viz.: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The end of a letter, especially the "thorn-like" small upward stroke of <span class="accented">yod.</span> So most interpreters since Origen (in Wetstein), who says that the Hebrew letters <span class="accented">eaph</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;</span>) and <span class="accented">beth</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;</span>) differ only by a short <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. They also quote the well-known Jewish examples (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> in Wetstein) of the effect of negligence in writing similar letters; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> if one writes <span class="accented">resh</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;</span>) for <span class="accented">daleth</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;</span>), "one" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>) becomes "another;" if <span class="accented">heth</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;</span>) for <span class="accented">he</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span>), "praise" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/150.htm">Psalm 150</a>.) becomes "profane." It must be noticed that the extremities of such Hebrew letters as we possess, which were actually written in our Lord's time on earth, are much more "thorn" "horn"-like than those of our printed texts.

Weber, 'Altsynag. Theol.,' &sect; 27, 2 <span class="accented">a</span>, and the article on Akiba in 'Dict. of Christian Biogr.'). If it be objected that our Lord could hardly refer to these marks of traditional explanation as of such permanence, the answer is that in so far as these expressed legitimate issues (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>, ver. 21) of the Mosaic Law, he could place them on the same level as that Law itself. <span class="cmt_word">Till all</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">till all things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all things in the Law - all the requirements of the Law, in contrast to the one "jot" or "tittle" just mentioned. <span class="cmt_word">Till all be fulfilled</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">be accomplished</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1ffd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). The clause is probably epexegetical of "till heaven and earth pass away." Nothing in the Law shall pass away till heaven and earth pass away, when, with a new heaven and earth, all the contents of the Law will be completely realized (cf. Nosgen) so that even then nothing in the Law shall pass away (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>). On the contrary, every part of it, moral or ceremonial (Weiss), shall then, by being fully understood and obeyed in its true meaning, enter on its full and complete existence (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:17-20 Let none suppose that Christ allows his people to trifle with any commands of God's holy law. No sinner partakes of Christ's justifying righteousness, till he repents of his evil deeds. The mercy revealed in the gospel leads the believer to still deeper self-abhorrence. The law is the Christian's rule of duty, and he delights therein. If a man, pretending to be Christ's disciple, encourages himself in any allowed disobedience to the holy law of God, or teaches others to do the same, whatever his station or reputation among men may be, he can be no true disciple. Christ's righteousness, imputed to us by faith alone, is needed by every one that enters the kingdom of grace or of glory; but the new creation of the heart to holiness, produces a thorough change in a man's temper and conduct.</body></html>
