Taking it as it stands here, we note (1) the extension of the command to love our neighbour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-18.htm" title="You shall not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 19:18</a>), so that it includes even those whom natural impulse prompts us to hate; (2) the stress laid on prayer as the highest utterance of that love. In such cases, circumstances may preclude acts which would be rejected, and words that would be met with scorn, but the prayer that they too may be delivered from the evil which has been their curse is always in our <span class= "ital">power,</span> and in so praying we are drawing near to the mind of God, and asking that our wills may be as His.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-27.htm">Luke 6:27, 28</a>. <span class="cmt_word">But</span> <span class="cmt_word">I say unto you, Love your enemies.</span> Of all kinds, whether personal or opponents of you as Christians. <span class="cmt_word">Bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you</span>. Rightly omitted by the Revised Version as interpolated from Luke, (For the thought, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-12.htm">1 Corinthians 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-14.htm">Romans 12:14</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">And pray.</span> In fullest contrast to the continual ill-wishing of the enemy. "They who can pray for their enemies can accomplish the rest" (Weiss, 'Life,' 2:154). Thus to pray is to come very near to the spirit of Christ (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-60.htm">Acts 7:60</a>). As a modern example: "Some persons had never had a particular place in my prayers, but for the injuries they have done to me" (Burkitt, ' Diary,' in Ford, on ver. 5). <span class="cmt_word">For them that</span> <span class="cmt_word">despitefully use you, and persecute you.</span> The words, "that despitefully use you and," are to be omitted, with the Revised Version, as in effect interpolated from Luke. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:43-48 The Jewish teachers by neighbour understood only those who were of their own country, nation, and religion, whom they were pleased to look upon as their friends. The Lord Jesus teaches that we must do all the real kindness we can to all, especially to their souls. We must pray for them. While many will render good for good, we must render good for evil; and this will speak a nobler principle than most men act by. Others salute their brethren, and embrace those of their own party, and way, and opinion, but we must not so confine our respect. It is the duty of Christians to desire, and aim at, and press towards perfection in grace and holiness. And therein we must study to conform ourselves to the example of our heavenly Father, 1Pe 1:15,16. Surely more is to be expected from the followers of Christ than from others; surely more will be found in them than in others. Let us beg of God to enable us to prove ourselves his children.</body></html>
