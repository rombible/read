It is doubtful, however, whether it ever had this factitive sense in English outside the Authorised version, and the common use of the word gives so different a meaning that it cannot be regarded as a happy rendering. The difficulty of finding an equivalent is shown by the variations in the successive English versions: "offend," in Tyndal's; "hinder thee," in Cranmer's; "cause thee to offend," in the Geneva; "scandalise," in the Rhemish; "offend," again in the Authorised version. Of these the Geneva is, beyond doubt, the best.<p><span class= "bld">Pluck it out.</span>--The bold severity of the phrase excludes a literal interpretation. The seat of the evil lies in the will, not in the organ of sense or action, and the removal of the instrument might leave the inward taint unpurified. What is meant is, that any sense, when it ministers to sin is an evil and not a good, the loss of which would be the truest gain. Translated into modern language, we are warned that taste, culture, aesthetic refinement may but make our guilt and our punishment more tremendous. It were better to be without them than<p>"Propter vitam vivendi perdere causas."<p>[" And for life's sake to lose life's noblest ends."]<p><span class= "bld">It is profitable.</span>--The element of prudential self-love, of a calculation of profit and loss, is not excluded from Christian motives. As addressed to a nation immersed in the pursuit of gain, it conveys the stern, yet pertinent, warning--"If you must think of profit, make your calculations wisely."<p><span class= "bld">Hell.</span>--Gehenna, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-22.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.">Matthew 5:22</a>. The language is still symbolical. The horrid picture of a human body thrown into the foul, offal-fed flame of the Valley of Hinnom is again a parable of something more terrible than itself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29, 30.</span> - Also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-8.htm">Matthew 18:8, 9</a> (parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-43.htm">Mark 9:43-47</a>); the chief differences being <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that they are there adduced with reference to "offences" generally; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the foot is mentioned, as well as the eye and the hand. It seems not improbable that this saying was spoken twice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The reason why our Lord did not mention the foot here may be either that that member is less immediately connected with sins of the flesh than the other two (cf. Wetstein, <span class="accented">in loc</span>., "Averte oculum a vultu illecebroso: arce manum ab impudicis contrectationibus"), or, as seems more probable, that the eye and the hand represent the two sets of faculties receptive and active, and together express man's whole nature. The insertion of the foot in ch. 18:8, 9, only makes the illustration more definite. "The remark in ver. 29f treats of what is to be done by the subjects of the kingdom when, in spite of themselves, evil desires are aroused" (Weiss, 'Life,' 2:149). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Right</span>. Not in ch. 18, and parallel passage. Inserted to enhance the preciousness of the members spoken of (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-17.htm">Zechariah 11:17</a>; cf. ver. 39). <span class="cmt_word">Offend</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee;</span> Authorized Version, <span class="accented">do cause thee to offend</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">cause thee to stumble </span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>). Perhaps the verb originally referred to the stick of a trap (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, a Hellenistic word, apparently equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) striking the person's foot, and so catching him in the trap; but when found in literature (almost solely in the New Testament) it has apparently lost all connotation of the trap, and only means causing a person to stumble (for an analysis of its use in the New Testament, <span class="accented">vide</span> especially Cremer, <span class="accented">s.v.</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Pluck it out, and cast it from</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee.</span> The second clause shows the purely figurative character of the sentence. Our Lord commands <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the removal of the means of "<span class="accented">offence"</span> out of the place of affection that it has long held; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the putting it away so thoroughly, both by the manner of the act and the distance placed between the "offence" and the person, that restoration is almost impossible. In both verbs the aorist brings out the decisiveness of the action. <span class="cmt_word">For it is profitable for</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee that one of thy members should perish.</span> It is better to lose one faculty, one sphere of usefulness, one part of those things which normally make a person complete, than that the person himself should be lost. Notice the sixfold personal pronoun in this one verse; "Our Lord grounds his precept of the most rigid and decisive <span class="accented">self-denial</span> on the considerations of the <span class="accented">truest self interest"</span> (Alford). <span class="cmt_word">Should be cast</span>. For to One thy whole person will become as abhorrent as the offending member ought in fact now to be to thee (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:27-32 Victory over the desires of the heart, must be attended with painful exertions. But it must be done. Every thing is bestowed to save us from our sins, not in them. All our senses and powers must be kept from those things which lead to transgression. Those who lead others into temptation to sin, by dress or in other ways, or leave them in it, or expose them to it, make themselves guilty of their sin, and will be accountable for it. If painful operations are submitted to, that our lives may be saved, what ought our minds to shrink from, when the salvation of our souls is concerned? There is tender mercy under all the Divine requirements, and the grace and consolations of the Spirit will enable us to attend to them.</body></html>
