The first impression made by the words is indeed so strongly in their favour that the scruples of such men ought to be dealt with (as English legislation has at last dealt with them) with great tenderness. Their conclusion is, however, it is believed, mistaken: (1) Because, were it true, then in this instance our Lord would be directly repealing part of the moral law given by Moses, instead of completing and expanding it, as in the case of the Sixth and Seventh Commandments. He would be destroying, not fulfilling. (2) Because our Lord himself answered, when He had before been silent, to a solemn formal adjuration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/26-63.htm" title="But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said to him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you be the Christ, the Son of God.">Matthew 26:63-64</a>), and St. Paul repeatedly uses such forms of attestation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-9.htm" title="For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;">Romans 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-31.htm" title="I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our LORD, I die daily.">1Corinthians 15:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-23.htm" title="Moreover I call God for a record on my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet to Corinth.">2Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-20.htm" title="Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.">Galatians 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-8.htm" title="For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.">Philippians 1:8</a>). (3) Because the context shows that the sin which our Lord condemned was the light use of oaths in common speech, and with no real thought as to their meaning. Such oaths practically involved irreverence, and were therefore inconsistent with the fear of God. The real purpose of an oath is to intensify that fear by bringing the thought of God's presence home to men at the very time they take them, and they are therefore rightly used when they attain that end. Practically, it must be admitted that the needless multiplication of oaths, both evidential and promissory, on trivial occasions, has tended, and still tends, to weaken awe and impair men's reverence for truth, and we may rejoice when their number is diminished. In an ideal Christian society no oaths would be needed, for every word would be spoken as by those who knew that the Eternal Judge was hearing them.<p>(34-35) <span class= "bld">Neither by heaven; . . . nor by the earth; . . . neither by Jerusalem.</span>--Other formulae of oaths meet us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/23-16.htm" title="Woe to you, you blind guides, which say, Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!">Matthew 23:16-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-12.htm" title="But above all things, my brothers, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yes be yes; and your no, no; lest you fall into condemnation.">James 5:12</a>. It is not easy at first to understand the thought that underlies such modes of speech. When men swear by God, or the name of Jehovah, there is an implied appeal to the Supreme Ruler. We invoke Him (as in the English form, "So help me God") to assist and bless us according to the measure of our truthfulness, or to punish us if we speak falsely. But to swear by a <span class= "ital">thing</span> that has no power or life seems almost unintelligible, unless the thing invoked be regarded as endowed in idea with a mysterious holiness and a power to bless and curse. Once in use, it was natural that men under a system like that of Israel, or, we may add, of Christendom, should employ them as convenient symbols intensifying affirmation, and yet not involving the speaker in the guilt of perjury or in the profane utterance of the divine name. Our Lord deals with all such formulae in the same way. If they have any force at all, it is because they imply a reference to the Eternal. Heaven is His throne, and earth is His footstool (the words are a citation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that you build to me? and where is the place of my rest?">Isaiah 66:1</a>), and Jerusalem is the city of the great King. To use them lightly is, therefore, to profane the holy name which they imply. Men do not guard themselves either against irreverence or perjury by such expedients.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Swear not at all</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-12.htm">James 5:12</a>). Yet, as St. Augustine points out, St. Paul took oaths in his writings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-23.htm">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-31.htm">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>); and our Lord himself did not refuse to answer when put upon his oath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63, 64</a>). He, that is to say, and St. Paul after him, accepted the fact that there are times when a solemn oath must be taken. How, then, can we explain this absolute prohibition here? In that our Lord is not here thinking at all of formal and solemn oaths, but of oaths as the outcome of impatience and exaggeration. The thoughtlessness of fervent asseveration is often betrayed into an oath. Such an oath, or even any asseveration that passes in spirit beyond "yea, yea," "nay, nay," has its origin <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>; cf. Chaucer, "Sweryng sodeynly without avysement is eek a gret synne" ('Parson's Tale,' &sect; 'De Ira'). Martensen, however ('Ethics, Individual,' &sect; 100), takes the prohibition of oaths as formally unconditional and total, in accordance with the highest ideal of what man will hereafter be and require, and he sees the limitation, which he allows is to be given to these words, in the present conditions of human society. We have an ideal duty towards God, but we have also a practical duty to those among whom we live, and the present state of human affairs permits and necessitates oaths. Hence it was that even Christ submitted to them. <span class="cmt_word">Neither by heaven</span>, etc. Our Lord further defines what he means by an oath. It does not mean only an expression in which God's Name is mentioned, but any expression appealing to any object at all, whether this be supraterrestrial, terrestrial, national, or personal. Although God's Name is often omitted in such cases, from a feeling of reverence, its omission does not prevent the asseveration being an oath. <span class="accented">Heaven</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">the heaven</span>; for the thought is clearly not the immaterial transcendental heaven, the abode of bliss, but the physical heaven (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a>, Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">Heaven... footstool</span>. Adapted from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>, where it forms part of the glorious declaration that no material temple can contain God, that "the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands" as St. Stephen paraphrases it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-48.htm">Acts 7:48</a>). The great King is seated enthroned in the heaven, with his feet touching the earth. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:33-37 There is no reason to consider that solemn oaths in a court of justice, or on other proper occasions, are wrong, provided they are taken with due reverence. But all oaths taken without necessity, or in common conversation, must be sinful, as well as all those expressions which are appeals to God, though persons think thereby to evade the guilt of swearing. The worse men are, the less they are bound by oaths; the better they are, the less there is need for them. Our Lord does not enjoin the precise terms wherein we are to affirm or deny, but such a constant regard to truth as would render oaths unnecessary.</body></html>
