It is not simply, Let your light so shine that men may glorify; but, "Thus, like the lamp on its stand, let your light shine. . . ."

We have at least a partial fulfilment of the command in the impression made on the heathen world by the new life of the Church when they confessed, in spite of all prejudices, "See how these Christians love one another."<p><span class= "bld">Your Father which is in heaven.</span>--The name was in common use among devout Jews, but its first occurrence in our Lord's teaching deserves to be noted. The thought of God as a Father was that which was to inspire men not only when engaged in prayer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-9.htm" title="After this manner therefore pray you: Our Father which are in heaven, Hallowed be your name.">Matthew 6:9</a>), but in the activity of obedience. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-9.htm" title="After this manner therefore pray you: Our Father which are in heaven, Hallowed be your name.">Matthew 6:9</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - Matthew only. <span class="cmt_word">Let your light so shine</span>; <span class="accented">even so let your light shine</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x1f70;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. The Revised Version (cf. Rheims) does away with the misinterpretation suggested by the Authorized Version, "so that," for <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> refers solely to the method of shining spoken of in ver. 15, "like a burning lamp upon its stand" (Meyer). Our Lord has here no thought of effort in shining, such as may improve the brightness of the light given, or of illuminating others, but of not concealing what light the disciples have. (For a similar <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>.) Yet remember, "A lamp for one is a lamp for a hundred" (Talm. Bab., 'Sabb.,' 122<span class="accented">a</span>) and "Adam was the lamp of the world" (Talm. Jeremiah, 'Sabb.,' 2:4 - a play on <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-27.htm">Proverbs 20:27</a>). <span class="accented">Your light. Either</span> genitive of apposition, the light which you are (Achelis), cf. ver. 14; or genitive of possession, the light of which you are the trusted possessors (Meyer, Weiss). The latter is preferable, as the disciples have, in ver. 15, been compared to the lamp, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the light-bearer. <span class="cmt_word">Before men</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). More than <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "in presence of," for the position of the lamp "in front of" the people is what our Lord is here emphasizing (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-37.htm">John 12:37</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That they may</span> <span class="cmt_word">see your good works</span> (<span class="greek_word">u(mw = n</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>)<span class="accented">. Your.</span> Three times in this verse. Our Lord lays stress on personal possession of light, personal action, personal relationship and origin. <span class="accented">Good works</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of your lives generally (Weiss-Meyer), not ministerially (Mever). "<span class="accented">Noble</span> <span class="accented">works</span>, works which by their generous and attractive character win the natural admiration of men" (Bishop Westcott, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And glorify</span>. This is actually done in ch. 9:8; 15:31. St. Peter's language (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>) is probably due to a reminiscence of our Lord's words. <span class="cmt_word">Your Father which is in heaven</span>. The Fatherhood of God is here predicated in a special sense of the disciples, in the same way as the Fatherhood of God is, in the Old Testament, always connected with his covenant relation to his people as a nation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-4.htm">Jeremiah 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>). Our <span class="accented">Lord</span> here is not thinking of the original relation of God to being and especially to humanity, in virtue of man's creation in the Divine image (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>), but of the relation into which the disciples have entered through the revelation of God in Christ; cf. further Bishop Westcott, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21</a> (Add. Note) and on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-2.htm">1 John 1:2</a> (Add. Note); also Weiss, 'Life,' 2:348. The phrase, which occurs here for the first time in St. Matthew (but cf. ver. 9, note), henceforth occurs frequently, becoming of great importance for this Gospel (cf. vers. 45, 48; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1, 9</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:13-16 Ye are the salt of the earth. Mankind, lying in ignorance and wickedness, were as a vast heap, ready to putrify; but Christ sent forth his disciples, by their lives and doctrines to season it with knowledge and grace. If they are not such as they should be, they are as salt that has lost its savour. If a man can take up the profession of Christ, and yet remain graceless, no other doctrine, no other means, can make him profitable. Our light must shine, by doing such good works as men may see. What is between God and our souls, must be kept to ourselves; but that which is of itself open to the sight of men, we must study to make suitable to our profession, and praiseworthy. We must aim at the glory of God.</body></html>
