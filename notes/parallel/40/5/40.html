Not in regard to acts of violence only, but also in dealing with the petty litigation that disturbs so many men's peace, it is better to yield than to insist on rights. St. Paul gives the same counsel to the believers at Corinth: "Why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-7.htm" title="Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because you go to law one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?">1Corinthians 6:7</a>). Here also, of course, the precept, absolutely binding, as far as self-interest is concerned, may be traversed by higher considerations.<p><span class= "bld">Coat.</span>--The close-fitting tunic worn next the body.<p><span class= "bld">Cloke.</span>--The outer flowing mantle, the more costly garment of the two. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-23.htm" title="Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.">John 19:23</a>, and the combination of the two words, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-39.htm" title="Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.">Acts 9:39</a>, "coats and garments.") The meaning of the illustration is obvious. It is wise rather to surrender more than is demanded, than to disturb the calm of our own spirit by wrangling and debate.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - The parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-29.htm">Luke 6:29</a>b, gives the taking of the garments in the converse order. <span class="cmt_word">And if any man will sue thee</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">and if any man would go to law with thee.</span> Notice that "will," "would" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>), implies that the trial has not yet even begun. Do this even <span class="accented">before</span> it. <span class="cmt_word">And take away</span> <span class="cmt_word">thy coat, let him have thy cloke also</span>. <span class="accented">Coat</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>), equivalent to tunic, "shirt-like under-garment" (Meyer). <span class="accented">Cloke</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), equivalent to over-cloak, "mantle-like over-garment, toga, which also served for a covering by night, and might not therefore be retained as a pledge over night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26</a>)' (Meyer). This is put second, as being the more valuable. In Luke, where there is no mention of the law-court, the thought seems to be merely of the violent removal of the garments, taking them as they came. <span class="accented">Let him have</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>). More positive than Luke's "withhold not" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:38-42 The plain instruction is, Suffer any injury that can be borne, for the sake of peace, committing your concerns to the Lord's keeping. And the sum of all is, that Christians must avoid disputing and striving. If any say, Flesh and blood cannot pass by such an affront, let them remember, that flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God; and those who act upon right principles will have most peace and comfort.</body></html>
