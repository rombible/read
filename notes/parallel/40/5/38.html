As originally given, it was a check on the "wild justice" of revenge. It said, where the equilibrium of right had been disturbed by outrage, that the work of the judge was not to do more than restore the equilibrium, unless, as in the case of theft, some further penalty was necessary for the prevention of crime. It was, in its essence, a limit in both directions. Not less than the "eye for an eye," for that might lead to connivance in guilt; not more, for that would open a fresh score of wrong. The scribes in their popular casuistry made the rule one not of judicial action only, but of private retaliation; and it was thus made the sanction of the vindictive temper that forgives nothing.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 38-48.</span> - The two remaining examples of the current teaching of the Law are very closely connected together, and, in fact, our Lord's corrections of them are intermingled in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-27.htm">Luke 6:27-36</a>. Yet the subjects are really distinct. In the first (vers. 38-42) our Lord speaks of the reception of injuries, in the second (vers. 43-48) of the treatment of those who do them. Godet's remarks (in his summary of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-27.htm">Luke 6:27-45</a>) on the use made by St. Luke of these examples are especially instructive. "These last two antitheses, which terminate in Matthew in the lofty thought (ver. 48) of man being elevated by love to the perfection of God, furnish Luke with the leading idea of the discourse as he presents it, namely, charity as the law of the new life." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 38-42.</span> - <span class="accented">The reception of injuries. </span> The Law inculcated that the injured should obtain from those who did the wrong exact compensation (on this being properly a command, not merely a permission, <span class="accented">vide</span> Mozley, 'Ruling Ideas,' etc., pp. 182, sqq.). Our Lord inculcates giving up of all in-sistance upon one's rights as an injured person, and entire submission to injuries, even as far as proffering the opportunity for fresh wrongs. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth</span>. No short phrase could more accurately describe the spirit of the Mosaic legislation. Offences against individuals were to be punished by the injured individual receiving back, as it were, the exact compensation from him who had injured him. While this was originally observed literally, it was in Mishnic times (and probably in the time of our Lord) softened to payment of money (<span class="accented">vide</span> Lightfoot, 'Hor. Hebr.'). The phrase comes three times in the Pentateuch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-24.htm">Exodus 21:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-20.htm">Leviticus 24:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-21.htm">Deuteronomy 19:21</a>). Notice: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The LXX. has the accusative in each case, although only in the first does a verb precede. Probably the expression had already become proverbial in Greek even before the translation of the LXX. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Hebrew of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-21.htm">Deuteronomy 19:21</a> is slightly different from that of the other two passages, and as the preposition there used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;</span>) is not so necessarily rendered by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span>, that passage is perhaps the least likely of the three to have been in our Lord's mind now. It seems likely, however, that he was not thinking of any one of the three passages in particular. The words served him as a summary of the Law in this respect. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:38-42 The plain instruction is, Suffer any injury that can be borne, for the sake of peace, committing your concerns to the Lord's keeping. And the sum of all is, that Christians must avoid disputing and striving. If any say, Flesh and blood cannot pass by such an affront, let them remember, that flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God; and those who act upon right principles will have most peace and comfort.</body></html>
