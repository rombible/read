Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.">1Corinthians 5:13</a>, the human evil-doer. Of that mightier "evil one" we are emphatically told that it is our duty to resist him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-7.htm" title="Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.">James 4:7</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Shall smite.</span>--The word was used of blows with the hand or with a stick, and for such blows fines from a shekel upwards were imposed by Jewish courts.<p><span class= "bld">Turn to him the other also.</span>--We all quote and admire the words as painting an ideal meekness. But most men feel also that they cannot act on them literally; that to make the attempt, as has been done by some whom the world calls dreamers or fanatics, would throw society into confusion and make the meek the victims. The question meets us, therefore, Were they meant to be obeyed in the letter; and if not, what do they command? And the answer is found (l) in remembering that our Lord Himself, when smitten by the servant of the high priest, protested, though He did not resist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/18-22.htm" title="And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answer you the high priest so?">John 18:22-23</a>), and that St. Paul, under like outrage, was vehement in his rebuke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-3.htm" title="Then said Paul to him, God shall smite you, you white washed wall: for sit you to judge me after the law, and command me to be smitten contrary to the law?">Acts 23:3</a>); and (2) in the fact that the whole context shows that the Sermon on the Mount is not a code of laws, but the assertion of principles. And the principle in this matter is clearly and simply this, that the disciple of Christ, when he has suffered wrong, is to eliminate altogether from his motives the natural desire to retaliate or accuse. As far as he himself is concerned, he must be prepared, in language which, because it is above our common human strain, has stamped itself on the hearts and memories of men, to turn the left cheek when the right has been smitten. But the man who has been wronged has other duties which he cannot rightly ignore. The law of the Eternal has to be asserted, society to be protected, the offender to be reclaimed, and these may well justify--though personal animosity does not--protest, prosecution, punishment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee,</span> etc. The first clause comes here only; the second is found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-29.htm">Luke 6:29</a> (for the principle, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-7.htm">1 Corinthians 6:7</a>). We may notice that, while our Lord most perfectly observed the spirit of this command, he did not slavishly follow the letter of it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-22.htm">John 18:22, 23</a>). Nor did St. Paul (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-35.htm">Acts 16:35</a><span class="accented">ff</span>; Acts 22:25; 23:3; 25:9,10). We must remember that, while he clothes his teaching with the form of concrete examples, these are only parabolic representations of principles eternal in themselves, but in practice to be modified according to each separate occasion. "This offering of the other cheek <span class="accented">may</span> be done outwardly; but only inwardly can it be always right" (Trench, 'Sermon on the Mount'). We must further remember the distinction brought out here by Luther between what the Christian has to do as a Christian, and what he has to do as, perhaps an official, member of the state. The Lord leaves to the state its own jurisdiction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-21.htm">Matthew 22:21</a>: <span class="accented">vide</span> Meyer). <span class="accented">That ye resist not</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">resist not</span>, thus avoiding all possibility of the English reader taking the words as a statement of fact. <span class="accented">Evil</span>. So the Revised Version margin; but Revised Version, <span class="accented">him that is evil</span> (cf. ver. 37; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>, note). The masculine here, in the sense of the wicked man who does the wrong, is clearly preferable; Wickliffe, "a yuel man." (For a very careful defence of Chrysostom's opinion that even here <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;</span> refers to the devil and not to man. see Chase, 'The Lord's Prayer in the Early Church'). <span class="accented">Shall smite</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">smiteth</span>, The right reading gives the more vivid present. <span class="greek">&#x1fec;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> comes in the New Testament here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-67.htm">Matthew 26:67</a> only. It is properly used of a stroke with a rod. (For "smiting on the cheeks," cf. the curious rendering of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-4.htm">Hosea 11:4</a> in the LXX; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Thee</span> <span class="cmt_word">on thy right</span>. Matthew only. Although it is more natural that the left cheek would be hit first (Meyer), the right is named, since it is in common parle, nee held to be the worthier (cf. ver. 29). <span class="cmt_word">Cheek</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, though <span class="accented">properly jaw</span>, is here equivalent to" cheek," as certainly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-10.htm">Song of Solomon 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/5-13.htm">Song of Solomon 5:13</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Turn</span>. The action seen; Luke's "offer" regards the mental condition necessary for the action. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:38-42 The plain instruction is, Suffer any injury that can be borne, for the sake of peace, committing your concerns to the Lord's keeping. And the sum of all is, that Christians must avoid disputing and striving. If any say, Flesh and blood cannot pass by such an affront, let them remember, that flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God; and those who act upon right principles will have most peace and comfort.</body></html>
