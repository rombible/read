The attempt at that likeness to the Godhead was the cause of man's fall, and leads evermore to a like issue; but we cannot err in striving to be like Him in His love. (Comp. St. Paul's "followers [or, more literally, <span class= "ital">imitators"</span>] of God" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-1.htm" title="Be you therefore followers of God, as dear children;">Ephesians 5:1</a>.) And the love which we are to reproduce is not primarily that of which the children of the kingdom are the direct objects, showing itself in pardon, and adoption, and spiritual blessings, but the beneficence which is seen in Nature. Our Lord assumes that sunshine, and rain, and fruitful seasons are His Father's gifts, and proofs (whatever may be urged to the contrary) of His loving purpose. Here, again, the teaching of the higher Stoics presents an almost verbal parallel: "If thou wouldst imitate the gods, do good even to the unthankful, for the sun rises even on the wicked, and the seas are open to pirates" (Seneca, <span class= "ital">De Benefic.</span> iv. 2, 6).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-35.htm">Luke 6:35</a>, which is more full, but hardly so original in form. <span class="cmt_word">That ye may be the children</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>); sons (Revised Version); cf. ver. 9, note. The meaning of the clause is not certain. It may be: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Love to enemies is the means whereby you may become possessed of the full privileges involved in the nature of sons. These privileges are more than the mere participation in Messianic glory (Meyer), and are rather all the blessings present and future which belong to sonship. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Love, in order that on each occasion you may become in fact (<span class="accented">almost</span> our "show yourselves") sons of your Father, sons corresponding in ethical conduct to your position already received. <span class="cmt_word">Your Father</span>. Not "the Father" (cf. ver. 16, note). <span class="cmt_word">Which is in heaven</span>: for <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> The privileges generally, or the resemblance on each occasion, can only be obtained by behaviour similar to his, namely, kind treatment of those who injure you; for this is what he himself shows. <span class="cmt_word">He maketh his sun to rise</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). If we may lay stress on the Greek, our Lord expresses the popular notion of the sun ascending. It must, however, be remembered that the word he himself probably used was <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5e8;&#x5d7;</span> in hiph. (, Peshito), which contains no thought of motion, but rather of appearance. <span class="cmt_word">Sun... rain</span>. The two great sources of maintenance. <span class="cmt_word">On the evil and on the good... on the just and on the unjust.</span> The first pair connotes, as it seems, the extreme of evil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>, note) and good, in each case manifesting itself according to its opportunities; the second, the life and character as tried by the standard, especially the human standard, of just dealing. Notice how, by chiasm, the emphasis is laid on the ungodly alike at the beginning and at the end. Our Lord here brings out God's active love as seen in nature, nourishing and maintaining men, irrespective of the qualities of individuals and of their treatment of him and his laws. The thought is found elsewhere, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in Seneca (<span class="accented">vide</span> Meyer), "Si deos imitaris, da et ingratis benelicia; ham et sceleratis sol oritur, et piratis patent maria" (cf. Bishop Lightfoot, on 'Philippians' ["St. Paul and Seneca," p. 281], for a collection of parallels to the sermon on the mount). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:43-48 The Jewish teachers by neighbour understood only those who were of their own country, nation, and religion, whom they were pleased to look upon as their friends. The Lord Jesus teaches that we must do all the real kindness we can to all, especially to their souls. We must pray for them. While many will render good for good, we must render good for evil; and this will speak a nobler principle than most men act by. Others salute their brethren, and embrace those of their own party, and way, and opinion, but we must not so confine our respect. It is the duty of Christians to desire, and aim at, and press towards perfection in grace and holiness. And therein we must study to conform ourselves to the example of our heavenly Father, 1Pe 1:15,16. Surely more is to be expected from the followers of Christ than from others; surely more will be found in them than in others. Let us beg of God to enable us to prove ourselves his children.</body></html>
