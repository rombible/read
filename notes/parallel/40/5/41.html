The use of the illustration here would seem to imply the adoption of the same system by the Roman Government under the empire. Roman soldiers and their horses were billeted on Jewish householders. Others were impressed for service of longer or shorter duration.<p><span class= "bld">A mile.</span>--The influence of Rome is shown by the use of the Latin word (slightly altered) for the <span class= "ital">mille passuum,</span> the thousand paces which made up a Roman mile--about 142 yards short of an English statute mile. It is interesting to note a like illustration of the temper that yields to compulsion of this kind, rather than struggle or resist, in the teaching of the Stoic Epictetus--"Should there be a forced service, and a soldier should lay hold on thee, let him work his will<span class= "ital">;</span> do not resist or murmur" (<span class= "ital">Diss.</span> iv., i. 79).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - Matthew only. <span class="cmt_word">Shall compel thee to go</span>; Revised Version margin, "Gr. impress" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). From the Persian. Hatch ('Essays,' p. 37) shows that while the classical usage strictly refers to the Persian system or' mounted couriers (described in Herod., 8:98; Xen., 'Cyr.,' 8:6. 17), the post-classical usage refers to the later development of a system, not of postal service, but of the forced transport of military baggage. It thus indicates, not merely forced attendance, but forced carrying. Hence it is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-32.htm">Matthew 27:32</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-21.htm">Mark 15:21</a> of Simon the Cyrenian, "who was pressed by the Roman soldiers who were escorting our Lord not merely to accompany them but also to carry a load." Thus here also the thought is doubtless that of being compelled to carry baggage. There may also be a reference, as Hatch suggests, to the oppressive conduct of the Roman soldiers (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-14.htm">Luke 3:14</a>). (For the spirit of our Lord's saying, <span class="accented">vide</span> also 'Aboth,' 3:18 (Taylor), where the probable translation is, "Rabbi Ishmael said, Be pliant of disposition and <span class="accented">yielding to impressment."</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>A mile</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">one mile</span>; but see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-19.htm">Matthew 8:19</a>, note. A Roman mile of a thousand paces. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:38-42 The plain instruction is, Suffer any injury that can be borne, for the sake of peace, committing your concerns to the Lord's keeping. And the sum of all is, that Christians must avoid disputing and striving. If any say, Flesh and blood cannot pass by such an affront, let them remember, that flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God; and those who act upon right principles will have most peace and comfort.</body></html>
