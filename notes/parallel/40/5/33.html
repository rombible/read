Here, again, the reference is to the letter of the Law as taught by the Rabbis, who did not go beyond it to its wider spirit. To them the Third Commandment was simply a prohibition of perjury, as the Sixth was of murder, or the Seventh of adultery. They did not see that the holy name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-12.htm" title="And you shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shall you profane the name of your God: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 19:12</a>) might be profaned in other ways, even when it was not uttered; and they expressly or tacitly allowed (See Philo, <span class= "ital">De Special. Legg.</span>) many forms of oath in which it was not named, as with the view of guarding it from desecration. Lastly, out of the many forms thus sanctioned (as here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/23-16.htm" title="Woe to you, you blind guides, which say, Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!">Matthew 23:16-22</a>) they selected some as binding, and others as not binding, and thus by a casuistry at once subtle, irrational, and dishonest, tampered with men's sense of truthfulness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 33-37.</span> - <span class="accented">Oaths.</span> Matthew only; but cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-16.htm">Matthew 23:16-22</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By them of old time</span> (ver. 21, note). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not forswear thyself</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>). These two words are the substance of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-12.htm">Leviticus 19:12</a>, which itself (cf. Rashi, <span class="accented">in lee.</span>) includes a reference to the third commandment. To them our Lord joins <span class="cmt_word">but shalt perform</span>, etc., which is the substance of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-23.htm">Deuteronomy 23:23</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>). (On our Lord's utterance representing the current form of teaching about oaths, cf. ver. 21, note.) This current teaching was the logical deduction from the statements of the Law, and yet the Law had a higher aim. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:33-37 There is no reason to consider that solemn oaths in a court of justice, or on other proper occasions, are wrong, provided they are taken with due reverence. But all oaths taken without necessity, or in common conversation, must be sinful, as well as all those expressions which are appeals to God, though persons think thereby to evade the guilt of swearing. The worse men are, the less they are bound by oaths; the better they are, the less there is need for them. Our Lord does not enjoin the precise terms wherein we are to affirm or deny, but such a constant regard to truth as would render oaths unnecessary.</body></html>
