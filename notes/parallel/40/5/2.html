The multitudes, however, were standing by, and were amazed at the unique character of his teaching (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28, 29</a>; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-20.htm">Luke 6:20</a> with Luke 7:1). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1,2 None will find happiness in this world or the next, who do not seek it from Christ by the rule of his word.
