From moichos; to commit adultery.</span><br /><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">Saving for the cause of fornication.</span>--The most generic term seems intentionally used to include ante-nuptial as well as post-nuptial sin, possibly, indeed, with reference to the former only, seeing that the strict letter of the Law of Moses made death the punishment of the latter, and so excluded the possibility of the adultery of a second marriage. The words <span class= "ital">causeth her to commit adultery</span> imply that the "putting away" was legally a divorce <span class= "ital">a vinculo,</span> leaving the wife, and <span class= "ital">a fortiori</span> the husband, at liberty to marry again; for otherwise she could not have incurred the guilt of adultery by a second marriage: but it asserts that in such a case, when divorce was obtained on any other ground than the specific sin which violated the essence of the marriage contract, man's law (even that of Moses) was at variance with the true eternal law of God.<p><span class= "bld">Whosoever shall marry her that is divorced.</span>--The Greek is less definite, and may be rendered either "a woman who has been put away," or better, "her when she has been put away." Those who take the former construction, infer from it the absolute unlawfulness of marriage with a divorced woman under any circumstances whatever; some holding that the husband is under the same restrictions, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>that the <span class= "ital">vinculum matrimonii</span> is absolutely indissoluble; while others teach that in the excepted case, both the husband and the wife gain the right to contract a second marriage. The Romish Church, in theory, takes the former view, the Greek and most Reformed Churches the latter; while some codes, like those of some countries in modern Europe, go back to the looser interpretation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm" title="When a man has taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes, because he has found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>, and allow the divorce <span class= "ital">a vinculo</span> for many lesser causes than incontinence. Of these contending views, that which is intermediate between the two extremes seems to be most in harmony with the true meaning of our Lord's words. The words "put away" would necessarily convey to His Jewish hearers the idea of an entire dissolution of the marriage union, leaving both parties free to contract a fresh marriage; and if it were not so, then the case in which He specially permits that dissolution would stand on the same level as the others. The injured husband would still be bound to the wife who had broken the vow which was of the essence of the marriage-contract. But if he was free to marry again, then the guilt of adultery could not possibly attach to her subsequent marriage with another. The context, therefore, requires us to restrict that guilt to the case of a wife divorced for other reasons, such as Jewish casuistry looked on as adequate. This, then, seems the true law of divorce for the Church of Christ as such to recognise. The question as to how far national legislation may permit divorce for other causes, such as cruelty or desertion, seems to stand on a different footing, and must be discussed on different grounds. In proportion as the "hardness of heart" which made the wider license the least of two evils prevails now, it may be not only expedient, but right and necessary, though it implies a standard of morals lower than the law of Christ, to meet it, as it was met of old, by a like reluctant permission.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - (For full notes, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-9.htm">Matthew 19:9</a>.) Parallel passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-12.htm">Mark 10:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-18.htm">Luke 16:18</a>; apparently the context of Mark represents <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-1.htm">Matthew 19:1-8</a>, and the context of Luke rather represents <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>. Notice here: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Matthew alone, in both places, gives the exception of fornication. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> St. Paul refers in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-10.htm">1 Corinthians 7:10, 11</a> to this saying of our Lord's. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The laxity in this matter of the Hillel school of the Pharisees is well known. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Their theory, indeed, sounds good, viz. that there should be perfect unity in the marriage state; but starting from this premiss they affirmed that if in any single respect the unity was not attained, divorce might follow. For examples, see Lightfoot ('Hor. Hebr.'). Our Lord upholds the school of Shammai. It is said that shameful laxity in divorce still exists among Oriental Jews. <span class="cmt_word">Fornication</span>. The reference is to sin after marriage. Contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-20.htm">Deuteronomy 22:20, 21</a>, where the husband's action is not thought of as <span class="accented">divorce.</span> The more general word (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is used, because it lays more stress on the physical character of the sin than <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> would have laid. <span class="cmt_word">Causeth her to commit adultery</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">maketh her an adulteress</span>, since the right reading, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, connotes being sinned against rather than sinning (Received Text, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). (For the thought, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-3.htm">Romans 7:3</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">And whosoever shall marry</span>, etc. Bracketed by Westcott and Hort, as omitted by certain 'Western' authorities (especially D and Old Latin manuscripts). (On the importance of the 'Western' group in cases of omission, <span class="accented">vide</span> Westcott and Hort, 2. &sect;&sect; 240-242; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-34.htm">Matthew 9:34</a>, note.) The clause closely resembles <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-18.htm">Luke 16:18</a>b. <span class="cmt_word">Her that is divorced</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> under these wrong conditions, as Revised Version, <span class="accented">her when put away.</span> even though <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> is not expressed. This interpretation, notwithstanding Weiss's stigma of it as "ganz willkurlich," is surely only a plain deduction from the preceding clause. The fact that no such limitation is to be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-18.htm">Luke 16:18</a> must not prejudice our judgment here. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:27-32 Victory over the desires of the heart, must be attended with painful exertions. But it must be done. Every thing is bestowed to save us from our sins, not in them. All our senses and powers must be kept from those things which lead to transgression. Those who lead others into temptation to sin, by dress or in other ways, or leave them in it, or expose them to it, make themselves guilty of their sin, and will be accountable for it. If painful operations are submitted to, that our lives may be saved, what ought our minds to shrink from, when the salvation of our souls is concerned? There is tender mercy under all the Divine requirements, and the grace and consolations of the Spirit will enable us to attend to them.</body></html>
