The frequent combination of the two words (thirteen times in the first three Gospels) implies that for the most part they were of the school of the Pharisees, just as the "chief priests" were, for the most part, of that of the Sadducees. Where "scribes and chief priests" are united, it is with a different import, as the two chief divisions of the Sanhedrim, or Great Council. The New Testament use of the word differs from the Old. There the scribe is simply the man who writes, the secretary or registrar of the king's edicts and official documents (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-17.htm" title="And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;">2Samuel 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-25.htm" title="And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:">2Samuel 20:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-18.htm" title="And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.">2Kings 18:18</a>). After the return of Babylon, as in the case of Ezra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-6.htm" title="This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God on him.">Ezra 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-12.htm" title="Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a time.">Ezra 7:12</a>), it was used first of the transcribers and editors of the sacred books, and then, by a natural transition, of their interpreters; and this is the dominant sense of the word in the New Testament. As interpreters they were much occupied with the traditional comments of previous teachers, and these as descending more into particulars, and so affording a better basis for a casuistic system, had come to usurp the rightful place of the Law. As far as the three Gospels are concerned this is the first direct protest of our Lord against their teaching. St. John's record, however, shows that the conflict had begun already in Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-10.htm" title="The Jews therefore said to him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.">John 5:10</a>), and that the Sabbath question was prominent in it.<p><span class= "bld">Ye shall in no case enter . . . .</span>--The "kingdom of heaven" is here neither what we speak of as the visible Church--for there the evil and the good grow together till the harvest--nor yet the Church triumphant in the far future. It stands here rather for the ideal and invisible Church on earth--that which answers to its name, that to which belong the blessings and the promises. Into that Church none enter who are content with an outward conventional standard of righteousness. All who strive after a high standard, sooner or later, in spite of wanderings and mistakes, find their way into it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-34.htm" title="Then shall the King say to them on his right hand, Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:">Matthew 25:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-17.htm" title="If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.">John 7:17</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - Matthew only. The verse from "except" to the end is quoted verbally in Justin Martyr ('Trypho,' &sect; 105), as being in "the Memoirs." <span class="cmt_word">For I say</span>. So far from you my disciples (ver. 13) being right in despising any of the commands contained in the Law, they are all to be specially honoured by you; <span class="accented">for</span> <span class="cmt_word">your righteousness</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the righteousness you show in observing them; there is no thought here of the imputed righteousness of Christ) must far exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees; otherwise there is no entrance for you into the kingdom of heaven. But wherein lay the superiority of the righteousness which the disciples were to have? Did our Lord mean that his disciples were to painfully toil through the various enactments, ceremonial and other, of the Law as the scribes and Pharisees did, only with more serious and earnest purpose than they? That were in the case of many scribes and Pharisees hardly possible. For notwithstanding our Lord's occasional denunciations, many of them were men of the severest earnestness and the deepest conscientiousness, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Gamaliel and Saul of Tarsus. Our Lord must refer to the Law otherwise than as a system of enactments. His thought is similar to that of his words addressed to Nicodemus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a>), where he says that change of heart evidenced by public profession (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-10.htm">Romans 10:10</a>) is necessary for entrance into the kingdom of God (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-8.htm">Matthew 18:8</a>). So here; while the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, even when joined to earnestness of purpose, nevertheless consists in the observance of external rules, there is a higher principle in the Law, by observing which a higher righteousness can be attained. Christ points, that is to say, away from the Law as a system of external rules to the Law in its deeper meaning, affecting the relation of the heart to God (cf. further Weiss, 'Life,' 2:147). <span class="cmt_word">Shall exceed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">shall abound still more than.</span> The statement is not merely comparative, but implies an abundance (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:10</a>)even in the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees. The Jewish spirit reckons up good actions as producing in many cases even a superfluity of righteousness. But the righteousness which Christ's disciples must have needs to be still more abundant. <span class="accented">The righteousness</span>; omitted in the Greek (Westcott and Herr) by condensation. The scribes and Pharisees. The most learned (scribes) and the most zealous (Pharisees) in the Law (cf. Nosgen) are here placed in one class (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall in no case</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">in</span> no <span class="accented">wise.</span> "The emphatic negative <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span> is not elsewhere so rendered in the Authorized Version. The previous versions have in this place simply . ye shall not,' following the Vulgate,. <span class="accented">non intrabitis"</span> (<span class="accented">Humphry</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Enter into the kingdom of heaven</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-3.htm">Matthew 18:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21</a>). A much stronger statement than that of ver. 19, though some would identify the two. There Christ was comparing one disciple with another; here his disciples with non-disciples. "Such a relaxing for yourselves and others of the commandments will <span class="accented">set you low</span> in the true kingdom of obedience and holiness; but this of having a righteousness so utterly false and hollow as that of the scribes and Pharisees will not merely set you low, but will exclude you from that kingdom altogether (ver. 20); for while that marks an <span class="accented">impaired</span> spiritual vision, this marks a vision utterly darkened and destroyed" (Trench, ' Sermon on the Mount'). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:17-20 Let none suppose that Christ allows his people to trifle with any commands of God's holy law. No sinner partakes of Christ's justifying righteousness, till he repents of his evil deeds. The mercy revealed in the gospel leads the believer to still deeper self-abhorrence. The law is the Christian's rule of duty, and he delights therein. If a man, pretending to be Christ's disciple, encourages himself in any allowed disobedience to the holy law of God, or teaches others to do the same, whatever his station or reputation among men may be, he can be no true disciple. Christ's righteousness, imputed to us by faith alone, is needed by every one that enters the kingdom of grace or of glory; but the new creation of the heart to holiness, produces a thorough change in a man's temper and conduct.</body></html>
