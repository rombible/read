They who are pitiful towards men their brethren are <span class= "ital">ipso facto</span> the objects of the divine pity. The negative aspect of the same truth is presented in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-13.htm" title="For he shall have judgment without mercy, that has showed no mercy; and mercy rejoices against judgment.">James 2:13</a>. In this case, the promised blessing tends to perpetuate and strengthen the grace which is thus rewarded. No motive to mercy is so constraining as the feeling that we ourselves needed it and have found it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - Our Lord here turns more directly to the character of his followers in relation to men; and in the next three Beatitudes mentions particulars which might be suggested by the sixth, seventh, and ninth commandments. <span class="cmt_word">The merciful</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>). The mercy referred to here is not so much the almost negative quality which the word usually suggests to us (not dealing harshly, not inflicting punishment when due, sparing an animal or a fellow-man some unnecessary labour), as active kindness to the destitute and to any who are in trouble (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-27.htm">Matthew 9:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-22.htm">Matthew 15:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-15.htm">Matthew 17:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-19.htm">Mark 5:19</a>). As compared with <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-36.htm">Luke 6:36</a>), it seems to lay more stress on the feeling of pity showing itself in action and not only existing in thought. To this statement of our Lord's, that they who show mercy to those in need shall themselves be the objects of mercy (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> from God) in their time of need, many parallels have been adduced, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, by Wetstein. Rabbi Gamaliel (? the second, circa A.D. ), as reported by Rabbi Judah (circa A.D. ), says (Talm. Bab., 'Sabb.,' 151 <span class="accented">b</span>), on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-18.htm">Deuteronomy 13:18</a>, "Every one that showeth mercy to others, they show mercy to him from heaven, and every one that showeth not mercy to others, they show him not mercy from heaven;" cf. also ' Test. XII. Patr.:' Zab., &sect; 8, "In proportion as a man has compassion (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) on his neighbour, so has the Lord upon him;" and, probably with reference to this passage, Clem. Rom., &sect; 13, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fb6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. (For the converse, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-13.htm">James 2:13</a>.) Calvin remarks, "Hoc etiam paradoxon cum humano judicio pugnat. Mundus reputat beatos, qui malorum alienorum securi quieti suae consulunt: Christus autem hic beatos dicit, qui non modo ferendis propriis malis parati sunt, sed aliena etiam in se suscipiunt, ut miseris succurrant." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:3-12 Our Saviour here gives eight characters of blessed people, which represent to us the principal graces of a Christian. 1. The poor in spirit are happy. These bring their minds to their condition, when it is a low condition. They are humble and lowly in their own eyes. They see their want, bewail their guilt, and thirst after a Redeemer. The kingdom of grace is of such; the kingdom of glory is for them. 2. Those that mourn are happy. That godly sorrow which worketh true repentance, watchfulness, a humble mind, and continual dependence for acceptance on the mercy of God in Christ Jesus, with constant seeking the Holy Spirit, to cleanse away the remaining evil, seems here to be intended. Heaven is the joy of our Lord; a mountain of joy, to which our way is through a vale of tears. Such mourners shall be comforted by their God. 3. The meek are happy. The meek are those who quietly submit to God; who can bear insult; are silent, or return a soft answer; who, in their patience, keep possession of their own souls, when they can scarcely keep possession of anything else. These meek ones are happy, even in this world. Meekness promotes wealth, comfort, and safety, even in this world. 4. Those who hunger and thirst after righteousness are happy. Righteousness is here put for all spiritual blessings. These are purchased for us by the righteousness of Christ, confirmed by the faithfulness of God. Our desires of spiritual blessings must be earnest. Though all desires for grace are not grace, yet such a desire as this, is a desire of God's own raising, and he will not forsake the work of his own hands. 5. The merciful are happy. We must not only bear our own afflictions patiently, but we must do all we can to help those who are in misery. We must have compassion on the souls of others, and help them; pity those who are in sin, and seek to snatch them as brands out of the burning. 6. The pure in heart are happy; for they shall see God. Here holiness and happiness are fully described and put together. The heart must be purified by faith, and kept for God. Create in me such a clean heart, O God. None but the pure are capable of seeing God, nor would heaven be happiness to the impure. As God cannot endure to look upon their iniquity, so they cannot look upon his purity. 7. The peace-makers are happy. They love, and desire, and delight in peace; and study to be quiet. They keep the peace that it be not broken, and recover it when it is broken. If the peace-makers are blessed, woe to the peace-breakers! 8. Those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake are happy. This saying is peculiar to Christianity; and it is more largely insisted upon than any of the rest. Yet there is nothing in our sufferings that can merit of God; but God will provide that those who lose for him, though life itself, shall not lose by him in the end. Blessed Jesus! how different are thy maxims from those of men of this world! They call the proud happy, and admire the gay, the rich, the powerful, and the victorious. May we find mercy from the Lord; may we be owned as his children, and inherit his kingdom. With these enjoyments and hopes, we may cheerfully welcome low or painful circumstances.</body></html>
