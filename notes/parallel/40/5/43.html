But it can hardly be said these words, as far as national enemies were concerned, were foreign to the spirit of the Law. The Israelites were practically commanded to hate the Canaanites and Amalekites, whom they were commissioned to destroy. The fault of the scribes was that they stereotyped the Law, which was in its nature transitory, and extended it in a wrong direction by making it the plea for indulgence in private enmities. Our Lord cancels the Rabbinic gloss as regards national and, <span class= "ital">a fortiori,</span> private hatreds, and teaches us to strive after the ideal excellence which He realised, and to love, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to seek the good of those who have shown us the most bitter hostility. So He taught men to find a neighbour even in a Samaritan, and so He prayed, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 43-48.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">treatment of those who injure us.</span> (Cf. <span class="accented">supra</span>, <span class="accented">ver.</span> 38.) Our Lord now turns from the reception of injuries to the treatment of those who injure us. We are not to injure them in return, nor merely to keep aloof from them, but to show them positive kindness. The Law, in the natural development of it current at the time, taught very differently. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span>. - Matthew only. <span class="cmt_word">Ye</span> <span class="cmt_word">have heard</span> (ver. 21, note). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy</span>. The first clause is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, the second is the natural, and, from one point of view, legitimate, deduction from it. "The whole precept, as it stands, undoubtedly represents, and is a summary of, the sense of the Law" (Mozley, <span class="accented">vide infra</span>). The meaning of the words "neighbour" and "enemy" has been much discussed. In Leviticus, indeed, the meaning of "neighbour" is clear; it answers to "the children of thy people" in the preceding clause, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it refers to members of the nation; all Israelites are termed "neighbours." The primary sense, therefore, of this whole precept is love to an Israelite, hatred to a non-Israelite (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a>). As such, the precept was of value in cementing the unity of the nation and preventing greater exposure to the evils, moral and religious, found outside it. But as quoted by our Lord, it has evidently a more private reference. He treats the precept as referring to personal friends (those who act in a neighbourly way) and enemies, and even this is, in some respects, a legitimate summary of the teaching of the Law, in so far as it forms another side of the law of retaliation. In days when public justice was weak much had to be left to the action of the individual, and he who was wronged was bid satisfy justice by retaliating on his enemy. That, however, it was not the only teaching of the Law is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-29.htm">Job 31:29</a>). But as regards both aspects of the precept the time had come for a change. The Jews only too gladly showed obedience to the second part of the precept, making themselves proverbial (cf. Tacitus, 'Hist.,' 5:5. 2; Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 14:103) for their more than incivility to Gentiles, and they seem to have also zealously carried it out towards their personal enemies (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109.htm">Psalm 109</a>.). On the whole subject, <span class="accented">vide</span> especially Mozley ('Ruling Ideas,' pp. 188-200), who, however, hardly allows enough weight to passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:43-48 The Jewish teachers by neighbour understood only those who were of their own country, nation, and religion, whom they were pleased to look upon as their friends. The Lord Jesus teaches that we must do all the real kindness we can to all, especially to their souls. We must pray for them. While many will render good for good, we must render good for evil; and this will speak a nobler principle than most men act by. Others salute their brethren, and embrace those of their own party, and way, and opinion, but we must not so confine our respect. It is the duty of Christians to desire, and aim at, and press towards perfection in grace and holiness. And therein we must study to conform ourselves to the example of our heavenly Father, 1Pe 1:15,16. Surely more is to be expected from the followers of Christ than from others; surely more will be found in them than in others. Let us beg of God to enable us to prove ourselves his children.</body></html>
