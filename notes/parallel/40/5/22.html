It was this probably that, more than anything else, led to the feeling of wonder expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/7-28.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:">Matthew 7:28-29</a>. The scribe in his teaching invariably referred to this Rabbi and that; the new Teacher spoke as one having a higher authority of His own.<p><span class= "bld">Angry . . . without a cause.</span>--The last three words are wanting in many of the best MSS. They may have been inserted to soften down the apparent harshness of the teaching; but if so, it must have been at an early date--before the fourth century. They may, on the other hand, have been in the text originally, and struck out, as giving too wide a margin to vain and vague excuses. Ethically, the teaching is not that the emotion of anger, with or without a cause, stands on the same level of guilt with murder, but that the former so soon expands and explodes into the latter, that it will be brought to trial and sentenced according to the merits of each case, the occasion of the anger, the degree in which it has been checked or cherished, and the like. As no earthly tribunal can take cognisance of emotions as such, the "judgment" here is clearly that of the Unseen Judge dealing with offences which in His eyes are of the same character as those which come before the human judges. "Hates any man the thing he would not kill?"<p><span class= "bld">Raca.</span>--As far as the dictionary sense of the word goes, it is the same as that of the "<span class= "ital">vain</span> fellows" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/9-4.htm" title="And they gave him three score and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.">Judges 9:4, Jdg_11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-11.htm" title="He that tills his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that follows vain persons is void of understanding.">Proverbs 12:11</a>; but all words of abuse depend for their full force on popular association, and <span class= "ital">raca,</span> like words of kindred meaning among ourselves, was in common use as expressing not anger only but insolent contempt. The temper condemned is that in which anger has so far gained the mastery that we no longer recognise a "brother" in the man who has offended us, but look on him with malignant scorn.<p><span class= "bld">The council.</span>--Offences of this kind are placed by our Lord on the same level as those which came before the great court of the Sanhedrim. That word, though it looks like Hebrew, is really only a transliterated form of the Greek word for council. The court consisted of seventy or seventy-two members, with a president and vice-president, and was made up of the heads of the twenty-four courses of the priests, with forty-six or forty-eight (how chosen it is not known) from the "elders" and "scribes." Like the Areopagus at Athens, it took cognisance--as in the case of our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-65.htm" title="Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He has spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.">Matthew 26:65</a>) and Stephen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-13.htm" title="And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceases not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:">Acts 6:13</a>)--of blasphemy and other like offences, and its peculiar prerogative was that it could order death by stoning. The point of our Lord's teaching was, therefore, that to scorn God's image in man is to do dishonour to God Himself. We cannot truly "fear God" unless we also "honour all men" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-17.htm" title="Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.">1Peter 2:17</a>). The reverence for humanity as such must extend even to the man who has most provoked us. In the unseen eternal world the want of that reverence has its own appropriate punishment.<p><span class= "bld">Thou fool.</span>--The Greek word so rendered agrees accidentally in its consonants with the Hebrew word translated "rebel" (m're) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-10.htm" title="And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said to them, Hear now, you rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?">Numbers 20:10</a>, and hence it has been thought by some that we have here, as with <span class= "ital">raca,</span> a common <span class= "ital">Hebrew</span> term of opprobrium. There is no evidence, however, that the word was thus used, and it is more probable that the Greek is a translation of some word which, like the "fool" of the Old Testament, implied, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm" title="The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that does good.">Psalm 14:1</a>, utter godlessness as well as lack of intellectual wisdom. With that meaning it embodied the temper, not, like that represented by<span class= "ital"> raca,</span> of petulant contempt, but of fixed and settled hatred. That it was the temper and not the utterance of the mere syllables which our Lord condemned is seen in that He Himself used the word of the scribes and Pharisees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-17.htm" title="You fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?">Matthew 23:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-19.htm" title="You fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift?">Matthew 23:19</a>), and St. Paul of the sceptical Greek materialist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-36.htm" title="You fool, that which you sow is not quickened, except it die:">1Corinthians 15:36</a>). The self-same word might spring from a righteous indignation or from malignant hatred.<p><span class= "bld">Of hell fire.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">of the Gehenna of fire.</span> Great confusion has arisen here and elsewhere from the use of the same English word for two Greek words of very different meanings: (1) <span class= "ital">Hades,</span> answering to the <span class= "ital">Sheol</span> (also for the most part translated "hell") of the Old Testament, the unseen world, the region or state of the dead, without any reference to their blessedness or misery; (2) <span class= "ital">Gehenna,</span> which had come to represent among the later Jews (not in the time of any Old Testament writer) the place of future punishment. The history of the word is worth studying. Originally, it was the Greek form of <span class= "ital">Ge-hinnom</span> (the Valley of Hinnom, sometimes of the "son" or the "children" of Hinnom), and was applied to a narrow gorge on the south of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-8.htm" title="And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom to the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:">Joshua 15:8</a>). There Solomon erected a high place for Molech (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-7.htm" title="Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.">1Kings 11:7</a>). There the fires of that god had received their bloody offerings of infant sacrifice under Ahaz and Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-3.htm" title="But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yes, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel.">2Kings 16:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-3.htm" title="Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.">2Chronicles 28:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-6.htm" title="And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he worked much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.">2Chronicles 33:6</a>). Josiah, in his great work of reformation, defiled it, probably by casting the bones of the dead and other filth upon it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/23-10.htm" title="And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.">2Kings 23:10-14</a>); and the Jews on their return from captivity showed their abhorrence of the idolatry of their fathers by making it, as it were, the place where they cast out all the refuse of the city. Outwardly, it must have been foul to sight and smell, and thus it became, before our Lord's time, a parable of the final state of those in whom all has become vile and refuse. The thought first appears in the Targum or Paraphrase of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-14.htm" title="The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness has surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?">Isaiah 33:14</a> ("Gehenna is the eternal fire"). It is often said that fires which were kept burning to consume the solid refuse added to the horror of the scene; but of this, though it is suggested by this passage and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-48.htm" title="Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.">Mark 9:48</a>. there is no adequate evidence. Here the analogy of the previous clauses suggests also the thought that the bodies of great criminals were sometimes deprived of burial rites, and cast out into the Valley of Hinnom; but of this, too, there is no evidence, though it is in itself probable enough. In any case, the meaning of the clause is obvious. Our passing words, expressing states of feeling, and not the overt act of murder only, are subject to the judgment of the Eternal Judge, and may bring us into a guilt and a penalty like that of the vilest criminals.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I say unto you</span>. "I" emphatic (as also in vers. 28, 32, 34, 39, 44), in contrast to God, <span class="accented">as God's utterance was then conditioned</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in contrast to God's voice to and through Moses (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-17.htm">John 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-23.htm">John 7:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-28.htm">Hebrews 10:28, 29</a>). Christ claims for his words the same authority, and more than the same authority, as for those spoken once by God. The circumstances had altered; the message for <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> was insufficient now. Christ brings his own Personality forward, and claims to give a more perfect and far-reaching statement of the sixth commandment than the current form of its teaching, notwithstanding the fact that this current form represented truly the original thought underlying its promulgation. In the following words our Lord speaks of three grades of auger, and, as answering to them, of three grades of punishment. The former will be examined under the several terms employed. Upon the latter it is necessary to make a few remarks here. They have been very variously understood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> "The judgment" means the judgment of God alone, for he alone can take cognizance of mere anger; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> "the council" means the judgment of the Sanhedrin, "a publick tryal;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> "the Gehenna of fire" means the judgment of hell (Lightfoot, 'Hor. Hebr.,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> "The judgment" means the local court; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> "the council" means the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> "the Gehenna of fire" means hell (apparently Nosgen, and many other, especially Romish, expositors). It will be noticed that both the above interpretations are inconsistent. They make our Lord pass from literal to figurative language in the same sentence. Besides, in the second it is inexplicable how mere anger could be brought under the cognizance of a human court. For these reasons it is probable that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> all three stages express metaphorically grades of Divine judgment under the form of the Jewish processes of law. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> "The judgment" primarily means the local court; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> "the council "primarily means the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> "the Gehenna of fire" primarily means the Valley of Hinnom, where the last processes of judgment seem to have taken place (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>). Christ does not say that the sins spoken of render a man liable to any of these earthly processes of law; he says that they render him liable to processes of Divine law which are fittingly symbolized by these expressions. (So Alford, Mansel, and especially Trench, 'Sermon on the Mount,' p. 190). <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever is angry</span>; Revised Version, more precisely, every one who (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). This form of expression is specially frequent in 1 John, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> 3:3, where Bishop Westcott says, "In each case where this characteristic form of language occurs there is apparently a reference to some who had questioned the application of a general principle in particular cases," (For the thought of this clause, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-15.htm">1 John 3:15</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">With his brother.</span> The term "brother" was applied in both Greek and Hebrew, by way of metaphor, to things that possessed merely such fellowship as arises from juxtaposition or from similarity of purpose (cf. of the cherubim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>, "with their faces one to another," literally, "each (man) to his brother"). It is thus possible that here the thought is of any person with whom one is brought into temporary relation, quite apart from any question of a common source. Yet as this could have been represented by "neighbour" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-19.htm">Matthew 19:19</a>), it seems reasonable to see something more in "brother," and to view it with reference to its implied meaning, "fellowship of life based on identity of origin" (Cremer). To Jews as such the term would doubtless only suggest identity of origin nationally, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a fellow-Jew (cf. especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-17.htm">Leviticus 19:17</a>a with 16, 17b, 18; so even <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-10.htm">Malachi 2:10</a>); but to Christians of the time when the Gospel was written rather identity of spiritual origin, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a fellow-Christian. Probably when the expression fell from Christ's lips not one of those who heard him imagined that it could have any wider meaning than fellow-Jew or fellow-believer on Jesus, and probably most of them limited it to the former. In fact, Christ seems to have used it as a means whereby to lead up his hearers from the idea of a national to that of a spiritual relation (cf. vers. 47, 48). We are therefore hardly warranted (far-reaching as the word on Christ's lips is) in seeing here any reference to the thought of the universal brotherhood of man, based on the fact of all being children of one common Father (cf. further Bishop Westcott, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-9.htm">1 John 2:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Without a</span> <span class="cmt_word">cause</span>. Omitted by the Revised Version; Revised Version margin, "many ancient authorities insert <span class="accented">without cause."</span> The <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;</span>, though found in the Old Latin and Old Syriac, is certainly to be omitted, with R, B, and Vulgate, notwithstanding Dean Burgon ('Revision,' p. 358); cf. especially Westcott and Hurt, 'App.' It is redundant, because the two following expressions show that the anger itself is unloving and hostile (cf. further Meyer). There is a holy anger, but that is with a brother's sin, not with the brother himself (cf. Augustine, in Trench, 'Sermon on the Mount'). <span class="cmt_word">Shall be in danger of the judgment</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of God's wrath as symbolized by the lowest degree of Jewish trial (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And whosoever</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;</span>). For in this case there was no need for the emphasizing inclusiveness of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Raca</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Augustine's explanation (in los.; vide Trench; cf. also 'In Joann. Evang.,' &sect; 51:2; 'De Doctr. Christ.,' 2:11), which he got "a quodam Hebraeo," that <span class="accented">Raca</span> is in itself meaningless, and is only an interjection expressing indignation, as "Heu!" sorrow, or "Hem!" anger, or "Hosanna" (!) joy, will hardly commend itself to us to-day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Nor will Chrysostom's (<span class="accented">in loc</span>.; vide Chase's admirable monograph on Chrysostom (1887), p. 133), "As we in giving orders to a servant or to some one of mean rank, say, Go you; take <span class="accented">you this message</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;</span>), so those who use the Syrian language used <span class="accented">Raca</span>, an equivalent to our you (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;</span>);' seem much better, whether we take him as considering it as meaningless, or as in some way confusing its ending with the Shemitic suffix for "thee" (ka). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Ewald explains it by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5e7;&#x5e2;&#x5d0;</span>, "rascal" (<span class="accented">vide</span> Meyer); but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> it is more probably the Aramaic <span class="aramaic">&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5e7;&#x5d0;</span> <span class="accented">reka</span> "empty;" cf.

St. James uses its equivalent (<span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;</span>, 2:20) in solemn warning; but it was not infrequently used as a mere term of angry abuse (cf. Lightfoot, ' Hor. Hebr.,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>, and Levy, s.v.). Buxtorf, <span class="accented">s.v.</span>, compares a favourite expression of Aben Ezra's, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5e7;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>, "empty-heads," for those who raise senseless objections, etc.; but the simple expression in our text refers rather to moral deficiency thorn to deficiency of brain. <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">council</span> (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>But</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">and.</span> The Authorized Version interpolates an emphasis on the climax. <span class="cmt_word">Thou fool</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> This is probably the Greek word for "fool," equivalent to the Hebrew <span class="accented">nabal</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>), which was often used in the Old Testament of the folly of wickedness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-25.htm">1 Samuel 25:25</a>). In this sense <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is used by our Lord himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-17.htm">Matthew 23:17</a> [19]). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It may be the transliteration (cf. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5db;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>) of the Hebrew <span class="accented">moreh</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d4;</span>), "rebel" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-10.htm">Numbers 20:10</a>). (So Revised Version margin, Weiss. Nosgen.) In favour of this is the parallelism cf. language with <span class="accented">Raca.</span> The sense, too, is excellent, "Thou rebel against God!" It is almost equivalent to "Apostate!" But the absence of any evidence that the Jews used <span class="accented">moreh</span> as a term of abuse prevents our accepting this interpretation. Field ('Otium Norv.,' 3.) points out that if this interpretation were true, <span class="accented">moreh</span> would be "the <span class="accented">only</span> pure Hebrew word in the Greek Testament (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x1ffd;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;</span>, as being taken from the LXX., belong to a different class), all other foreign words being indisputably Aramaic, as <span class="accented">raca</span>, <span class="accented">talitha kumi</span>, <span class="accented">maranatha</span>, etc., which, as might have been expected, are retained by the authors of the Syriac versions without alteration. Not so <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x37e;</span>, for which both the Peschito and Philoxenian versions have <span class="accented">lelo</span> ()... a plain proof that these learned Syrians look it for an exotic, and not like <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;</span>, a native word." In either case. the term expresses the absolute godlessness of him who is so addressed. Of the two terms, <span class="accented">Raca</span> is more negative, implying the absence of all good, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;</span> more positive, implying decided wickedness. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be in danger of</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>. The change from the usual dative to the unique construction with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, indicated by the Revised Version margin, "Greek, unto or into," is doubtless because our Lord no longer refers to the tribunal at which the punishment is ordered, but to the punishment itself into which the condemned man comes (cf. Wirier, &sect; 31:5). <span class="cmt_word">Hell fire</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">the hell of fire</span>; Revised Version margin, "Greek, Gehenna of fire" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). Gehenna is properly "the Valley of Hinnom" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-16.htm">Joshua 18:16</a>b; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-30.htm">Nehemiah 11:30</a>), or "of the son of Hinnom" (Joshuaxv. 8; 16:18a; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>). It is probably the valley on the south-west of Jerusalem (see, however, W. F. Birch, in Palestine Exploration Fund Report, January, 1889, pp. 39, 42, who places it between the two parts of Jerusalem, identifying it with the Tyropoeon Valley of Josephus, neglecting, however, to explain how so central a position is consistent with the "fire." In it was the spot where human sacrifices were offered to Moloch (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>; and Rawlinson, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>), called the Topheth, "the place of horror" (<span class="accented">vide</span> especially Payne Smith, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>); and in it, presumably on the same place, were burnt, according to Jewish tradition (<span class="accented">vide</span> especially Kimchi, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>), the carcases of animals and other offal. There is no direct evidence that the bodies of criminals (as is often stated) were burnt there. But it seems probable that it was in this place that death by "burning," whether it was the later method of "burning" by a red-hot wire, or the earlier (Mishna, 'San-hedr.,' 7:2) of lighting faggots of wood round the condemned person, would be carried into effect. Thus both from the old associations of the valley, and from the then use made of it, the epithet "of fire" would be very naturally added. It seems probable that our Lord here referred primarily to "Gehenna" in this local sense (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>), but it is fair to notice that there is no other instance in the New Testament of this literal usage of the word. Elsewhere it is always in the metaphorical sense common in rabbinic writings of the place of final punishment which we usually call "hell." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:21-26 The Jewish teachers had taught, that nothing except actual murder was forbidden by the sixth commandment. Thus they explained away its spiritual meaning. Christ showed the full meaning of this commandment; according to which we must be judged hereafter, and therefore ought to be ruled now. All rash anger is heart murder. By our brother, here, we are to understand any person, though ever so much below us, for we are all made of one blood. Raca, is a scornful word, and comes from pride: Thou fool, is a spiteful word, and comes from hatred. Malicious slanders and censures are poison that kills secretly and slowly. Christ told them that how light soever they made of these sins, they would certainly be called into judgment for them. We ought carefully to preserve Christian love and peace with all our brethren; and if at any time there is a quarrel, we should confess our fault, humble ourselves to our brother, making or offering satisfaction for wrong done in word or deed: and we should do this quickly; because, till this is done, we are unfit for communion with God in holy ordinances. And when we are preparing for any religious exercises, it is good for us to make that an occasion of serious reflection and self-examination. What is here said is very applicable to our being reconciled to God through Christ. While we are alive, we are in the way to his judgement-seat; after death, it will be too late. When we consider the importance of the case, and the uncertainty of life, how needful it is to seek peace with God, without delay!</body></html>
