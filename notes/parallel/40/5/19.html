The usage of the time, however, confined the word to the moral laws of God (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/32-23.htm" title="In every good work trust thy own soul; for this is the keeping of the commandments.">Ecclesiasticus 32:23-24</a>), and throughout the New Testament it is never used in any other sense, with the possible exception of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-5.htm" title="And truly they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:">Hebrews 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-16.htm" title="Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.">Hebrews 7:16</a> (comp. especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-9.htm" title="For this, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, You shall not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.">Romans 13:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-19.htm" title="Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.">1Corinthians 7:19</a>). And the context, which proceeds at once to deal with moral laws and does not touch on ceremonial, is in accordance with this meaning. The "least commandments," then, are those which seemed trivial, yet were really great--the control of thoughts, desires, words, as compared with the apparently greater commands that dealt with acts. The reference to "teaching" shows that our Lord was speaking to His disciples, as the future instructors of mankind, and the obvious import of His words is that they were to raise, not lower, the standard of righteousness which had been recognised previously.<p><span class= "bld">Shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven.</span>--The consequence of tampering with the great laws of duty, or the least laws, which are practically great, is described in terms at once severe and gentle; gentle, because the sentence, where the guilt is not wilful, or is repented of, is not one of absolute exclusion from the kingdom; severe in so far as being the "least" in that kingdom, the object of pity or sorrow to others, involved a severe humiliation to those who aimed at being the highest. To that condemnation many in every age of the Church have been liable, the Anthiomian fanatic and the Jesuit casuist standing so far on the same footing.<p><span class= "bld">Whosoever shall do and teach.</span>--Here again the teaching work of the disciples is prominent. The combination is in this case even more significant than in the other. Not right doing only, still less right teaching only, but both together, made up the ideal of the preacher's work.<p><span class= "bld">Great.</span>--Not "greatest." The avoidance of the latter word, interpreted by the later teaching of 18:4, would seem to have been deliberate. Men might aim at a positive standard of the greatness of the true teacher and the true worker, but the conscious aim at being "greatest" was self-frustrating. That honour belonged to him only who was all unconscious that he had any claim to it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - Matthew only. As Christ honoured the Law (ver. 17) so are his disciples to honour it. <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever therefore</span>. Seeing that every part of the Law is of permanent value. In this verse our Lord once for all declares his opposition to antinomianism. Every one of the commands in the Law is, in its true and ideal meaning, still binding. <span class="cmt_word">Shall break</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>). Not merely in contrast to "do" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span> <span class="accented">vide infra</span>) in the sense of "transgress" (Fritzsche), but "abrogate" (cf. Bishop Westcott, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-18.htm">John 5:18</a>, "Not the violation of the sanctity of the day in a special case, but the abrogation of the duty of observance;" cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-19.htm">Matthew 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-18.htm">Matthew 18:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>). It expresses, indeed, a less complete abrogation than <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (ver. 17), because, while speaking of himself, the Lord could use the strongest word possible, and that with reference to the whole Law or the Prophets; but here his expression is limited by the inability of any individual disciple to carry out an abrogation even of one command<span class="cmt_word">. One of these least commandments.</span> Not necessarily such as the Pharisees reckoned least, in their enumeration of small and great, but such as our Lord himself symbolized by "jot" or "tittle;" those precepts which in reality are the least important (Meyer). Chrysostom strangely says that our Lord here refers, not to old laws, but to those which he was about to lay down; similarly Bengel thinks of vers. 22-28, etc. While the Jews distinguished carefully between small and great precepts, they insisted on the importance of keeping even the smallest; cf. 'Ab.,' 4:5 (Taylor), "Hasten to a slight precept.., for the reward of precept is precept." <span class="cmt_word">And shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">teach men so.</span> Doing his best to abrogate it, not only in his own person by neglect or violation, but also for others by teaching them to disregard it. <span class="cmt_word">He shall be called the least</span>. The Revised Version omits "he, .... the." He is not cast out of the kingdom ("Ubi nisi magni esse non possunt," Augustine), but his want of moral insight (did he consider it "breadth of thought"?) leads to his being called <span class="accented">least</span> in the kingdom. It is the converse of the parable in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-17.htm">Luke 19:17</a>, etc. There faithfulness in a very little (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>) wins much; here disregard of a very little causes a person to be reckoned (ver. 9, note) as very little - the principle of judgment being that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>, "He that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and he that is unrighteous in avery little is unrighteous also in much." <span class="cmt_word">In the kingdom of heaven</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> probably in its full and final establishment. The doctrine of grades of blessedness and of punishment hereafter is clearly taught in Scripture (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47, 48</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But whosoever shall do and teach them</span>. Similarly the Revised Version; but rather supply "it," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "that which is required in the smallest commandment" (Meyer). The personal performance and conscious spreading of one of the least commandments will be found to involve so much that it gains for the person a high position. <span class="cmt_word">Do and teach</span>. For many will perform a command without taking any conscious part in spreading it. <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">same;</span> Revised Version, he (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). Why inserted here and not in the previous clause? Partly because of the awkwardness of inserting <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> there so soon after <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>; partly because our Lord wished to lay stress there on the recompense, here on the person ("he and no other") who receives recompense. On the thought, cf. 'Test. XII. Parr.' (Levi., &sect; 13), "If he teach these things and practise them, he shall share the throne of the king, as also Joseph our brother." It is worth adding Tyndale's remark in his 'Exposition,' "Whosoever shall first fulfil them [these least commandments following] himself, and then teach other, and set all his study to the furtherance and maintaining of them, that doctor shall all they of the kingdom of heaven have in price, and follow him and seek him out, as doth an eagle her prey, and cleave to him as burrs." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:17-20 Let none suppose that Christ allows his people to trifle with any commands of God's holy law. No sinner partakes of Christ's justifying righteousness, till he repents of his evil deeds. The mercy revealed in the gospel leads the believer to still deeper self-abhorrence. The law is the Christian's rule of duty, and he delights therein. If a man, pretending to be Christ's disciple, encourages himself in any allowed disobedience to the holy law of God, or teaches others to do the same, whatever his station or reputation among men may be, he can be no true disciple. Christ's righteousness, imputed to us by faith alone, is needed by every one that enters the kingdom of grace or of glory; but the new creation of the heart to holiness, produces a thorough change in a man's temper and conduct.</body></html>
