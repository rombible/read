The comparison to the "candle" or "lamp" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-15.htm" title="Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it gives light to all that are in the house.">Matthew 5:15</a> shows, indeed, that even here the disciples are spoken of as shining in the world with a derived brightness flowing to them from the Fount of light.<p><span class= "bld">A city that is set on an hill.</span>--Assuming the Sermon on the Mount to have been preached from one of the hills of Galilee near the "horns of Hattin," our Lord may have looked or pointed at Safed, 2,650 feet above the sea, commanding one of the grandest panoramic views in Palestine. It is now one of the four holy cities of the Jews, and probably existed as a fortress in our Lord's time (Thomson's <span class= "ital">The Land and the Book,</span> p. 273). The imagery might, however, come from the prophetic visions of the Zion of the future, idealising the position of the actual Zion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-1.htm" title="But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow to it.">Micah 4:1</a>). No image could so vividly set forth the calling of the Church of Christ as a visible society. For good or for evil, it could not fail to be prominent in the world's history, a city of refuge for the weary, or open to the attacks of the invader.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - Matthew only. <span class="cmt_word">Ye are the light of the world</span>. After speaking of the moral tone that the disciples were to give to the world, in contrast to sin in its corrupting power, Christ refers to them as enlightening, in contrast to sin as darkness and ignorance. Our Lord further naturally exchanges the term "the earth" (which from its strong materialism had suited the figure of the salt) for "the world" - a phrase which must, indeed, as regards the disciples, be limited to this earth, but as regards the light, need not be limited to less than the solar system. In other words, the simple reason why he exchanges "earth" for "world" is that they are respectively the best suited to the figure employed. Notice that Christ never applies the former figure, of salt, to himself; but the latter, of light, once or twice, especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>, where, since he is speaking of himself, and not of others, he adds the thought of life being connected with light, <span class="cmt_word">a</span> <span class="cmt_word">city</span>, etc.; literally, <span class="accented">a city cannot be hid when set on a mountain.</span> It seems at first slightly awkward to introduce the figure of a city between those of the sun and the lamp, both these having to do with light. The reason is that the city is not considered as such, but only as an object which can be teen, and which cannot (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, emphatic) from its physical conditions avoid being seen. There is a true gradation in the thought of influence. The sun must be seen by all; the city, by the whole neighbourhood; the lamp, by the family. Our Lord comes from the general to the particular; from what is almost theory, at best a matter of hope and faith, to hard fact and practice. The influence you are to have - if it is to be for the whole world, as indeed it is, must be felt in the neighbourhood in which you live, and <span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">fortiori</span> in the immediate circle of your own home. Conjectures have been made whether any one city can reasonably be mentioned as being in sight, and so having suggested this image to our Lord. If the exact spot where he was then sitting were itself certain, such conjectures might be worth considering. But, in fact, so many "cities" in Palestine were set on hills that the inquiry seems vain. <span class="accented">Safed</span>, some twelve miles north-west of Capernaum, the view from which extends to Tiberias (Neubaur, 'Geogr.,' p. 228), has been accepted by many, but evidence is lacking for it having been a city at that time. Tabor, at the south-west of the lake, has also been thought of, and at all events seems to have been then a fortified town. The view from it is even more extensive than from <span class="accented">Safed</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> especially Socin's Baedeker, p. 365). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:13-16 Ye are the salt of the earth. Mankind, lying in ignorance and wickedness, were as a vast heap, ready to putrify; but Christ sent forth his disciples, by their lives and doctrines to season it with knowledge and grace. If they are not such as they should be, they are as salt that has lost its savour. If a man can take up the profession of Christ, and yet remain graceless, no other doctrine, no other means, can make him profitable. Our light must shine, by doing such good works as men may see. What is between God and our souls, must be kept to ourselves; but that which is of itself open to the sight of men, we must study to make suitable to our profession, and praiseworthy. We must aim at the glory of God.</body></html>
