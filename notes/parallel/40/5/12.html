The reward is for those only who suffer "for righteousness, for Christ," not for those who are calculating on a future compensation.<p><span class= "bld">In heaven.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">in the heavens,</span> as in the phrase, the "kingdom of heaven." the plural being used possibly with reference to the Jewish belief in three (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.">2Corinthians 12:2</a>) or seven heavens, more probably as implying, in its grand vagueness (like the "many mansions" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-2.htm" title="In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.">John 14:2</a>), the absence of any space limits to the promised reward. As with the "kingdom of heaven," so here, the word is not to be thrown forward into the far-off future, but points to the unseen eternal world which is even now present to us, and of which all true disciples of Christ are citizens (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Philippians 3:20</a>).<p><span class= "bld">So persecuted they the prophets.</span>--Zechariah the son of Jehoiada (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-21.htm" title="And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.">2Chronicles 24:21</a>), Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-21.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek your life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that you die not by our hand:">Jeremiah 11:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-2.htm" title="Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD.">Jeremiah 20:2</a>), and the sufferers in the reign of Ahab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-4.htm" title="For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)">1Kings 18:4</a>), are the great historical instances. Isaiah may be added from tradition. But the words were, we can hardly doubt, true of the prophetic order as a whole. The witnesses for unwelcome truths have never had, anywhere or at any time, a light or easy task. In the words "the prophets which were before you" there is a tacit assumption that the disciples also to whom He spake were called to a prophetic work. There was to be, in part at least, a fulfilment of the old grand wish, "Would God that all the Lord's people were prophets!" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-29.htm" title="And Moses said to him, Envy you for my sake? would God that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit on them!">Numbers 11:29</a>). The Church of Christ, endowed with the Pentecostal gift, was to be as a prophet to the nations.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rejoice, and be exceeding glad</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>). Our Lord uses no weaker expressions than those which describe the joy of the saints over the marriage of the Lamb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>). The first word expresses joy as such, the second its effect in stirring the emotions; this thought St. Luke carries still further in <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>.

The doctrine of recompense, which has so large a place in Jewish thought (for a not often-sire example, cf. 'Ab.,' 2:19, Taylor) comes also in Christ's teaching. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-1.htm">Matthew 20:1-16</a> reward is expressly divested of its merely legal side, and exhibited as ultimately dependent on the will of the great Householder. But here it is mentioned without reference to the difficulties involved in the conception. These difficulties centre round the thought of obligation from God to man. But it may be doubted whether these difficulties are not caused by too exclusively regarding the metaphor of contracting, instead of considering the fact indicated by the metaphor. In God's kingdom every action has a corresponding effect, and this effect is the more certain in proportion as the action is in the sphere of morality. The idea of "quantity" hardly enters into the relation of such cause and effect. It is a question of moral correspondence. But such effect may not unfitly be called by the metaphors "hire," "reward," because, on the one hand, it is the result of conditions of moral service, and, on the other, such terms imply a Personal Will at the back of the effect, as well as a will on the part of the human "servant." (For the subject in other connexions, cf. Weiss, 'Bibl. Theol.,' &sect; 32; cf. also ver. 46; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1, 2, 4, 5, 6</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">In heaven</span>. Our Lord says, "your reward is <span class="accented">great</span>," <span class="accented">because the</span> effect of your exercise of moral powers will be received in a sphere where the accidents of the surroundings will entirely correspond to moral influences. The effect of your present faithfulness, etc., will be seen in the reception Of powers of work and usefulness and enjoyment, beside which those possessed on earth will appear small. On earth the opportunities, etc., are but "few things;" hereafter they will be "many things" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For</span>. Not as giving a reason for the assurance of reward (apparently Meyer and Weiss), but for the command, "rejoice," and be exceeding glad, and perhaps also for the predicate "blessed." Rejoice if persecuted, for such persecutions prove you to be the true successors of the prophets, your predecessors in like faithfulness (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-10.htm">James 5:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">So</span>.

The poor in spirit are happy. These bring their minds to their condition, when it is a low condition. They are humble and lowly in their own eyes. They see their want, bewail their guilt, and thirst after a Redeemer. The kingdom of grace is of such; the kingdom of glory is for them. 2. Those that mourn are happy. That godly sorrow which worketh true repentance, watchfulness, a humble mind, and continual dependence for acceptance on the mercy of God in Christ Jesus, with constant seeking the Holy Spirit, to cleanse away the remaining evil, seems here to be intended. Heaven is the joy of our Lord; a mountain of joy, to which our way is through a vale of tears. Such mourners shall be comforted by their God. 3. The meek are happy. The meek are those who quietly submit to God; who can bear insult; are silent, or return a soft answer; who, in their patience, keep possession of their own souls, when they can scarcely keep possession of anything else. These meek ones are happy, even in this world. Meekness promotes wealth, comfort, and safety, even in this world. 4. Those who hunger and thirst after righteousness are happy. Righteousness is here put for all spiritual blessings. These are purchased for us by the righteousness of Christ, confirmed by the faithfulness of God. Our desires of spiritual blessings must be earnest. Though all desires for grace are not grace, yet such a desire as this, is a desire of God's own raising, and he will not forsake the work of his own hands. 5. The merciful are happy. We must not only bear our own afflictions patiently, but we must do all we can to help those who are in misery. We must have compassion on the souls of others, and help them; pity those who are in sin, and seek to snatch them as brands out of the burning. 6. The pure in heart are happy; for they shall see God. Here holiness and happiness are fully described and put together. The heart must be purified by faith, and kept for God. Create in me such a clean heart, O God. None but the pure are capable of seeing God, nor would heaven be happiness to the impure. As God cannot endure to look upon their iniquity, so they cannot look upon his purity. 7. The peace-makers are happy. They love, and desire, and delight in peace; and study to be quiet. They keep the peace that it be not broken, and recover it when it is broken. If the peace-makers are blessed, woe to the peace-breakers! 8. Those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake are happy. This saying is peculiar to Christianity; and it is more largely insisted upon than any of the rest. Yet there is nothing in our sufferings that can merit of God; but God will provide that those who lose for him, though life itself, shall not lose by him in the end. Blessed Jesus! how different are thy maxims from those of men of this world! They call the proud happy, and admire the gay, the rich, the powerful, and the victorious. May we find mercy from the Lord; may we be owned as his children, and inherit his kingdom. With these enjoyments and hopes, we may cheerfully welcome low or painful circumstances.</body></html>
