The construction is identical with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-12.htm" title="It was said to her, The elder shall serve the younger.">Romans 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-26.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.">Romans 9:26</a><span class= "ital">;</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-16.htm" title="Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He said not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ.">Galatians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-11.htm" title="And white robes were given to every one of them; and it was said to them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brothers, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.">Revelation 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-4.htm" title="And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.">Revelation 9:4</a>. Two questions present themselves for answer: (1) Who were "they of old time"? (2) Who was the speaker of the words quoted? (1) The words are very general, and, as interpreted by the use of "old time" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-21.htm" title="For Moses of old time has in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.">Acts 15:21</a>, seem to point to the time when synagogues began to be established, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> after the return from Babylon. (2) The impersonal form, the contrast between "it was said," and "I say unto you," the tone of authority imposing a new law for that which it supersedes, seem conclusive against referring the words, even when they are found in the Law, to that Law as given by God through Moses. Stress is laid on the words "Ye heard that it was said." "This was the report of the Law given you by your teachers in school and synagogue. I give you another and truer report. Not what you so heard, but what I now say unto you is the true completion of the Law and the Prophets, and therefore the abiding law of my kingdom."<p><span class= "bld">Whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment.</span>--The fact that these words are not found in the Old Testament confirms the view that our Lord is speaking of the traditional comments on the Law, and not of the Law itself. The phrase "in danger" had a somewhat more technical sense in A.D. 1611 than it has now, and meant "legally liable to." The "judgment" spoken of was that of the local courts of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-18.htm" title="Judges and officers shall you make you in all your gates, which the LORD your God gives you, throughout your tribes: and they shall judge the people with just judgment.">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>. They had the power of capital punishment, but the special form of death by stoning was reserved for the Sanhedrim, or Council.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-48.</span> - (<span class="accented">a</span>) Our Lord is still concerned with the relation of himself and his followers to the religion of the day, of which the Old Testament (ver. 17), and more especially the Law (ver. 18), was the accepted standard. But after having spoken of the need of careful attention to (vers. 17,18), and observance of (ver. 19), even the least commands of the Law, he goes on to point out the far-reaching character of these commands, whether they are such as we should call more (vers. 21, 27, 81) or less (vers. 33, 38, 43) impotent. It is essential to notice that our <span class="accented">Lord</span> refers to these commands, not merely as statements contained in the Law, but as part of the religion of the day, and that he contrasts their true bearing on life and conduct with that false bearing on this which was commonly predicated of them. By this it is not meant that our Lord was only opposing such narrow glosses and interpretations as had arisen at various times during the centuries after the promulgation of the Law (for these were for the most part perfectly natural and legitimate developments of the earliest possible interpretations of it), still less that he was thinking only of the worst of the misrepresentations of its commands, comparatively recently made by the Pharisees; but that he was now going back, beyond this so far natural and normal development of the earliest interpretations, to the first principles underlying the revelation contained in the Law. While the Jews, not unnaturally, clung to the primary, but temporary, meaning of the Law as a revelation of God's will for them as a nation, our Lord was now about to expound its commands as a revelation of God's permanent will for them and all men as men. Our Lord was now, that is to say, wishing to do more than merely cut off the excrescences that, chiefly through the Pharisaic party, had grown up round the Law, but less than root up the Law itself. He rather cuts down the whole growth that had been, notwithstanding some mere excrescences, the right and proper outcome of the Law in its original environment, in order that, in fresh environment, which corresponded better to its nature, the Law might produce a growth still more right and proper. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-26.</span> - <span class="accented">The sixth commandment.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-24</span> Matthew only; vers. 25, 26 have parts common to Luke. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye have heard</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, frequentative aorist). Our Lord does not say, "ye have read" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>), for he was not now speaking to the learned classes, but to a large audience many of whom were probably unable to read. "Ye have heard," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from your teachers whose teaching claims to be the substance of the Law. So, probably, even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-34.htm">John 12:34</a>, where the multitude say that they "have heard out of the Law that the Christ abideth for ever," which, since this is hardly expressed in so many words in the Old Testament, must mean that the instructions they have received on this subject truly represent the substance of its teaching. So here our Lord says, "You have heard from your teachers (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-18.htm">Romans 2:18</a>) that the substance of the sixth commandment is so-and-so." It is thus quite intelligible that in some of these utterances there should be found added to (vers. 21, 43) or intermingled with (ver. 33) the words of a passage of Scripture, other words which are <span class="accented">either</span> taken from Scripture, but from another place in it (perhaps ver. 33), or do not occur in Scripture at all, but merely help to form a compendious statement of a definite interpretation (here and ver. 43). It must remain doubtful whether our Lord himself formulated these statements of the popular teaching, or quoted them verbally as current. If the latter, as is perhaps more likely, there remains the at present still more insoluble question whether they were only oral or (cf. the case of the 'Didaehe') had already been committed to writing (cf. in this connexion Bishop Westcott, 'Hebr.,' p. 480). <span class="cmt_word">That it was said by them of old time</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>)<span class="accented">.

Madvig, &sect; 39 <span class="accented">g</span>), "to" (Wickliffe and Tyndale downwards) is certainly right, because <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> it is the common usage with a passive verb; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> it is the constant usage with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> in the New Testament (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-12.htm">Romans 9:12, 26</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> the parallelism with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>., is more exact; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> the popular teaching claimed to be, even in its strictest esoteric form of oral tradition, derived ultimately, not from the words of any human teachers, however primitive, but from the words of God spoken by him to them. In the case before us our Lord accepts the popular teaching of the time as truly representing the Divine utterance in the giving of the Law, so far as that utterance was then intended to be understood. <span class="accented">Them of old time.</span> This can hardly be limited to "the original founders of the Jewish Commonwealth," to use Trench's curiously unbiblical expression ('Syn.,' &sect; 67.). It probably includes all who lived a generation or more before our Lord's time (cf. Weiss). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment.</span> The substance, according to the popular teaching, of the sixth commandment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-17.htm">Deuteronomy 5:17</a>). This the current form of it (based partly on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-21.htm">Leviticus 24:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-12.htm">Deuteronomy 19:12</a>) was that murder was not to be committed, and that if it was committed the murderer was to be brought up for trial. <span class="accented">Shall be in danger of</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in legal danger - legally guilty of a charge which involves the judgment (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-66.htm">Matthew 26:66</a>). <span class="accented">The judgment</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the local Sanhedrin (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-17.htm">Matthew 10:17</a>), of apparently seven men in a smaller, twenty-three in a larger, town (cf. Schurer, II. 1. pp. 149-154). This answers to "the congregation," or "the elders" of the town to which the murderer belonged, before whom he was to be tried (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-12.htm">Numbers 35:12, 16, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-12.htm">Deuteronomy 19:12</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:21-26 The Jewish teachers had taught, that nothing except actual murder was forbidden by the sixth commandment. Thus they explained away its spiritual meaning. Christ showed the full meaning of this commandment; according to which we must be judged hereafter, and therefore ought to be ruled now. All rash anger is heart murder. By our brother, here, we are to understand any person, though ever so much below us, for we are all made of one blood. Raca, is a scornful word, and comes from pride: Thou fool, is a spiteful word, and comes from hatred. Malicious slanders and censures are poison that kills secretly and slowly. Christ told them that how light soever they made of these sins, they would certainly be called into judgment for them. We ought carefully to preserve Christian love and peace with all our brethren; and if at any time there is a quarrel, we should confess our fault, humble ourselves to our brother, making or offering satisfaction for wrong done in word or deed: and we should do this quickly; because, till this is done, we are unfit for communion with God in holy ordinances. And when we are preparing for any religious exercises, it is good for us to make that an occasion of serious reflection and self-examination. What is here said is very applicable to our being reconciled to God through Christ. While we are alive, we are in the way to his judgement-seat; after death, it will be too late. When we consider the importance of the case, and the uncertainty of life, how needful it is to seek peace with God, without delay!</body></html>
