You aim at more, the privileges belonging to the sons of God; therefore do more. <span class="cmt_word">What reward have ye?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> already entered in God's book of account (Winer, &sect; 40:2, <span class="accented">a</span>). <span class="cmt_word">The publicans</span>; Revised Version margin, "That is, <span class="accented">collectors or renters of Roman taxes:</span> and so elsewhere." To this short description little need be added. The Roman system of taxation was to put up the country, or certain productions of the country, at auction, and to "sell" them to any who would undertake to pay the greatest amount of revenue from them (cf. also Josephus's account of the Egyptian method, <span class="date">B.C. 250</span>, 'Ant.,' 12:04. 4; and Sayce's article in the <span class="accented">Jewish Quarterly</span>, July, 1890, on a Jewish taxgatherer at Thebes, <span class="date">B.C. 140</span>). This contract was in turn divided and subdivided, those who actually drew the money from the people being generally natives. It thus being the interest of every contractor and sub-contractor to squeeze as much as possible from those under him, the whole system was demoralizing to all engaged in it. In the case of Judaea it was especially so, as there was a strong feeling among religious Jews against the lawfulness of paying taxes to a Gentile ruler (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-17.htm">Matthew 22:17</a>, note). It is no wonder, therefore, that we find the native collectors (even of districts where the money raised went to Antipas's treasury, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-9.htm">Matthew 9:9</a>, note) classed with "harlots" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-31.htm">Matthew 21:31</a>), "sinners" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-11.htm">Matthew 9:11</a>), the heathen (ver. 4:7; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-17.htm">Matthew 18:17</a>). Yet out of these one was chosen to be among the twelve, and to write that Gospel which specially describes the relation of Jesus of Nazareth to the religious expectations of the nation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:43-48 The Jewish teachers by neighbour understood only those who were of their own country, nation, and religion, whom they were pleased to look upon as their friends. The Lord Jesus teaches that we must do all the real kindness we can to all, especially to their souls. We must pray for them. While many will render good for good, we must render good for evil; and this will speak a nobler principle than most men act by. Others salute their brethren, and embrace those of their own party, and way, and opinion, but we must not so confine our respect. It is the duty of Christians to desire, and aim at, and press towards perfection in grace and holiness. And therein we must study to conform ourselves to the example of our heavenly Father, 1Pe 1:15,16. Surely more is to be expected from the followers of Christ than from others; surely more will be found in them than in others. Let us beg of God to enable us to prove ourselves his children.</body></html>
