The candles of the seven-branched candlestick of the Temple were undoubtedly lamps supplied with oil, and so probably were the "candles" of household use. The word is not the same, however, as that used for the "lamps" of the Wise and Foolish Virgins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-1.htm" title="Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.">Matthew 25:1</a>), and was applied apparently to the cheaper vessels of the poor rather than to those of the wealthy. Wiclif translates it "lantern."<p>The image was drawn from objects familiar to all the hearers, and the presence of the article in the Greek, "under <span class= "ital">the</span> bushel," "on <span class= "ital">the</span> candlestick or lamp-stand," implies the familiarity. Each cottage had one such article of furniture. The "bushel" was a Latin measure, nearly the same as the English peck. It adds to the interest of the illustration to remember that as they were commonly of wood, such articles as these must often have been turned out from the carpenter's shop at Nazareth for the use of its neighbours. It should also be remembered that the self-same word had been applied a short time before by our Lord to the Baptist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-35.htm" title="He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.">John 5:35</a>). His disciples were in this way to continue the Baptist's work.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither do men light a candle,</span> etc. The same illustration comes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-16.htm">Luke 8:16</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-21.htm">Mark 4:21</a>), immediately after the parable of the sower, and again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-33.htm">Luke 11:33</a>, immediately after the reference to the repentance of the men of Nineveh at the preaching of Jonah. All four passages have too much verbal similarity to admit of any of them being absolutely independent. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-21.htm">Mark 4:21</a> has the greatest number of peculiarities. The two passages in Luke agree very closely with each other, but of the two, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-33.htm">Luke 11:33</a> most resembles Matthew. The close agreement here with the context seems to point to this being an original position of the utterance. Of the other two contexts <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-33.htm">Luke 11:33</a>, if we must choose, seems the more natural. Godet, however, says, "This passage has been placed in the sermon on the mount, like so many others, rather because of the association of ideas than from historical reminiscence" (similarly Weiss). <span class="accented">Neither.</span> The inherent position, so to speak, of Christ's disciples, as of a city set on a mountain, is not accidental. It answers to the purpose of their being disciples, as is explained further by the illustration of a lamp. <span class="accented">A candle</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">a lamp</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the flat, saucer-like Eastern lamp, in which sometimes the wick merely floats on the oil <span class="cmt_word">A bushel... a candlestick</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">the bushel</span>... <span class="accented">the stand</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). Probably rightly, for if the article had been generic (cf. Mishna, 'Sabb.,' 4:2, "One may fill a pitcher [literally, 'the pitcher,' <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5e7;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>]. and put it under, a [literally, 'the'] pillow, or under a [literally, the] bolster [on the sabbath in order to take the chill off it]," W.H. Lowe, 'Fragment of Pesachim,' 1879, p. 95; cf. also Driver on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13</a>) it would have been found also before <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. "The description applies to the common houses of the people. In each there was one principal room, in which they ate and slept; the lampstand, with its single light, the flour-bin, and the bed, with a few seats, were all its furniture" (Cook, in 'Speaker's Commentary,' on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-21.htm">Mark 4:21</a> ). <span class="accented">A bushel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). This is probably equivalent to the <span class="accented">seah</span> (so Peshito), which was "the ordinary measure for domestic purposes," and, as slated in the margins of the Authorized and the Revised Versions on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-33.htm">Matthew 13:33</a>, held "nearly a peck and a half" dry measure. The Latin <span class="accented">modius</span>, here used to render <span class="accented">scab</span>, itself held nearly a peck. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-16.htm">Luke 8:16</a> the vaguer term <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used. "Bushel" is retained in the Revised Version probably because it can be used of the vessel apart from all thought of measure; cf. "The Sense represents the Sun no bigger than a Bushel" (Hale [1677], in Murray's 'Oxford Dictionary'). <span class="accented">But on a candlestick</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">but on the stand</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); Vulgate, from Old Latin, <span class="accented">Neque accendunt lucernam et possunt cam sub modio sed super candelabrum. Candelabrum</span> (cf. "chandelier") meant a stand for either candles or lamps; hence Wickliffe, translating from the Vulgate, could say, "Ne me[n] teen-dith not a lanterne & puttith it vndir a buyschel: but on a candilstik." We still use "candlestick" in the rarer sense when we speak of the seven-branched "candlestick" of the tabernacle, which was lighted by lamps, not candies (cf. Humphry, on Revised Version, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>It giveth Light</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">it shineth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). The Rheims alone of the older English versions renders" shine," thus showing that the same Greek word is used as in the next verse. The Vulgate (followed by Wickliffe and Rheims) renders it in the subjunctive, <span class="accented">ut lucent</span>, possibly originally a copyist's error from the <span class="accented">luceat</span> of ver. 16. If so, it was apparently made before the time of Tertullian ('De Prescript.,' &sect; 26). The thought is stir primarily of the light itself being necessarily seen rather than of its benefiting others (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-36.htm">Luke 11:36</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>). To all. For in a room none can help noticing it, even though the lamp and the light itself be but small. The negative of this verse is given in Pseudo-Cyprian, 'De Aleat.,' 3, "Monet dominus et dicit: nolite contris tare Spiritum Sanctum, qui in vobis est, et <span class="accented">nolite exstinguere lumen</span>, <span class="accented">quod in vobis efful sit"</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> Resch, 'Agrapha,' pp. 111, 215). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:13-16 Ye are the salt of the earth. Mankind, lying in ignorance and wickedness, were as a vast heap, ready to putrify; but Christ sent forth his disciples, by their lives and doctrines to season it with knowledge and grace. If they are not such as they should be, they are as salt that has lost its savour. If a man can take up the profession of Christ, and yet remain graceless, no other doctrine, no other means, can make him profitable. Our light must shine, by doing such good works as men may see. What is between God and our souls, must be kept to ourselves; but that which is of itself open to the sight of men, we must study to make suitable to our profession, and praiseworthy. We must aim at the glory of God.</body></html>
