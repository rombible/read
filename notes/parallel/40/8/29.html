It is remarkable that this is the only instance in which that name is addressed to our Lord, though it is used of Him before His birth in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-32.htm" title="He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give to him the throne of his father David:">Luke 1:32</a>. A probable explanation is, that the name "the Most High God" was frequently used in the formulae of exorcism, and so had become familiar to the demoniacs. So, the damsel with a spirit of divination, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-17.htm" title="The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which show to us the way of salvation.">Acts 16:17</a>, speaks of St. Paul and his companions as servants of the Most High God. The question meets us. Was the discernment that led to the confession altogether preternatural, or had the possessed man heard of the fame of Jesus? But if he had only heard, how came he to recognise the Prophet "a great way off?" Possibly the true explanation lies involved in the mystery of the psychological state into which the sufferer had passed under the frightful influences that were working in him.<p><span class= "bld">To torment us before the time.</span>--So the abode of Dives is "a place of torment" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-28.htm" title="For I have five brothers; that he may testify to them, lest they also come into this place of torment.">Luke 16:28</a>), and the ministers of judgment are the "tormentors" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-34.htm" title="And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due to him.">Matthew 18:34</a>). The man identifies himself with the demons; looks forward, when the hour of judgment shall come, to condemnation; and claims, in the meantime, to be let alone. Who that has been called to minister to the souls of men in their demoniac state has not often heard language all but identical? The words added by St. Mark are singularly characteristic: "I adjure thee by God." It is as if the man had listened so often to the formulae of exorcists that they had become, as it were, his natural speech, and he too will try their effect as an adjuration. The command given to the "unclean spirit" to "come out of the man" had, we find from St. Mark and St. Luke, been given previously, as the man drew near, and was the occasion of this frenzied cry.<p>At this stage, too, they add, our Lord asked the question, "What is thy name?" The most terrible phenomenon of possession, as of many forms of insanity, was the divided consciousness which appears in this case. Now the demon speaks, and now the man. The question would recall to the man's mind that he once had a human name, with all its memories of human fellowship. It was a stage, even in spite of the paroxysm that followed, in the process of recovery, in so far as it helped to disentangle him from the confusion between himself and the demons which caused his misery. But, at first, the question seems only to increase the evil: "My name is Legion, for we are many." The irresistible might, the full array of the Roman legion, with its six thousand soldiers, seemed to the demoniac the one adequate symbol of the wild, uncontrollable impulses of passion and of dread that were sweeping through his soul. It would hardly have seemed possible that the force of literalism could have led any interpreter to infer the actual presence of six thousand demons, each with a personality of His own, and to calculate accordingly the number that must have entered into each of the two thousand swine: and yet this has been done.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold</span>. This probably seemed to the evangelist not the least of the many strange things that he introduced by this phrase. <span class="cmt_word">They cried out, saying,</span> <span class="cmt_word">What</span> <span class="cmt_word">have we to do with thee?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5d3;</span>, frequent in the Old Testament, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-10.htm">2 Samuel 16:10</a>). What community either of interest or of character? The deepest realization of personal sinfulness may coexist with absolute ignorance of the Divine love. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus</span>. Omitted by the Revised Version here, yet genuine in the parallel passages, Matthew omitted from their utterance the name which (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>) indicated the bridging of the chasm between the sinner and God. <span class="cmt_word">Thou</span> <span class="cmt_word">Son of God?</span> Their sense of sin, their belief in a future torment, and their use of this phrase, alike point to their being Jews. Observe how great a contrast is implied by this term on the lips of demoniacs. As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a> (cf. Bishop Westcott there), it brings out the nature of the conflict ("the spiritual adversary of man has a mightier spiritual antagonist"), so here. <span class="cmt_word">Art thou come hither</span> - had they felt themselves safe in that distant spot and its gloomy surroundings, far away from all religious influence? <span class="cmt_word">- to torment us before the time?</span> Their abject terror is still more evident in the parallel passages. Observe <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the words are not given as those of the demons, but as the men's own; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> a future torment is assumed; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> they have no doubt as to their own share in it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:28-34 The devils have nothing to do with Christ as a Saviour; they neither have, nor hope for any benefit from him. Oh the depth of this mystery of Divine love; that fallen man has so much to do with Christ, when fallen angels have nothing to do with him! Heb 2:16. Surely here was torment, to be forced to own the excellence that is in Christ, and yet they had no part in him. The devils desire not to have any thing to do with Christ as a Ruler. See whose language those speak, who will have nothing to do with the gospel of Christ. But it is not true that the devils have nothing to do with Christ as a Judge; for they have, and they know it, and thus it is with all the children of men. Satan and his instruments can go no further than he permits; they must quit possession when he commands. They cannot break his hedge of protection about his people; they cannot enter even a swine without his leave. They had leave. God often, for wise and holy ends, permits the efforts of Satan's rage. Thus the devil hurries people to sin; hurries them to what they have resolved against, which they know will be shame and grief to them: miserable is the condition of those who are led captive by him at his will. There are a great many who prefer their swine before the Saviour, and so come short of Christ and salvation by him. They desire Christ to depart out of their hearts, and will not suffer his word to have place in them, because he and his word would destroy their brutish lusts, those swine which they give themselves up to feed. And justly will Christ forsake all that are weary of him; and say hereafter, Depart, ye cursed, to those who now say to the Almighty, Depart from us.</body></html>
