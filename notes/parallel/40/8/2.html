The word, which is Greek and not Hebrew in its origin, has probably been used with varying extent of meaning, sometimes including elephantiasis, or even cancer. Even in its narrower meaning, as used by Hippocrates, leprosy was subdivided into three kinds: (1) the mealy, (2) the white, (3) the black, according to the appearance presented by the portions of diseased flesh. Confining ourselves to the Biblical form of the disease, we note (1) its probable origin in the squalor and wretchedness of the Egyptian bondage. It was the "botch," or plague "of Egypt" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-27.htm" title="The LORD will smite you with the botch of Egypt, and with the tumors, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof you can not be healed.">Deuteronomy 28:27</a>). In the Egyptian legends of the Exodus, indeed, the Israelites were said to have been expelled because they were lepers. (2) Its main features were the appearance of a bright spot on the flesh, whiter than the rest, spreading, in flaming, cracking; an ichorous humour oozing from the cracks, the skin becoming hard, scaly, "as white as snow" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-6.htm" title="And the LORD said furthermore to him, Put now your hand into your bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.">Exodus 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-27.htm" title="The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall stick to you, and to your seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.">2Kings 5:27</a>). One so affected was regarded as unclean; his touch brought defilement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-3.htm" title="And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.">Leviticus 13:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-11.htm" title="It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he is unclean.">Leviticus 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-15.htm" title="And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.">Leviticus 13:15</a>). He was looked upon as smitten with a divine plague, and cases like those of Miriam and Gehazi gave strength to the belief. He had to live apart from his fellows, to wear on his brow the outward sign of separation, to cry out the words of warning, "Unclean, unclean" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-45.htm" title="And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bore, and he shall put a covering on his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.">Leviticus 13:45</a>). The idea which lay at the bottom of this separation seems to have been one of abhorrence rather than precaution. The disease was loathsome, but there is no evidence that it was contagious, or even believed to be contagious. At the stage in which it reached its height, and the whole body was covered with the botch and scabs, the man was, by a strange contrast, declared to be ceremonially clean (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-13.htm" title="Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that has the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.">Leviticus 13:13</a>), and in this state, therefore, the leper might return to his kindred, and take his place among the worshippers of the synagogue. In the case now before us, the man would appear to have been as yet in the intermediate stage. St. Luke describes him, however, as "full of leprosy."<p><span class= "bld">Worshipped him</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as in St. Mark, "falling on his knees," or in St. Luke, "falling on his face," in the highest form of Eastern homage. The act gave to the word "Lord" the emphasis of one, at least, of its higher meanings.<p><span class= "bld">If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</span>--The words imply either that he had seen or heard of our Lord's works of healing, or that His words had impressed him with the belief that the Teacher must have a power extending to acts also. There does not appear to have been any previous case of leprosy miraculously cleansed. The words of the man involve a singular mingling of faith and distrust. He believes in the power, he does not as yet believe in the will. Can it stoop to one so foul as he? If he shared the common feeling that leprosy was the punishment of sin, he might ask: himself, Will He pity and relieve one so sinful?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold</span>. In this case the unexpected (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>, note) was the near approach (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>), the "worship," and the prayer of an outcast. <span class="cmt_word">There came a leper</span>. Loathsome physically and typically. The other passages which speak of the healing of lepers by our Lord or the apostles are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-8.htm">Matthew 10:8</a>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-5.htm">Matthew 11:5</a>; parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-22.htm">Luke 7:22</a>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-12.htm">Luke 17:12</a>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> perhaps <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6</a>; parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And worshipped him</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-9.htm">Matthew 4:9</a>, note). From the parallel passages we may see that the word here refers more to the posture of his body than to the nature of his thoughts. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean</span>. Leprosy stood in so peculiar and solemn a relation to the Israelites that it would hardly be included under the terms, "all manner of disease, and all manner of sickness," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23, 24</a>; we have therefore no evidence that up to this time any leper had been healed by our Lord. The man's utterance marks, therefore, a distinct advance in faith. None like him, the object of the Divine "stroke," had been healed; but from lesser examples of Jesus' power he argues to the greater. Sure of Jesus' power, he appeals to his heart. <span class="cmt_word">Make me clean</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). Not merely "heal me;" for a leper could not but think of healing <span class="accented">and its consequences -</span> restoration to social and religious privileges (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:2-4 In these verses we have an account of Christ's cleansing a leper, who came and worshipped him, as one clothed with Divine power. This cleansing directs us, not only to apply to Christ, who has power over bodily diseases, for the cure of them, but it also teaches us in what manner to apply to him. When we cannot be sure of God's will, we may be sure of his wisdom and mercy. No guilt is so great, but there is that in Christ's blood which atones for it; no corruption so strong, but there is that in his grace which can subdue it. To be made clean we must commend ourselves to his pity; we cannot demand it as a debt, but we must humbly request it as a favour. Those who by faith apply to Christ for mercy and grace, may be sure that he is freely willing to give them the mercy and grace they thus seek. And those afflictions are blessed that bring us to know Christ, and cause us to seek help and salvation from him. Let those who are cleansed from their spiritual leprosy, go to Christ's ministers and open their case, that they may advise, comfort, and pray for them.</body></html>
