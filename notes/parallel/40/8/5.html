The juxtaposition in both cases seems to imply a connection between the teaching and the act that had fixed itself on men's minds. The act was, indeed, chiefly memorable for the teaching to which it led. A comparison of the two narratives suggests the thought that St. Matthew records the miracle more with reference to the associated teaching, St. Luke after more close inquiry into the details and circumstances. Here, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> the centurion is said to have come to our Lord himself; but from St. Luke's report we learn that he never came at all in person, but sent first the elders of the Jews, and then his friends.<p><span class= "bld">A centurion.</span>--The presence of a centurion (a word originally meaning the commander of a hundred soldiers, out, like most words of the kind, afterwards used with a greater latitude of meaning) implied that of a garrison stationed at Capernaum to preserve order. So we find a centurion with his soldiers at Caesarea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-1.htm" title="There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,">Acts 10:1</a>). At Jerusalem, it would appear, it was thought necessary to station a <span class= "ital">Chiliarch,</span> or "chief captain" of a thousand soldiers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-31.htm" title="And as they went about to kill him, tidings came to the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.">Acts 21:31</a>); and the same word meets us as connected with the birthday feast of the Tetrarch Antipas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-21.htm" title="And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;">Mark 6:21</a>).<p>Here, as in the case of Cornelius, the faith and the life of Judaism (seen, we may well believe, to more advantage in the villages of Galilee than amid the factions of Jerusalem) had made a deep impression on the soldier's mind. He found a purity, reverence, simplicity, and nobleness of life which he had not found elsewhere; and so he "loved the nation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-5.htm" title="For he loves our nation, and he has built us a synagogue.">Luke 7:5</a>), and built anew the synagogue of the town. It is probable, as has been already said, that among the ruins of Tell-H-m, identified as Capernaum, we have the remains of the very fabric thus erected. And he, in like manner, had made a favourable impression upon the Jews of that city. They felt his love for them, were ready to go on his errand, to support his prayer with all earnestness, to attest his worth. To one whose work had been, like that of St. Luke, to preach the gospel to the Gentiles, all these incidents would be precious, as early tokens of that breaking-down of barriers, that brotherhood of mankind in Christ, of which the Apostle who was his companion was the great preacher.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-13.</span> <span class="accented">- The healing of the centurion's servant.</span> (Vers. 5-10; parallel passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-1.htm">Luke 7:1-3, 6-10</a>. Vers. 11, 12, equivalent to <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-28.htm">Luke 13:28, 29</a>.) According to St. Luke, the centurion sent first elders of the Jews to plead for him, and afterwards friends, and expressly said by them that he did not think himself worthy to come to Jesus. Their return in ver. 10 seems to forbid the supposition that he eventually came. This detailed narrative seems more likely than St. Matthew's, which is not only compressed, but, if taken by itself, gives a wrong idea of what appears to have actually taken place. But <span class="accented">quod tacit per alium facit per se</span>, and as Trench points out, this is "an exchange of persons, of which all historical narrative and all the language of our common life is full. A comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-35.htm">Mark 10:35</a> with ch. 20:20 will furnish another example of the same." The fact is that St. Matthew (or, perhaps, the original framer of the source that he used, or those through whose hands it passed) seizes on the Gentilic origin of the centurion, without troubling himself to record his previous kind and generous attitude towards the Jews, and the interest that they now show on his behalf. This led to the omission of the second group of messengers also, and, of course, to the modification of the language where necessary, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> ver. 13. For the same reason, St. Matthew records vers. 11, 12 in this place. For the contrast between this and the superficially similar miracle recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-46.htm">John 4:46</a>, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>, cf. Trench on that miracle. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when Jesus</span> (Revised Version, <span class="accented">he</span>) was entered into Capernaum. (On Capernaum, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-13.htm">Matthew 4:13</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">There came unto him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by messengers, as we learn from St. Luke (<span class="accented">vide</span> <span class="accented">supra</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>A centurion, beseeching him</span>. The centurion probably belonged to the soldiers of Antipas, in whose district Capernaum lay. They would naturally be organized after the Roman manner; of the forces of the Indian native states and our own. It should be observed, by the way, that even the imperial troops stationed in Palestine were drawn, not from distant lands, but from the non-Jewish inhabitants of the country, perhaps especially from Samaritans (<span class="accented">vide</span> Schurer, I. 2. p. 50). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:5-13 This centurion was a heathen, a Roman soldier. Though he was a soldier, yet he was a godly man. No man's calling or place will be an excuse for unbelief and sin. See how he states his servant's case. We should concern ourselves for the souls of our children and servants, who are spiritually sick, who feel not spiritual evils, who know not that which is spiritually good; and we should bring them to Christ by faith and prayers. Observe his self-abasement. Humble souls are made more humble by Christ's gracious dealings with them. Observe his great faith. The more diffident we are of ourselves, the stronger will be our confidence in Christ. Herein the centurion owns him to have Divine power, and a full command of all the creatures and powers of nature, as a master over his servants. Such servants we all should be to God; we must go and come, according to the directions of his word and the disposals of his providence. But when the Son of man comes he finds little faith, therefore he finds little fruit. An outward profession may cause us to be called children of the kingdom; but if we rest in that, and have nothing else to show, we shall be cast out. The servant got a cure of his disease, and the master got the approval of his faith. What was said to him, is said to all, Believe, and ye shall receive; only believe. See the power of Christ, and the power of faith. The healing of our souls is at once the effect and evidence of our interest in the blood of Christ.</body></html>
