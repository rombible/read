They are common to St. Mark and St. Luke, but are not narrated, as the following table will show, in the same order:--<p><span class= "bld">ST. MATTHEW.</span><p><span class= "bld">ST.

And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they sought him for her.">Luke 4:38-39</a>).<p>(2.)The servant of the centurion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/8-5.htm" title="And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion, beseeching him,">Matthew 8:5-13</a>).<p>(2.)The leper (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/1-40.htm" title="And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying to him, If you will, you can make me clean.">Mark 1:40-45</a>).<p>(2.)The leper (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/5-12.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and sought him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.">Luke 5:12-15</a>).<p>(3.)Peter's wife's mother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/8-14.htm" title="And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever.">Matthew 8:14-15</a>).<p>(3.)The stilling of the storm Mark (4:35-41).<p>(3.)The servant of the centurion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/7-1.htm" title="Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.">Luke 7:1-10</a>).<p>(4.)The excuses of two disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/8-18.htm" title="Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart to the other side.">Matthew 8:18-22</a>).<p>(4.)The Gadarene demoniac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/5-1.htm" title="And they came over to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.">Mark 5:1-20</a>).<p>(4.)The stilling of the storm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/8-22.htm" title="Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.">Luke 8:22-25</a>).<p>(5.)The stilling of the storm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/8-23.htm" title="And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.">Matthew 8:23-27</a>).<p>--<p>(5.)The Gadarene demoniac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/8-26.htm" title="And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.">Luke 8:26-39</a>).<p>(6.)The Gadarene demoniacs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/8-28.htm" title="And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.">Matthew 8:28-33</a>).<p>--<p>(6.)The excuses of two disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/9-57.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said to him, Lord, I will follow you wherever you go.">Luke 9:57-62</a>).<p>A comparison such as this, especially if we take into account the narratives which in St. Mark and St. Luke come between those which St. Matthew makes to follow close one upon another, and the apparent notes of succession in each case, is enough to show, once for all the difficulty of harmonising the Gospel narratives with any certainty. Three conclusions may fairly be received as all but certain. (1.) The independence of each record. It is scarcely conceivable that St. Mark or St. Luke would have departed so widely from St. Matthew's order had they had his Gospel before them. (2.) The derivation of all three from earlier records, written or oral, each embracing some few acts or discourses of our Lord. (3.) The absence of any direct evidence as to the order of these events, so that each writer was often left to his own discretion, or to some internal principle of grouping.<p>In dealing with such cases, therefore, while the parallel narratives in the other Gospels will be noticed, so far as they make the record here more vivid and complete, there will seldom be any attempt to discuss elaborately the order in which they stand.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1-ch. 9:34</span> - MESSIAH'S WORK AS COMPLEMENTARY TO HIS TEACHING. We return in this section to matter which resembles that of Mark and Luke, and undoubtedly belongs to the Framework (<span class="accented">vide</span> Introduction). St. Matthew has given a lengthy summary of the teaching of the Christ, and he now supplements it by a summary of his daily work. He is not concerned with the chronological connexion of the incidents here narrated, for this is evidently to him a matter of but secondary importance. He only desires to bring out different aspects of the Lord's life. Thus he notices - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Christ's miracles of healing, and the secret of his ability to perform them (vers. 1-17). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The personal trials that Christ incurred in his work (ver. 18-<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-8.htm">Matthew 9:8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The liberty of the gospel as shown by Christ's treatment of the outcast, and his answer to those who insisted on fasting (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-9.htm">Matthew 9:9-17</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The completeness of his healing power (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-18.htm">Matthew 9:18-34</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-17.</span> - 1. <span class="accented">Christ's miracles of healing</span>, <span class="accented">and the secret of his ability to perform them.</span> Observe: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The variety in the patients. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> One of the chosen people, who had lost all social and religious privileges; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> a Gentile, an outsider by birth; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> the near relation of a personal follower; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> multitudes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The variety in the requests for his aid. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> The request by the sufferer; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> the request by another; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> apparently no request, yet the personal follower has Christ with him; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> the sufferers are brought to him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-4.</span> <span class="accented">- Healing the leper.</span> Parallel passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-40.htm">Mark 1:40-45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-12.htm">Luke 5:12-16</a>.

It carries on the thought of the <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> in the last verse of the preceding chapter, and serves to introduce the following examples of sick folk; or, perhaps, it may be connected with the "great multitudes" (<span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-25.htm">Matthew 4:25</a>, coming, as the plural suggests (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-23.htm">Matthew 12:23</a>) from the various places there enumerated. If we must combine this verse with <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-12.htm">Luke 5:12</a>, we must suppose our Lord to have descended the mountain, and to be passing through "one of the cities," coming (our ver. 5) afterwards to Capernaum, the "great multitudes" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-15.htm">Luke 5:15</a>)being drawn from the various cities through which he passed. The verse reminds us that the two sides of the Lord's life, preaching and work, were intimately connected. Men not only wondered at what they heard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28, 29</a>), they also followed him, and this led to occasions for the exercise of his practical activity. The result was that they wondered at his work (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-33.htm">Matthew 9:33</a>), as they wondered at his preaching. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1 This verse refers to the close of the foregoing sermon. Those to whom Christ has made himself known, desire to know more of him.</body></html>
