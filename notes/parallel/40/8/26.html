Of uncertain derivation; tranquillity.</span><br /><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?</span>--St. Luke puts the question more strongly: "Where is your faith?" as though it had all drifted away under the pressure of their fears. Yet the word "of little faith" was singularly appropriate. They had not altogether lost their trust in Him, but they had not learnt the lesson of the centurion's faith, and were only at ease when they heard His voice, and saw that He was watching over them.<p><span class= "bld">Rebuked the winds and the sea.</span>--This seems to have been almost, so to say, our Lord's formula in working miracles. The fever (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-39.htm" title="And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered to them.">Luke 4:39</a>), the frenzy of the demoniac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-25.htm" title="When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying to him, You dumb and deaf spirit, I charge you, come out of him, and enter no more into him.">Mark 9:25</a>), the tempest, are all treated as if they were hostile and rebel forces that needed to be restrained. St. Mark, with his usual vividness, gives the very words of the rebuke: "Peace, be still"--literally, <span class= "ital">be dumb, be muzzled,</span> as though the howling wind was a maniac to be gagged and bound.<p><span class= "bld">There was a great calm.</span>--As with the fever in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-15.htm" title="And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered to them.">Matthew 8:15</a>, so here, the work was at once instantaneous and complete. There was no after-swell such as is commonly seen for hours after a storm.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-30.htm">Matthew 6:30</a>, note). The winds and waves were mastering their souls as well as their bodies. Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea. <span class="accented">-Rebuked</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-7.htm">Psalm 104:7</a>. The words spoken are recorded by St. Mark. And there was a great calm. Corresponding to the "great tempest" (ver. 24). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:23-27 It is a comfort to those who go down to the sea in ships, and are often in perils there, to reflect that they have a Saviour to trust in and pray to, who knows what it is to be on the water, and to be in storms there. Those who are passing with Christ over the ocean of this world, must expect storms. His human nature, like to ours in every thing but sin, was wearied, and he slept at this time to try the faith of his disciples. They, in their fear, came to their Master. Thus is it in a soul; when lusts and temptations are swelling and raging, and God is, as it were, asleep to it, this brings it to the brink of despair. Then it cries for a word from his mouth, Lord Jesus, keep not silence to me, or I am undone. Many that have true faith, are weak in it. Christ's disciples are apt to be disquieted with fears in a stormy day; to torment themselves that things are bad with them, and with dismal thoughts that they will be worse. Great storms of doubt and fear in the soul, under the power of the spirit of bondage, sometimes end in a wonderful calm, created and spoken by the Spirit of adoption. They were astonished. They never saw a storm so turned at once into a perfect calm. He that can do this, can do any thing, which encourages confidence and comfort in him, in the most stormy day, within or without, Isa 26:4.</body></html>
