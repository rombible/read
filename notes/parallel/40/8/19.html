The fact that it was a scribe that came is striking, as showing that the impression made by our Lord's teaching was not confined to the "common people" that "heard him gladly." As Nicodemus had already come confessing that He was a "Teacher come from God," so in Galilee there was one whom the Sermon on the Mount, or some like discourse, had led to volunteer at least the show of discipleship.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-22.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-57.htm">Luke 9:57-62</a>. <span class="accented">The would-be followers.</span> (On this section, cf. by all means Trench, 'Studies in the Gospels,' pp. 156-167: 1867.) Notice that St. Luke <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> places it almost at the beginning of the Great Episode, calling attention by it to the qualifications required of those who would follow the Lord Up to Jerusalem; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> adds a third example. So far as we have materials for deciding, the chronological position found in St. Matthew seems more probable. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And a certain scribe came;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">and there came a scribe.</span> Contrast the order in ver. 2. There the leper was recognized as such before ever he came near, an emphasis being laid on him and his actions by the addition of "Behold;" here the official position is of but secondary importance. <span class="accented">A certain</span>; <span class="accented">a</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c2;</span>. The Hebrew numeral not uncommonly stands for an indefinite article (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-18.htm">Matthew 9:18</a>. [Westcott and Hort]; 26:69). Trench's "<span class="accented">one</span> <span class="accented">scribe</span>... with, perhaps, an emphasis on the 'one' to mark how unfrequent such offers were," is tempting, but improbable. <span class="accented">Scribe.</span> St. Matthew alone records his profession. Perhaps because the distinction of Jewish classes presented itself more vividly to his mind than to St. Luke's. <span class="cmt_word">And said unto him; Master;</span> better, with the Revised Version margin, <span class="accented">teacher</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;</span>). It may be that he recognized one who was superior in an important branch of his own occupation, or, less probably, that he willingly accorded to him a title due to his occupation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>; and <span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-38.htm">Matthew 12:38</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will follow</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> (<span class="accented">not</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). Self is placed in the background; he is wholly taken up with that which he proposes doing. <span class="cmt_word">Whithersoever thou goest</span>. Though, as a scribe, he would naturally prefer quiet. Contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-66.htm">John 6:66</a> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;</span>). But the discomforts would be greater than he expected. Observe, however, that there is no sign. in him of that <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of which he has been accused (Cram. Cat.). Trench strangely favours the suggestion that he was Judas. Is <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-4.htm">Revelation 14:4</a> a reminiscence of this offer? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:18-22 One of the scribes was too hasty in promising; he proffers himself to be a close follower of Christ. He seems to be very resolute. Many resolutions for religion are produced by sudden conviction, and taken up without due consideration; these come to nothing. When this scribe offered to follow Christ, one would think he should have been encouraged; one scribe might do more credit and service than twelve fishermen; but Christ saw his heart, and answered to its thoughts, and therein teaches all how to come to Christ. His resolve seems to have been from a worldly, covetous principle; but Christ had not a place to lay his head on, and if he follows him, he must not expect to fare better than he fared. We have reason to think this scribe went away. Another was too slow. Delay in doing is as bad on the one hand, as hastiness in resolving is on the other. He asked leave to attend his father to his grave, and then he would be at Christ's service. This seemed reasonable, yet it was not right. He had not true zeal for the work. Burying the dead, especially a dead father, is a good work, but it is not thy work at this time. If Christ requires our service, affection even for the nearest and dearest relatives, and for things otherwise our duty, must give way. An unwilling mind never wants an excuse. Jesus said to him, Follow me; and, no doubt, power went with this word to him as to others; he did follow Christ, and cleaved to him. The scribe said, I will follow thee; to this man Christ said, Follow me; comparing them together, it shows that we are brought to Christ by the force of his call to us, Ro 9:16.</body></html>
