St. Mark adds that "they took Him, even as He was, in the boat," the words indicating apparently extreme exhaustion from the fatigue of teaching. This, we learn, was followed by immediate sleep as He lay in the stern on the boat's cushion as a pillow.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-27.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">storm on the lake.</span> Parallel passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-35.htm">Mark 4:35-41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-22.htm">Luke 8:22-25</a>. Matthew, as usual, is both shorter and less precise. Nosgen and others see in this an "undesigned coincidence" with his still being at "the receipt of custom" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-9.htm">Matthew 9:9</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he was entered into a ship</span> (Revised Version, <span class="accented">boat</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>his disciples followed him</span>. Did St. Matthew see in the very order of embarking a symbol of the Christian life? It may be so, but a more probable reason for mentioning the order is that our Lord was, perhaps, on this occasion not using a beat that belonged to any of the disciples. Passage may have been given to him at his request, and of course the disciples went where he went. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:23-27 It is a comfort to those who go down to the sea in ships, and are often in perils there, to reflect that they have a Saviour to trust in and pray to, who knows what it is to be on the water, and to be in storms there. Those who are passing with Christ over the ocean of this world, must expect storms. His human nature, like to ours in every thing but sin, was wearied, and he slept at this time to try the faith of his disciples. They, in their fear, came to their Master. Thus is it in a soul; when lusts and temptations are swelling and raging, and God is, as it were, asleep to it, this brings it to the brink of despair. Then it cries for a word from his mouth, Lord Jesus, keep not silence to me, or I am undone. Many that have true faith, are weak in it. Christ's disciples are apt to be disquieted with fears in a stormy day; to torment themselves that things are bad with them, and with dismal thoughts that they will be worse. Great storms of doubt and fear in the soul, under the power of the spirit of bondage, sometimes end in a wonderful calm, created and spoken by the Spirit of adoption. They were astonished. They never saw a storm so turned at once into a perfect calm. He that can do this, can do any thing, which encourages confidence and comfort in him, in the most stormy day, within or without, Isa 26:4.</body></html>
