The marvel was not without a "great fear" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-41.htm" title="And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?">Mark 4:41</a>). The Presence among them was mightier even than they had thought, and the elements, which seemed far more removed from human control than leprosy or fever, were yet subject to His sovereignty.<p>The spiritual application of the miracle lies so near the surface that it has almost become one of the common-places of sermons and hymns. And yet there is a profound fitness in it which never ceases to be fresh. The boat is the Church of Christ, and it sails across the ocean of the world's history to the "other side" of the life beyond the grave. The wind is the blast of persecution, and the Lord of the Church seems as though He were asleep, and heard not the cry of the sufferers, and the disciples are faint-hearted and afraid. And then He hears their prayer, and the storm of the persecution ceases, and there is a great calm, during which the Church goes on its way, and men learn to feel that it carries more than Caesar and his fortunes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span> (Revised Version, <span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the men</span>. Perhaps the disciples ("Sic als Menschen staunch," Nosgen), but probably those to whom the boat belonged (ver. 23, note), the crew. It seems very far-fetched to explain it of all men who heard of the miracle. <span class="cmt_word">Marvelled</span>. As the multitudes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-33.htm">Matthew 9:33</a>; but contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-33.htm">Matthew 14:33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Saying, What manner of man is this?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). Parallel passages, "Who then?" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>;). The term indicates the slightness of their knowledge of his character (probably not his origin, which, according to Phryn. [Wetstein], would be <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; though it may be doubted whether the distinction can be pressed in Hellenistic Greek). They seem, with Nicodemus, to have recognized that holiness was an essential condition of performing miracles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>), but not to have realized that this condition was satisfied in Jesus. <span class="cmt_word">That even the winds and the sea obey him</span>.

The miracle! has been seen to be a parable of the security of the ship of the Church since at least the days of Tertullian ('De Bapt.,' &sect; 12). (For the comparison generally of the Church to a ship, compare especially Bishop Lightfoot on Ignatius, 'Polyc.,' &sect; it.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:23-27 It is a comfort to those who go down to the sea in ships, and are often in perils there, to reflect that they have a Saviour to trust in and pray to, who knows what it is to be on the water, and to be in storms there. Those who are passing with Christ over the ocean of this world, must expect storms. His human nature, like to ours in every thing but sin, was wearied, and he slept at this time to try the faith of his disciples. They, in their fear, came to their Master. Thus is it in a soul; when lusts and temptations are swelling and raging, and God is, as it were, asleep to it, this brings it to the brink of despair. Then it cries for a word from his mouth, Lord Jesus, keep not silence to me, or I am undone. Many that have true faith, are weak in it. Christ's disciples are apt to be disquieted with fears in a stormy day; to torment themselves that things are bad with them, and with dismal thoughts that they will be worse. Great storms of doubt and fear in the soul, under the power of the spirit of bondage, sometimes end in a wonderful calm, created and spoken by the Spirit of adoption. They were astonished. They never saw a storm so turned at once into a perfect calm. He that can do this, can do any thing, which encourages confidence and comfort in him, in the most stormy day, within or without, Isa 26:4.</body></html>
