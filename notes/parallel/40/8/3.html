St. Mark adds, "Had compassion on him."<p><span class= "bld">Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</span>--We may venture to picture the process to our minds: the skin cleansed, the sores closed, the diseased whiteness giving way to the tints and tones of health.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus put forth</span> (<span class="accented">and he stretched forth</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">his hand, and touched him</span>. The careful record of the twofold action may be either a trace of the increasing astonishment of the bystanders or a means of indicating that this was no accidental touch, but the result of deliberate will (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-31.htm">Matthew 14:31</a>). According to the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-46.htm">Leviticus 13:46</a> with Leviticus 11:40), our Lord by this action would become unclean until the evening. But of this there is no hint. That indeed he could not by it contract any real impurity, or even any ceremonial impurity in the eyes of God, is self-evident. But how could he himself justify his exemption from the Law? and how could the people justify it? Probably both he and they felt that as "<span class="accented">the</span> priests, in their contact with the leper to be adjudged, were exempted from the law of defilement," much more was the One who "cleansed" him. "He says, <span class="accented">I will</span>,' to meet the heresy of Photinus. He <span class="accented">commands</span>, because of <span class="accented">Afius.</span> He <span class="accented">touches</span>, because of Manichseus" (Ambrose, in Ford). <span class="cmt_word">Saying</span>, <span class="cmt_word">I will</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>).

The external power which the man had himself acknowledged was now applied to him, and he was made clean by it, physically and therefore ceremonially (cf. Bishop Westcott, on 'Hebrews,' p. 346). <span class="cmt_word">And immediately his leprosy was cleansed</span>. (On the parallel passage in Mark and Luke, "departed from him," see Professor Marshall, in <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, June, 1891, p. 464). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:2-4 In these verses we have an account of Christ's cleansing a leper, who came and worshipped him, as one clothed with Divine power. This cleansing directs us, not only to apply to Christ, who has power over bodily diseases, for the cure of them, but it also teaches us in what manner to apply to him. When we cannot be sure of God's will, we may be sure of his wisdom and mercy. No guilt is so great, but there is that in Christ's blood which atones for it; no corruption so strong, but there is that in his grace which can subdue it. To be made clean we must commend ourselves to his pity; we cannot demand it as a debt, but we must humbly request it as a favour. Those who by faith apply to Christ for mercy and grace, may be sure that he is freely willing to give them the mercy and grace they thus seek. And those afflictions are blessed that bring us to know Christ, and cause us to seek help and salvation from him. Let those who are cleansed from their spiritual leprosy, go to Christ's ministers and open their case, that they may advise, comfort, and pray for them.</body></html>
