The wind sweeps through the narrow mountain valleys, and the sea, which a few minutes before was smooth as glass, is at once rough with the white crests of the foaming waves. The ship was on the point of sinking, as the waves dashed over it while it was in the trough between them. It was beginning to be filled with water, and still He slept.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>, note). Perhaps when with Jesus they hardly expected a storm. <span class="cmt_word">There arose a great tempest in the</span> sea. St. Matthew records only the effect of the sudden rush (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;</span> in the parallel passages) of the wind down the gorges. <span class="cmt_word">Insomuch that the ship</span> (Revised Version, <span class="accented">boat</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>was covered with the waves</span>. The waves swept again and again clean over the boat. Slowly but surely the boat was filling(parallel passages). <span class="cmt_word">But he was asleep</span>. All the time (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). Yet what a contrast to Jonah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-5.htm">Jonah 1:5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:23-27 It is a comfort to those who go down to the sea in ships, and are often in perils there, to reflect that they have a Saviour to trust in and pray to, who knows what it is to be on the water, and to be in storms there. Those who are passing with Christ over the ocean of this world, must expect storms. His human nature, like to ours in every thing but sin, was wearied, and he slept at this time to try the faith of his disciples. They, in their fear, came to their Master. Thus is it in a soul; when lusts and temptations are swelling and raging, and God is, as it were, asleep to it, this brings it to the brink of despair. Then it cries for a word from his mouth, Lord Jesus, keep not silence to me, or I am undone. Many that have true faith, are weak in it. Christ's disciples are apt to be disquieted with fears in a stormy day; to torment themselves that things are bad with them, and with dismal thoughts that they will be worse. Great storms of doubt and fear in the soul, under the power of the spirit of bondage, sometimes end in a wonderful calm, created and spoken by the Spirit of adoption. They were astonished. They never saw a storm so turned at once into a perfect calm. He that can do this, can do any thing, which encourages confidence and comfort in him, in the most stormy day, within or without, Isa 26:4.</body></html>
