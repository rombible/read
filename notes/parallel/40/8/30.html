But though the Jews did not eat pork, Roman soldiers did, and the swine may have been kept to supply the wants of the legion with which the man was familiar. The pun of Augustus as to Herod's swine and son (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-16.htm" title="Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.">Matthew 2:16</a>) seems to imply that the king kept them on his estates for some such purpose.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30, 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was a good way off from them a herd of many swine feeding. So</span> (and, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">the devils</span> <span class="cmt_word">besought him, saying, If thou cast us out</span> (Matthew only), <span class="cmt_word">suffer us to</span> <span class="cmt_word">go away</span> (<span class="accented">send us away</span>, Revised Version). This is distinguished from ver. 29 as expressly the utterance of the evil spirits. In the true text there is no thought of permission, but only of command (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). They recognize his mastery. <span class="cmt_word">Into</span> <span class="cmt_word">the herd of swine;</span> and not into the place of torment - "the abyss" of the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-31.htm">Luke 8:31</a>. If he did not send them there, they might hope for a long respite, and one perhaps spent in various tenements. Further notice: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The unclean chose the unclean <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Though we cannot attribute to the evil spirits absolute foreknowledge of what would happen in this case, their past experience may have enabled them to feel sure that they would have their love of destroying fully gratified. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> it is also not impossible that they may have considered that their entering the swine would be likely to prejudice the Gerasenes against Jesus. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:28-34 The devils have nothing to do with Christ as a Saviour; they neither have, nor hope for any benefit from him. Oh the depth of this mystery of Divine love; that fallen man has so much to do with Christ, when fallen angels have nothing to do with him! Heb 2:16. Surely here was torment, to be forced to own the excellence that is in Christ, and yet they had no part in him. The devils desire not to have any thing to do with Christ as a Ruler. See whose language those speak, who will have nothing to do with the gospel of Christ. But it is not true that the devils have nothing to do with Christ as a Judge; for they have, and they know it, and thus it is with all the children of men. Satan and his instruments can go no further than he permits; they must quit possession when he commands. They cannot break his hedge of protection about his people; they cannot enter even a swine without his leave. They had leave. God often, for wise and holy ends, permits the efforts of Satan's rage. Thus the devil hurries people to sin; hurries them to what they have resolved against, which they know will be shame and grief to them: miserable is the condition of those who are led captive by him at his will. There are a great many who prefer their swine before the Saviour, and so come short of Christ and salvation by him. They desire Christ to depart out of their hearts, and will not suffer his word to have place in them, because he and his word would destroy their brutish lusts, those swine which they give themselves up to feed. And justly will Christ forsake all that are weary of him; and say hereafter, Depart, ye cursed, to those who now say to the Almighty, Depart from us.</body></html>
