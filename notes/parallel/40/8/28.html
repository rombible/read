In all the three Gospels we find various readings, of which the best supported are Gadarenes in St. Matthew, and Gerasenes in St. Mark and St. Luke. "Gergesenes" is, however, found in some MSS. of high authority, and the variations are obviously of very early date. The main facts as to the three regions thus indicated are as follows:--<p>(1.) Gadara was a city east of the Sea of Galilee, about sixteen miles from Tiberias. It is identified with the modern U<span class= "ital">m Keis,</span> the ruins of which are more than two miles in circumference, and stand at the north-west extremity of the mountains of Gilead, near the south-east corner of the Lake. The tombs of the city, chambers in the limestone rock often more than twenty feet square, are its most conspicuous feature, and are, indeed, the sole abode of its present inhabitants. Under the Roman occupation it was important enough to have two amphitheatres and a long colonnaded street.<p>(2.) Gerasa was a city in the Gilead district, twenty miles east of the Jordan, described sometimes as belonging to C?le-Syria, sometimes to Arabia. It also has ruins which indicate the former splendour of the city. Of these two, it is clear that Gadara fits in better with all the circumstances of the narrative; and if "Gerasenes" is more than the mistake of a transcriber, it could only be because the name was used vaguely for the whole Gilead district. The reading "Gadarenes" in that case would probably come from some one better acquainted with the position of the two cities.<p>(3.) There was no city named Gergesa, but the name Gergesenes was probably connected with the older Girgashites, one of the Canaanite races that occupied the country before the invasion of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-16.htm" title="And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,">Genesis 10:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-21.htm" title="And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.">Genesis 15:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-10.htm" title="And Joshua said, Hereby you shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.">Joshua 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-11.htm" title="And you went over Jordan, and came to Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.">Joshua 24:11</a>; <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Apparently, however, from the last passage referred to, they were on the western side of the Jordan. It is, on the whole, more likely that the reading was a mistake, than that the old tribe still remained with its old name; but it is possible that the name of Gerasa may represent an altered form of <span class= "ital">Girgashim.</span><p><span class= "bld">Two possessed with devils.</span>--St. Mark and St. Luke speak of "one" only. A like difference meets us in St. Matthew's "two blind men" at Jericho (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-30.htm" title="And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, you son of David.">Matthew 20:30</a>) as compared with the "one" of the two other Gospels. The natural explanation is that, in each case, one was more prominent than the other in speech or act, and so was remembered and specified, while the other was either forgotten or left unnoticed. The difference, as far as it goes, is obviously in favour of the independence of St. Matthew's narrative. The "tombs" in the neighbourhood of Gadara, hewn out in the rock, have been already mentioned. To dwell in such tombs was, to the ordinary Jew, a thing from which he shrank with abhorrence, as bringing pollution, and to choose such an abode was therefore a sign of insanity.<p>St. Luke adds that he wore no clothes (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> strictly, no outer garment; the word does not imply actual nakedness). St. Mark (whose account is the fullest of the three) notices that he had often been bound with fetters and chains, and that, with the abnormal strength often found in mania, he had set himself free from them. The insanity was so homicidal that "none could pass by that way," so suicidal that he was ever cutting himself with stones, howling day and night in the wildness of his paroxysms.<p>For a full discussion of the subject of demoniacal possession, see <span class= "ital">Excursus</span> at the end of this Gospel.<p><span class= "bld">III.</span>--<span class= "bld">DEMONIAC POSSESSION (Matthew 8:28).</span><p>(1.) As to the word, the Greek <span class= "greekheb">??????</span> (the "knowing," or the "divider") appears in Homer as interchangeable with <span class= "greekheb">????</span> (God). In the mythology of Hesiod( <span class= "ital">Works and Days,</span> i. 108) we have the first downward step, and the <span class= "greekheb">????????</span> are the departed spirits of the men who lived in the first golden age of the world. They are the good genii of Greek religion, averters of evil, guardians of mortal men. The next stage introduced the neuter of the adjective derived from <span class= "greekheb">??????</span> as something more impersonal, and <span class= "greekheb">?? ????????</span> was used by Plato as something "between God and man, by which the former communicates with the latter" (<span class= "ital">Symp.,</span> p. 202), and in this sense Socrates spoke of the inward oracle whose warning he obeyed, as his <span class= "greekheb">????????</span>, and was accordingly accused of bringing in the worship of new <span class= "greekheb">????????</span>, whom the State had not recognised. The fears of men led them, however, to connect these unknown intermediate agents with evil as well as good. The <span class= "greekheb">??????</span> of the Greek tragedians is the evil genius of a family, as in the case of that of Agamemnon. A man is said to be under its power when he is swayed by some uncontrollable, frenzied passion that hurries him into guilt and misery.<p>Such were the meanings that had gathered round the word when the Greek translators of the Old Testament entered on their task. They, as was natural, carefully avoided using it in any connection that would have identified it with the God of Israel. It appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-3.htm" title="You turn man to destruction; and say, Return, you children of men.">Psalm 90:3</a>, where the English version gives "destruction;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-17.htm" title="They sacrificed to devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.">Deuteronomy 32:17</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-37.htm" title="Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to devils,">Psalm 106:37</a>, where the English version has "devils," and in this sense it accordingly passed into the language of the Hellenistic Jews, and so into that of the writers of the Gospels. So St. Paul speaks of the gods whom the heathen worshipped as <span class= "greekheb">????????</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-20.htm" title="But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that you should have fellowship with devils.">1Corinthians 10:20</a>).<p>(2.) As to the phenomena described, the belief of later Judaism ascribed to "demons," in the sense which the word has thus acquired, many of the more startling forms of bodily and mental suffering which the language of modern thought groups under the general head of "disease." Thus, in the history of Tobit, the daughter of Raguel is possessed by the evil spirit Asmodeus, and he slays her seven bridegrooms (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/tobit/3-8.htm" title="Because that she had been married to seven husbands, whom Asmodeus the evil spirit had killed, before they had lain with her. Dost thou not know, said they, that thou hast strangled thine husbands? thou hast had already seven husbands, neither wast thou named after any of them.">Tobit 3:8</a>). Or passing on to the Gospel records, we find demoniac agency the cause of dumbness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-32.htm" title="As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil.">Matthew 9:32</a>), blindness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-22.htm" title="Then was brought to him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw.">Matthew 12:22</a>), epilepsy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/9-17.htm" title="And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought to you my son, which has a dumb spirit;">Mark 9:17-27</a>), or (as here, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/5-1.htm" title="And they came over to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.">Mark 5:1-5</a>) insanity. To "have a devil" is interchangeable with "being mad" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-20.htm" title="The people answered and said, You have a devil: who goes about to kill you?">John 7:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-48.htm" title="Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Say we not well that you are a Samaritan, and have a devil?">John 8:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-20.htm" title="And many of them said, He has a devil, and is mad; why hear you him?">John 10:20</a>, and probably <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-18.htm" title="For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a devil.">Matthew 11:18</a>). And this apparently was but part of a more general view, which saw in all forms of disease the work, directly or indirectly, of Satan, as the great adversary of mankind. Our Lord went about "healing all that were oppressed of the devil" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-38.htm" title="How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.">Acts 10:38</a>). "Satan had bound" for eighteen years the woman who was crippled by a spirit of infirmity" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-16.htm" title="And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound, see, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?">Luke 13:16</a>). And these "demons" are described as "unclean spirits" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-1.htm" title="And when he had called to him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.">Matthew 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-43.htm" title="When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none.">Matthew 12:43</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>) acting under a "ruler" or "prince," who is popularly known by the name of Beelzebub, the old Philistine deity of Ekron, and whom our Lord identifies with Satan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-24.htm" title="But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow does not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.">Matthew 12:24-26</a>). The Talmud swarms with allusions to such demons as lurking in the air, in food, in clothing, and working their evil will on the bodies or the souls of men. St. Paul, though he refers only once to "demons," in this sense, and then apparently as the authors of false doctrines claiming divine authority, but coming really from "seducing spirits" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm" title="Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;">1Timothy 4:1</a>), seems to see in some forms, at least, of bodily disease the permitted agency of Satan, as in the case of the chastisement inflicted on the incestuous Corinthian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="To deliver such an one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.">1Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-11.htm" title="Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.">2Corinthians 2:11</a>), his own "thorn in the flesh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2Corinthians 12:7</a>), and possibly in other like hindrances to his work (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm" title="Why we would have come to you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.">1Thessalonians 2:18</a>).<p>(3.) The belief bore its natural fruit among the Jews of our Lord's time. The work of the exorcist became a profession, as in the case of the sons of Sceva at Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-13.htm" title="Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took on them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.">Acts 19:13</a>). Charms and incantations were used, including the more sacred forms of the divine name. The Pharisees appear to have claimed the power as one of the privileges belonging to their superior holiness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-27.htm" title="And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.">Matthew 12:27</a>). Josephus narrates that a herb grew at Machaerus, the root of which had the power of expelling demons (whom he defines as the spirits of wicked men), and that he had himself beheld, in the presence of Vespasian, a man possessed with a demon, cured by a ring containing a root of like properties. As a proof of the reality of the dispossession, a vessel of water was placed at a little distance from the man, which was overthrown by the unseen demon as he passed out from the man's nostrils (<span class= "ital">Wars,</span> vii. 6, ? 3; <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> viii. 2, ? 5). The belief as to the demons being "the souls of the dead," lingered in the Christian Church, was accepted by Justin, who, coming from Samaria, probably received it from the Jews (<span class= "ital">Apol.</span> I., i., p. 65), and was recognised as at least a common belief by Chrysostom (<span class= "ital">De Lazaro,</span> I., p. 728).<p>(4.) Our Lord's treatment of the cases of men thus "possessed with demons" stands out partly as accepting the prevailing belief in its highest aspects, partly as contrasted with it. He uses no spells or charms, but does the work of casting out as by His own divine authority, "with a word." He delegates to the Twelve the power to "cast out demons," as well as to cure diseases (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-8.htm" title="Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely you have received, freely give.">Matthew 10:8</a>); and when the Seventy return with the report that the devils (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> demons) were subject unto them in His name, He speaks of that result as a victory over Satan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/10-17.htm" title="And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject to us through your name.">Luke 10:17-18</a>). He makes the action of the demons the vehicle for a parable, in which first one and then eight demons are represented as possessing the same man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-43.htm" title="When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none.">Matthew 12:43-45</a>). It may be noted that He nowhere speaks of them, in the language of the later current beliefs of Christendom, as identical with the "fallen angels," or as the souls of the dead, though they are evil spirits subject to the power of Satan.<p>(5.) It is obvious that many hard questions rise out of these facts. Does our Lord's indirect teaching stamp the popular belief with the seal of His authority? or did He, knowing it to be false, accommodate Himself to their belief, and speak in the only way men were able to understand of His own power to heal, teaching them as they were "able to hear it?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-33.htm" title="And with many such parables spoke he the word to them, as they were able to hear it.">Mark 4:33</a>). If we answer the former question in the affirmative, are we to believe that the fact of possession was peculiar to the time and country, and that the "demons" (either as the souls of the dead, or as evil angels) have since been restrained by the influence of Christendom or the power of Christ? or may we still trace their agency in the more obscure and startling phenomena of mental disease, in the <span class= "ital">delirium tremens</span> of the drunkard, in the orgiastic frenzy of some Eastern religions, in homicidal or suicidal mania? And if we go as far as this, is it a true theory of disease in general to assign it, in all cases, to the permitted agency of Satan? and how can we reconcile that belief either with the temper which receives sickness as "God's visitation," or with that which seeks out its mechanical or chemical causes? Wise and good men have answered these questions very differently, and it may be that we have not the <span class= "ital">data</span> for an absolutely certain and exhaustive answer. It is well to remember, on the one hand, that to speak of the phenomena of the Gospel possessions as mania, hysteria, or the like, is to give them a name, but not to assign a cause--that science, let it push its researches into mental disease ever so far, has to confess at last that it stands in the presence of unknown forces, more amenable often to spiritual influences than to any medical treatment; and on the other, that our Lord came to rescue men from the thraldom of frenzy and disease, and so to prepare them for the higher work of spiritual renovation, rather than rudely to sweep away the traditional belief of the people as to their source, or to proclaim a new psychological theory.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28-34.</span> <span class="accented">- The Gadarene demoniacs.</span> Parallel passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-1.htm">Mark 5:1-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-26.htm">Luke 8:26-39</a>, where see full notes. Matthew is much less detailed. Matthew mentions two demoniacs; the parallel passages, one; the reason may be either that one was less fierce than the other, or that only one came from Gerasa (Nosgen). But in our present knowledge of the extent of inspiration, we cannot confidently affirm that the evangelists were kept from errors in numbers, and that the addition of the second demoniac is not due' to some misunderstanding, perhaps of the use of the plural in the demoniac's answer in the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-9.htm">Mark 5:9</a> (cf. Weiss, 'Marcus-ev.,' p. 172). (For a similar difficulty, cf. the note on Matthew 9:27-31.) With regard to this mysterious narrative generally, the explanation of its details can be little more than empirical in our present knowledge of psychology and of spiritual influences. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he was come to the other side into the country of the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Gergesenes;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">Gadarenes</span>, which is certainly right here, as is "Gerasenes" in the parallel passages (cf. Westcott and Hort, it. 'App.'). Gergesa (Textus Receptus here, and Alexandrian authorities in parallel passages) and Gerasa (unless, with Origen on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-28.htm">John 1:28</a>, we understand by this the Arabian Gerasa fifty miles away)are probably forms of the same name now represented by <span class="accented">Khersa</span>, a village discovered (? in 1857) by Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' pp. 375, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>, edit. 1880) on the eastern side of the lake, and lying "within a few rods of the shore," with "an immense mountain" rising directly above it, "in which are ancient tombs, out of some of which the two men possessed of the devils may have issued to meet Jesus. The lake is so near the base of the mountain that the swine, rushing madly down it, could not stop, but would be hurried on into the water and drowned." To this Origen's description (<span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>) corresponds: "Gergesa, to which the Gergesenes belong, is an ancient city by what is now called the Lake of Tiberias, by which is a steep place adjacent to the lake, and down this, as is pointed out, the swine were cast headlong by the demons." Gadara, in some sense the capital of Peraea (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 4:07. 3), and one of the towns of the Decapolis confederacy (ch. 4:25), was some twelve miles distant from <span class="accented">Khersa</span>, and six miles from the nearest part of the lake, to which, in fact (as the stamp of a ship on its coins shows), its territory extended (cf. Schiirer, II. 1. p. 100, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>). St. Matthew describes the locality, not by the little-known village, but by the well-known city of the district, to which (as we may gather from the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-20.htm">Mark 5:20</a>) the news of the miracle afterwards spread. But since he leaves the expression, "the city," in vers. 33, 34 as he fontal it in his sources, <span class="accented">i.e. Khersa</span>, the result is at first misleading <span class="cmt_word">There met him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>; <span class="accented">occurrerunt</span>, Vulgate). St. Matthew (contrast vers. 2, 5, 19) omits the nearer approach recorded in the parallel passages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-6.htm">Mark 5:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-28.htm">Luke 8:28</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Two</span> (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Possessed with devils</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a>, note), <span class="cmt_word">coming out of the tombs;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">coming forth out.</span> The Greek shows that they did not merely come from among the tombs, but actually out of them (cf. the experience of Warburton, as quoted in Trench on this miracle). E<span class="cmt_word">xceeding fierce, so that no man might</span> (Revised Version, could) <span class="cmt_word">pass</span> <span class="cmt_word">by that way</span>. Matthew only. It deepens the contrast to their present behaviour. Perhaps "that way" refers to the Roman road by the side of the lake (cf. Thomson, <span class="accented">op. cit.</span>, p. 378). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:28-34 The devils have nothing to do with Christ as a Saviour; they neither have, nor hope for any benefit from him. Oh the depth of this mystery of Divine love; that fallen man has so much to do with Christ, when fallen angels have nothing to do with him! Heb 2:16. Surely here was torment, to be forced to own the excellence that is in Christ, and yet they had no part in him. The devils desire not to have any thing to do with Christ as a Ruler. See whose language those speak, who will have nothing to do with the gospel of Christ. But it is not true that the devils have nothing to do with Christ as a Judge; for they have, and they know it, and thus it is with all the children of men. Satan and his instruments can go no further than he permits; they must quit possession when he commands. They cannot break his hedge of protection about his people; they cannot enter even a swine without his leave. They had leave. God often, for wise and holy ends, permits the efforts of Satan's rage. Thus the devil hurries people to sin; hurries them to what they have resolved against, which they know will be shame and grief to them: miserable is the condition of those who are led captive by him at his will. There are a great many who prefer their swine before the Saviour, and so come short of Christ and salvation by him. They desire Christ to depart out of their hearts, and will not suffer his word to have place in them, because he and his word would destroy their brutish lusts, those swine which they give themselves up to feed. And justly will Christ forsake all that are weary of him; and say hereafter, Depart, ye cursed, to those who now say to the Almighty, Depart from us.</body></html>
