Nothing in the Gospel history, however, suggests this. Philip had been called before, and had obeyed the call (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-43.htm" title="The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and finds Philip, and said to him, Follow me.">John 1:43</a>). All that we can say is that it may have been so, and that he may at this stage of his spiritual growth have shrunk from the fresh activity of actual service in the work of evangelising. The form of the petition may mean either (1) that his father was then actually dead, and that the disciple asked leave to remain and pay the last honours to his remains, or (2) that he asked to remain with his father till his death. The latter seems by far the most probable. In the East burial followed so immediately on death that the former would hardly have involved more than the delay of a few hours. In the latter case the request was, in fact, a plea for indefinite postponement. This at least fits in best with the apparent severity of our Lord's answer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And another of his</span> (Revised Version, <span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>disciples said unto him</span>. <span class="accented">Disciples</span> in the wider sense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-1.htm">Matthew 5:1</a>, note),whether the twelve had or had not been chosen. In the latter case, the man may have been Thomas (Trench, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>), but hardly Philip (Clem. Alex.) after <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-43.htm">John 1:43</a>. Yet it is precarious to see in him the despondency of Thomas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-6.htm">John 11:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-24.htm">John 20:24, 25</a>) merely because his father is dead, and he has scruples about immediately following Christ. Lord, suffer me first. The man's words imply a consciousness of a call. His heart told him that he ought to go, but he asks for a delay, and, in fact, a real difficulty seems to hinder him from going. St. Luke places the Lord's "Follow me" before the man's request; but here, as in textual criticism, <span class="accented">proclivi scriptioni praestat ardua.</span> To go and bury my father. Then lying dead. Of all filial duties perhaps the <span class="accented">most</span> bind-ins (cf. Tobit 4:3 Tobit 14:10, 11). Observe <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the burial would take place much sooner than is usual with us, and would seldom be more than twenty-four hours after death; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that, however, according to Jewish law, the ceremonial observances connected with the burial and consequent purifications would have taken many days (Edersheim, 'Life,' 2:133). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:18-22 One of the scribes was too hasty in promising; he proffers himself to be a close follower of Christ. He seems to be very resolute. Many resolutions for religion are produced by sudden conviction, and taken up without due consideration; these come to nothing. When this scribe offered to follow Christ, one would think he should have been encouraged; one scribe might do more credit and service than twelve fishermen; but Christ saw his heart, and answered to its thoughts, and therein teaches all how to come to Christ. His resolve seems to have been from a worldly, covetous principle; but Christ had not a place to lay his head on, and if he follows him, he must not expect to fare better than he fared. We have reason to think this scribe went away. Another was too slow. Delay in doing is as bad on the one hand, as hastiness in resolving is on the other. He asked leave to attend his father to his grave, and then he would be at Christ's service. This seemed reasonable, yet it was not right. He had not true zeal for the work. Burying the dead, especially a dead father, is a good work, but it is not thy work at this time. If Christ requires our service, affection even for the nearest and dearest relatives, and for things otherwise our duty, must give way. An unwilling mind never wants an excuse. Jesus said to him, Follow me; and, no doubt, power went with this word to him as to others; he did follow Christ, and cleaved to him. The scribe said, I will follow thee; to this man Christ said, Follow me; comparing them together, it shows that we are brought to Christ by the force of his call to us, Ro 9:16.</body></html>
