There were two reasons why the time should be thus specified. (1) It was natural that the sick should be brought in the cool of the evening, rather than in the scorching heat of the afternoon; and (2) it was the Sabbath, and the feeling which made the Pharisees question the lawfulness of a man's carrying the bed on which he had been lying (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-10.htm" title="The Jews therefore said to him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.">John 5:10</a>), would probably have deterred the friends of the sick from bringing them as long as it lasted. But with sunset the Sabbath came to a close, and then they would feel themselves free to act. The prominence given to "those that were possessed with devils," both by St. Matthew and St. Mark, shows that it was the work of the Sabbath morning that had most impressed itself on their minds.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">great number of his miracles</span>, <span class="accented">and the secret of his performing them.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - Parallel passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-32.htm">Mark 1:32-34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-40.htm">Luke 4:40</a>. <span class="cmt_word">When the even</span> <span class="cmt_word">was come;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">and when even-</span>According to the original connexion, preserved, as it seems, in Mark and Luke, this was the evening of the day in which our Lord had healed the man with the withered hand in the synagogue.

But with the setting sun (parallel passage in Luke), or rather, according to Talmudic teaching, when three stars were visible after sunset (<span class="accented">vide</span> Lightfoot, ' Her. Hebr.,' <span class="accented">in lee.</span>), the sabbath was over (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-32.htm">Leviticus 23:32</a>), and people were free to carry out their sick.

The church of Rome, which forbids ministers to marry, goes contrary to that apostle upon whom they rest so much. He had his wife's mother with him in his family, which is an example to be kind to our relations. In spiritual healing, the Scripture speaks the word, the Spirit gives the touch, touches the heart, touches the hand. Those who recover from fevers, commonly are weak and feeble some time after; but to show that this cure was above the power of nature, the woman was at once so well as to go about the business of the house. The miracles which Jesus did being noised abroad, many thronged to him. He healed all that were sick, though the patient was ever so mean, and the case ever so bad. Many are the diseases and calamities to which we are liable in the body; and there is more, in those words of the gospel, that Jesus Christ bore our sicknesses and carried our sorrows, to support and comfort us under them, than in all the writings of the philosophers. Let us not grudge labour, trouble, or expense in doing good to others.</body></html>
