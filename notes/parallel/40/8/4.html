The reasons of the command are not given, but are not far to seek. (1.) The offering of the gift was an act of obedience to the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-10.htm" title="And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.">Leviticus 14:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/14-21.htm" title="And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil;">Leviticus 14:21-22</a>), and was therefore the right thing for the man to do. In this way also our Lord showed that He had not come to destroy the Law, but to fulfil. (2.) It was the appointed test of the reality and completeness of the cleansing work. (3.) It was better for the man's own spiritual life to cherish his gratitude than to waste it in many words.<p>So much lies on the surface. But as the treatment of leprosy in the Mosaic code was clearly symbolical rather than sanitary, and dealt with the disease as the special type of sin in its most malignant form, so in the healing of the leper we may fairly see the symbol of our Lord's power to purify and save from sin, and in His touching the leper, the close fellowship into which He entered with our unclean nature, that through His touch it might be made clean. The miracle, like most other miracles, was also a parable in act.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of those who were not present (Bengel).

The Lord did not desire to be thronged with multitudes who came only to see his miracles; he would work in quiet (cf. the quotation from Isaiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-18.htm">Matthew 12:18-21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But go thy way, show thyself to the priest.</span> The latter clause belongs verbally to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-49.htm">Leviticus 13:49</a>, but the thought is that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-2.htm">Leviticus 14:2</a>, <span class="accented">sqq.</span> Without the official verdict, the man could not be restored to communal privileges (so also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-14.htm">Luke 17:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And offer the gift that Moses commanded</span>. Including <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "two living clean birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-4.htm">Leviticus 14:4</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "two he-lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth parts <span class="accented">of an epbah</span> of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-10.htm">Leviticus 14:10</a>), unless he he poor, in which case lesser sacrifices may be substituted (vers. 21, 22; cf. Keil, 'Arch.,' &sect; 59; and for details of the traditional ceremonial, Edersheim, 'Temple,' pp. 315-318). <span class="cmt_word">For a testimony unto them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). Although a fair sense might be extracted by connecting this clause with. the words, "Moses commanded," it would, especially in the parallel passages, be a very awkward addition to them. Rather it must represent the man's "offering" in its ultimate purpose, and this not necessarily in the man's own mind. So more clearly the "Western" reading in the parallel passage in Luke, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. Whether "them" refers to the priests or to the nation generally is not of grave importance, for the priests themselves, in act and feeling, represented the nation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-29.htm">Matthew 7:29</a>, note). Of more interest is the question - What is that which is here testified of? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">Prima facie</span> the man's own state. The performance of the rites would be legal evidence that he was clean. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Yet this interpretation is hardly borne out by the usage of the phrase. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in the LXX. (never closely with the dative as here) seems to always refer to that which is both permanent and important (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-30.htm">Genesis 21:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-44.htm">Genesis 31:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-26.htm">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-27.htm">Joshua 24:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-12.htm">Hosea 2:12</a>). And in the New Testament with the dative it elsewhere refers either to work for the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-18.htm">Matthew 10:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-11.htm">Mark 6:11</a>) or to a solemn judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-3.htm">James 5:3</a>). So probably here. The man's offering is to be a permanent testimony to the nation of our Lord's relation to the Law. His miracles confirmed his profession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Some, however, accepting the above view in the main, translate, "for a testimony against them" (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-11.htm">Mark 6:11</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-5.htm">Luke 9:5</a>, and as perhaps <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-3.htm">James 5:3</a>, but <span class="accented">vide</span> Plumptre there); but it is unlikely that so harsh a thought towards the nation would be expressed by our Lord at this early stage of his ministry. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-11.htm">Mark 6:11</a> there is a definite reason for its use. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:2-4 In these verses we have an account of Christ's cleansing a leper, who came and worshipped him, as one clothed with Divine power. This cleansing directs us, not only to apply to Christ, who has power over bodily diseases, for the cure of them, but it also teaches us in what manner to apply to him. When we cannot be sure of God's will, we may be sure of his wisdom and mercy. No guilt is so great, but there is that in Christ's blood which atones for it; no corruption so strong, but there is that in his grace which can subdue it. To be made clean we must commend ourselves to his pity; we cannot demand it as a debt, but we must humbly request it as a favour. Those who by faith apply to Christ for mercy and grace, may be sure that he is freely willing to give them the mercy and grace they thus seek. And those afflictions are blessed that bring us to know Christ, and cause us to seek help and salvation from him. Let those who are cleansed from their spiritual leprosy, go to Christ's ministers and open their case, that they may advise, comfort, and pray for them.</body></html>
