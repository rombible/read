Either he did not know of them, and then we must infer the entire independence of his record, or knowing them, he, writing for Gentiles, thought it best to omit words here which our Lord had afterwards repeated, and which he had therefore another opportunity of recording (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-28.htm" title="There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.">Luke 13:28</a>). Such verbal reproduction of what had been said before was, it will be remembered, entirely after our Lord's manner.<p><span class= "bld">Many shall come from the east and west.</span>--It is clear that our Lord saw in the centurion the first-fruits of the wide harvest of the future. Like the words of the Baptist in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-9.htm" title="And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.">Matthew 3:9</a>, what He now said contained, by implication, the whole gospel which St. Paul preached to the Gentiles. "East and west," even without the formal addition of "north and south," which we find in the parallel passage of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-29.htm" title="And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.">Luke 13:29</a>, were used as limits that included all the nations of the earth.<p><span class= "bld">Shall sit down.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">shall recline,</span> as at the table of a feast; that being, as in the phrase of Abraham's bosom, the received parable of the blessedness of the kingdom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - In Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-28.htm">Luke 13:28, 29</a>) not joined to this miracle, but placed after the warning about mere professors (our <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-23.htm">Matthew 7:23</a>). Also they are there given in the reverse order. Taking the other facts (ver. 5, note) about this miracle into consideration, there can be little doubt but that St. Matthew does not place these verses in their historical connexion. He wishes to emphasize the teaching of the miracle, that Gentiles accept Christ, though Jews reject him. For this reason also he gives the two verses in the reverse order. <span class="cmt_word">And</span>.

The image, taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>, is exceedingly common in Jewish Haggadic (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> mostly parabolic) teaching (cf.

An early" Western" reading is, "in the bosom of Abraham," etc. (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-23.htm">Luke 16:23</a>).

"Rather than of the king; since many are in the kingdom, whom notwithstanding the king rejects as traitors; whereas all the children of the king are adopted as co-heirs with his only begotten Son" (Beza, in Ford). This interpretation is attractive, but doubtless false. The Hebrew idiom enables the writer to suggest the idea of the Jews, who are by nature heirs of the Divine kingdom, being notwithstanding excluded (cf <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall be cast out</span> (Revised Version, <span class="accented">forth</span>); <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-4.htm">Matthew 7:4</a>, note).

The article, which should strictly be repeated before <span class="accented">gnashing</span>, points to a recognized conception. The phrase occurs (except in the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-28.htm">Luke 13:28</a>) only in St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-42.htm">Matthew 13:42, 50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-13.htm">Matthew 22:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-51.htm">Matthew 24:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-30.htm">Matthew 25:30</a>), in each case contrasting the place into which the wicked are sent with that which they might have enjoyed. Observe the description of "hell" - absence of spiritual light; separation from the company of the saved; lamentation; impotent rage. The second couplet corresponds to the first. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:5-13 This centurion was a heathen, a Roman soldier. Though he was a soldier, yet he was a godly man. No man's calling or place will be an excuse for unbelief and sin. See how he states his servant's case. We should concern ourselves for the souls of our children and servants, who are spiritually sick, who feel not spiritual evils, who know not that which is spiritually good; and we should bring them to Christ by faith and prayers. Observe his self-abasement. Humble souls are made more humble by Christ's gracious dealings with them. Observe his great faith. The more diffident we are of ourselves, the stronger will be our confidence in Christ. Herein the centurion owns him to have Divine power, and a full command of all the creatures and powers of nature, as a master over his servants. Such servants we all should be to God; we must go and come, according to the directions of his word and the disposals of his providence. But when the Son of man comes he finds little faith, therefore he finds little fruit. An outward profession may cause us to be called children of the kingdom; but if we rest in that, and have nothing else to show, we shall be cast out. The servant got a cure of his disease, and the master got the approval of his faith. What was said to him, is said to all, Believe, and ye shall receive; only believe. See the power of Christ, and the power of faith. The healing of our souls is at once the effect and evidence of our interest in the blood of Christ.</body></html>
