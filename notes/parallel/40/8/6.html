The former meaning is the more common, and is fixed as the meaning here by St. Luke's use of the word which means strictly "slave." He is described as paralysed, but the words "grievously tormented" point to more acute suffering than is common in that form of disease, and imply either something like rheumatic fever, or tetanus, or the special kind of paralysis which benumbs the muscles only, and affects the nerves of sensation with sharp pain. A like case of paralysis with agonising pain is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/9-55.htm" title="And as he began to pull down, even at that time was Alcimus plagued, and his enterprises hindered: for his mouth was stopped, and he was taken with a palsy, so that he could no more speak any thing, nor give order concerning his house.">1 Maccabees 9:55-56</a>. The fact that this suffering touched his master's heart with pity was itself a sign of something exceptionally good in the centurion's character. It was not thus, for the most part, that the wealthy Romans dealt with their slaves when they were sick. St. Luke does not state the nature of the disease, perhaps as not having been able to satisfy himself as to its precise nature, but simply describes the slave as "ill, and at the point to die," and adds that he was "dear" (literally, <span class= "ital">precious</span>) to his master. His narrative states further that the centurion sent the elders, "having heard of Jesus." The report had obviously been such as to lead him to look on the Teacher as endowed with a supernatural power. It may have come from the elders of the synagogue themselves; but the facts of the case make it probable that he had heard specifically of the healing of the "nobleman's son" at Capernaum recorded by St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/4-46.htm" title="So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.">John 4:46-54</a>). There he had found a precedent which now determined his own line of action, showing that a word from those lips might be enough to heal without touch or even presence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - Matthew only. <span class="cmt_word">And saying, Lord, my servant</span>; Revised Version margin, "boy" (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), just as in some English-speaking communities "boy" is commonly used for "manservant." In the parallel passage of Luke, the narrative speaks of him as <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the message as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Lieth</span>. Perforce (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">At home</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">in the house</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the centurion. <span class="cmt_word">Sick of the palsy, grievously tormented</span> (cf. 1 Macc. 9:55, 56). "Paralysis with contraction of the joints is accompanied with intense suffering, and, when united, as it much oftener is in the hot climates of the East and of Africa than among us, with tetanus, both '<span class="accented">grievously torments</span>,' and rapidly brings on dissolution" (Trench, 'Miracles,' p231: 1866). Observe that the statement of the case is itself a petition. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:5-13 This centurion was a heathen, a Roman soldier. Though he was a soldier, yet he was a godly man. No man's calling or place will be an excuse for unbelief and sin. See how he states his servant's case. We should concern ourselves for the souls of our children and servants, who are spiritually sick, who feel not spiritual evils, who know not that which is spiritually good; and we should bring them to Christ by faith and prayers. Observe his self-abasement. Humble souls are made more humble by Christ's gracious dealings with them. Observe his great faith. The more diffident we are of ourselves, the stronger will be our confidence in Christ. Herein the centurion owns him to have Divine power, and a full command of all the creatures and powers of nature, as a master over his servants. Such servants we all should be to God; we must go and come, according to the directions of his word and the disposals of his providence. But when the Son of man comes he finds little faith, therefore he finds little fruit. An outward profession may cause us to be called children of the kingdom; but if we rest in that, and have nothing else to show, we shall be cast out. The servant got a cure of his disease, and the master got the approval of his faith. What was said to him, is said to all, Believe, and ye shall receive; only believe. See the power of Christ, and the power of faith. The healing of our souls is at once the effect and evidence of our interest in the blood of Christ.</body></html>
