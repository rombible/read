Here was one who believed in the power of the word of the Christ, and asked for nothing more.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When</span> (Revised Version, <span class="accented">add when</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Jesus heard it, he marvelled</span>. Contrast "and he marvelled because of their unbelief" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-6.htm">Mark 6:6</a>). We read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24, 25</a>, "But Jesus did not trust himself unto them, for that he knew all men, and because he needed not that any one should bear witness concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man." Yet here our Lord marvels at the character of the centurion. How can we reconcile these two statements? As yet not fully, for the question takes us to the centre of our Lord's personality. But we must remember: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That Augustine's solution - Christ did not so much actually wonder, as commend to us that which was worthy of our admiration - "brings an unreality into parts of our Lord's conduct, as though he did some things for show and the effect which they would have on others, instead of all his actions having their deepest root in his own nature, being the truthful exponents of his own inmost being" (Trench). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That St. John was referring, as it seems, to persons with whom our Lord was brought into contact, while here the centurion is probably absent (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). Our Lord's powers of perception (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, John) have here had no opportunity of action. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That, in any case, even our Lord's mental powers did not act in any unnatural method. In his grasping the true character of each man's mind, the same processes (however rapid in his case) must have taken place as take place in men generally, and among these processes is wonder at some fresh trait. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> That unless we are prepared to accept a subtle Apollinarianism, we must suppose that Christ came to know human hearts by his human rather than by his Divine powers. This, of course, will not exclude his receiving special communications in the Holy Spirit, by whose agency we may suppose that he "<span class="accented">saw</span> Nathanael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-48.htm">John 1:48</a>). <span class="cmt_word">and said to them that followed</span>. The multitudes (ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</span> So also the Revised Version (similarly Luke), but Revised Version margin and Westcott and Hort read, With no man in Israel have I found so great faith," in which there is more distinct reference to the individuals whom he had actually met. A Gentile surpassed them all. Notice that the centurion is put above the apostles; and rightly, especially if even Peter had not as yet thought of the cure of his mother-in-law (ver. 14, note). Yet the centurion was not called to apostleship. <span class="accented">Found.</span> "Quae-rens, cum veni" (Bengel). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:5-13 This centurion was a heathen, a Roman soldier. Though he was a soldier, yet he was a godly man. No man's calling or place will be an excuse for unbelief and sin. See how he states his servant's case. We should concern ourselves for the souls of our children and servants, who are spiritually sick, who feel not spiritual evils, who know not that which is spiritually good; and we should bring them to Christ by faith and prayers. Observe his self-abasement. Humble souls are made more humble by Christ's gracious dealings with them. Observe his great faith. The more diffident we are of ourselves, the stronger will be our confidence in Christ. Herein the centurion owns him to have Divine power, and a full command of all the creatures and powers of nature, as a master over his servants. Such servants we all should be to God; we must go and come, according to the directions of his word and the disposals of his providence. But when the Son of man comes he finds little faith, therefore he finds little fruit. An outward profession may cause us to be called children of the kingdom; but if we rest in that, and have nothing else to show, we shall be cast out. The servant got a cure of his disease, and the master got the approval of his faith. What was said to him, is said to all, Believe, and ye shall receive; only believe. See the power of Christ, and the power of faith. The healing of our souls is at once the effect and evidence of our interest in the blood of Christ.</body></html>
