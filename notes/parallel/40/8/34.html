St. Mark and St. Luke add, that they found the demoniac "clothed, and in his right mind, sitting at the feet of Jesus," in the clinging gratitude of faith. The narrative half suggests the thought that the garment which he now wore as the outward sign of a new self-reverence had been supplied by the pity of the disciples.<p><span class= "bld">Besought him that he would depart.</span>--It was characteristic of the wild, half-heathen population that they were led to look on the Prophet who had wrought so great a work as a Destroyer rather than a Saviour, and therefore shrank from His presence among them. Not so with the demoniac himself. He felt, with a faith which was real, though weak, as if he were only safe while close to his Deliverer. He followed Him to the boat, and as He was in the act of embarking (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-18.htm" title="And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.">Mark 5:18</a>), prayed that he might be with Him. But this was not the discipline which was needed for his spiritual health. Retirement, renewed fellowship with his kindred in his own house, the quiet witness borne there that the Lord had had compassion on him--this was better for him than the work of a more avowed discipleship. And so he went his way "proclaiming," or "preaching," what Jesus had done for him--a true evangelist to a people whose panic terror showed that they were as yet in darkness and the shadow of death.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold</span>.

The true reading, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-1.htm">Matthew 25:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-13.htm">John 12:13</a>), would seem to suggest the closest proximity (cf. Bishop Lightfoot on <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a>), while <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-6.htm">Matthew 25:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-15.htm">Acts 28:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>) connotes a, contrast to the place left. <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, again (Textus Receptus here, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-13.htm">John 12:13</a>, D, <span class="accented">el.</span>), emphasizes the thought of companionship. <span class="cmt_word">And when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts</span>; <span class="accented">from their borders</span> (Revised Version). These Gerasenes, vexed at the loss of wealth, felt, like the demoniacs, that there was nothing in common between themselves and Jesus, but, unlike them, showed no consciousness of sin. Without this he could do nothing for them, so he granted their request (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-1.htm">Matthew 9:1</a>). St. Peter also once bade Jesus depart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-8.htm">Luke 5:8</a>), but his reason, "for I am a sinful man, O Lord," showed a heartfelt desire after the deepest union with him. With the ungranted request of the man to remain with Jesus, and his subsequent preaching to these Gerasenes and others (parallel passages), St. Matthew does not concern himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:28-34 The devils have nothing to do with Christ as a Saviour; they neither have, nor hope for any benefit from him. Oh the depth of this mystery of Divine love; that fallen man has so much to do with Christ, when fallen angels have nothing to do with him! Heb 2:16. Surely here was torment, to be forced to own the excellence that is in Christ, and yet they had no part in him. The devils desire not to have any thing to do with Christ as a Ruler. See whose language those speak, who will have nothing to do with the gospel of Christ. But it is not true that the devils have nothing to do with Christ as a Judge; for they have, and they know it, and thus it is with all the children of men. Satan and his instruments can go no further than he permits; they must quit possession when he commands. They cannot break his hedge of protection about his people; they cannot enter even a swine without his leave. They had leave. God often, for wise and holy ends, permits the efforts of Satan's rage. Thus the devil hurries people to sin; hurries them to what they have resolved against, which they know will be shame and grief to them: miserable is the condition of those who are led captive by him at his will. There are a great many who prefer their swine before the Saviour, and so come short of Christ and salvation by him. They desire Christ to depart out of their hearts, and will not suffer his word to have place in them, because he and his word would destroy their brutish lusts, those swine which they give themselves up to feed. And justly will Christ forsake all that are weary of him; and say hereafter, Depart, ye cursed, to those who now say to the Almighty, Depart from us.</body></html>
