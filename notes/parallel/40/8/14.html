And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they sought him for her.">Luke 4:38</a>) relate more specifically that it was on the Sabbath, and that our Lord had previously taught in the synagogue and healed a demoniac. The sons of Zebedee and of Jona had all been present, and when the service was over they came to the house in which Peter apparently (though born in Bethsaida, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-44.htm" title="Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.">John 1:44</a>) had settled on his marriage.<p><span class= "bld">His wife's mother.</span>--The fact of St. Peter's marriage has not unnaturally been almost unduly prominent in the Protestant argument against the enforced celibacy of the clergy. "Here," it has been said, "is the Apostle from whom the Bishop of Rome claims succession, married when called to his office, and never separated from his wife, and yet Rome declares the marriage of priests to be unlawful, and stigmatises it as worse than concubinage." Telling as it may sound, however, it is after all only an <span class= "ital">argumentum ad hominem.</span> Had the case been otherwise, we should not have admitted that the celibacy of the chief of the Apostles was a ground for compelling all bishops, elders, and deacons of the Church to follow his example. And all that can be urged, as the case stands, is that there is an inconsistency in accepting these facts, and yet treating marriage as <span class= "ital">incompatible</span> with the sacred office of the ministry. The Church of Rome might answer, that experience, or the teaching of the Spirit, or the moral authority of the saints and Fathers of the Church, outweighed the inference from St. Peter's example, and the question must be discussed on wider ethical and social, as well as Scriptural, grounds. In that argument, it is believed, those who advocate Christian liberty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-5.htm" title="Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?">1Corinthians 9:5</a>) as most in harmony with the mind of Christ are not likely to get the worst of it.<p><span class= "bld">Sick of a fever.</span>--St. Luke, with a kind of medical precision, adds, "with a great fever," and that they (Peter, John, and the others) asked Him about her, as if consulting about a case of which they almost despaired.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - The <span class="accented">healing of St. Peter's wife's mother.</span> Parallel passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-29.htm">Mark 1:29-31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-38.htm">Luke 4:38, 39</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when Jesus was come into</span> <span class="cmt_word">Peter's house.</span> Straight from the synagogue (parallel passages), for food, ver. 15 (Chrysostom). It seems clear, from the parallel passages, that St. Peter had not previously told our Lord about his mother-in-law's illness, but that he, with others, now asked (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, Luke) him to heal her. Among these others were probably Andrew, who also lived in the house, and James and John, who accompanied our Lord (Mark). Whether or not it was Peter's own house, we have no means of telling (but see next verse). <span class="cmt_word">He saw</span>. Presumably on entering, before they asked him about her. <span class="cmt_word">His wife's mother</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>). As St. Peter lived for some forty years more, he can hardly have been now very long married (cf. Bengel). <span class="cmt_word">Laid</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>); ver. 6. <span class="cmt_word">And sick of a fever</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:14-17 Peter had a wife, yet was an apostle of Christ, who showed that he approved of the married state, by being thus kind to Peter's wife's relations. The church of Rome, which forbids ministers to marry, goes contrary to that apostle upon whom they rest so much. He had his wife's mother with him in his family, which is an example to be kind to our relations. In spiritual healing, the Scripture speaks the word, the Spirit gives the touch, touches the heart, touches the hand. Those who recover from fevers, commonly are weak and feeble some time after; but to show that this cure was above the power of nature, the woman was at once so well as to go about the business of the house. The miracles which Jesus did being noised abroad, many thronged to him. He healed all that were sick, though the patient was ever so mean, and the case ever so bad. Many are the diseases and calamities to which we are liable in the body; and there is more, in those words of the gospel, that Jesus Christ bore our sicknesses and carried our sorrows, to support and comfort us under them, than in all the writings of the philosophers. Let us not grudge labour, trouble, or expense in doing good to others.</body></html>
