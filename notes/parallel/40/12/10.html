The casuistry of the Rabbis allowed the healing art to be practised on the Sabbath in cases of life and death, but the "withered hand," a permanent infirmity, obviously did not come under that category.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered;</span> <span class="accented">and behold a man having a withered hand</span> (Revised Version, with Westcott and Hort). For the quotation by Jerome from "the Gospel which the Nazarenes and Ebionites use" (comp. also Introduction, p. 16.), in which this man tells our Lord, "Coementarius (a mason) eram, manibus vietum quaeritans," see especially Resch, 'Agrapha,' p. 379. <span class="cmt_word">And they asked him, saying</span>. In the narrative of healing the man with the dropsy, found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-1.htm">Luke 14:1-6</a> (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>), a similar question is asked by our Lord. <span class="cmt_word">Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days?</span> The Tahnudic answer is that it is unlawful except in cases of actual danger to life (cf. Schurer, IL 2:104). but whether this distinction was really drawn as early as the time of our Lord {s not known in the present backward state of all critical investigations of Jewish literature. <span class="cmt_word">That they might accuse him;</span> <span class="accented">i.e. </span>before the local court, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21</a> (Meyer). Observe that, recognizing his readiness to help others, they desire (according to Matthew) to get a clear statement from him whether he would follow the traditional law (as we may assume it was) or net, intending to base their accusation on his reply. Verbally, however, Christ avoids the dilemma, as in the more famous case of the tribute to Caesar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-21.htm">Matthew 22:21</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:9-13 Christ shows that works of mercy are lawful and proper to be done on the Lord's day. There are more ways of doing well upon sabbath days, than by the duties of worship: attending the sick, relieving the poor, helping those who need speedy relief, teaching the young to care for their souls; these are doing good: and these must be done from love and charity, with humility and self-denial, and shall be accepted, Ge 4:7. This, like other cures which Christ wrought, had a spiritual meaning. By nature our hands are withered, and we are unable of ourselves to do any thing that is good. Christ only, by the power of his grace, cures us; he heals the withered hand by putting life into the dead soul, works in us both to will and to do: for, with the command, there is a promise of grace given by the word.</body></html>
