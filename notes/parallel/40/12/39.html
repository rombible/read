One sign and only one, such as they demanded, should be given to those for whom the other notes of Messiahship were insufficient, and that should be the sign of the prophet Jonas.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - Of the passages mentioned in the introductory note on vers. 38-42, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-4.htm">Matthew 16:4</a> is verbally identical with the answer of our present verse, except the omission of the words, "the prophet," which occur nowhere else but in this passage. <span class="cmt_word">But he answered and said to them, An evil</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>, ch. 6:13, note) <span class="cmt_word">and adulterous generation</span>. However frequent the sin of adultery may then have been, the common metaphorical sense of spiritual unfaithfulness to God and the practical worship of some other than Jehovah seems the more probable here (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20-23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Seeketh after</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-32.htm">Matthew 6:32</a>. <span class="cmt_word">A sign; but there shall no sign be given to it</span>.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-4.htm">Matthew 16:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-29.htm">Luke 11:29</a> "the prophet" has been added in the Received Text. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:38-45 Though Christ is always ready to hear and answer holy desires and prayers, yet those who ask amiss, ask and have not. Signs were granted to those who desired them to confirm their faith, as Abraham and Gideon; but denied to those who demanded them to excuse their unbelief. The resurrection of Christ from the dead by his own power, called here the sign of the prophet Jonah, was the great proof of Christ's being the Messiah. As Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale, and then came out again alive, thus Christ would be so long in the grave, and then rise again. The Ninevites would shame the Jews for not repenting; the queen of Sheba, for not believing in Christ. And we have no such cares to hinder us, we come not to Christ upon such uncertainties. This parable represents the case of the Jewish church and nation. It is also applicable to all those who hear the word of God, and are in part reformed, but not truly converted. The unclean spirit leaves for a time, but when he returns, he finds Christ is not there to shut him out; the heart is swept by outward reformation, but garnished by preparation to comply with evil suggestions, and the man becomes a more decided enemy of the truth. Every heart is the residence of unclean spirits, except those which are temples of the Holy Ghost, by faith in Christ.</body></html>
