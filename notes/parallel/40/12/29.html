The "house" is the region which is subject to him--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> either the world at large, or the spirits of individual men; the "goods" or "instruments<span class= "ital">"</span> (comp. the "armour" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-22.htm" title="But when a stronger than he shall come on him, and overcome him, he takes from him all his armor wherein he trusted, and divides his spoils.">Luke 11:22</a>) are the demons or subordinate powers of evil by which he maintains his dominion; the "binding of the strong man" is the check given to the tyranny of Satan by emancipating the possessed sufferers from their thraldom; the "spoiling of the house" implies the final victory over him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - Parallel passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-27.htm">Mark 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-21.htm">Luke 11:21, 22</a>. Mark is practically identical with Matthew. Luke ("the strong man armed," etc.) is more detailed and vivid, and is perhaps the original form of the saying. <span class="cmt_word">Or</span> <span class="cmt_word">else</span>; <span class="accented">or</span> (Revised Version); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> if this be not the case, that the kingdom of God is come upon you, how else do you explain what has happened, the fact of Satan's instruments being taken from him? <span class="cmt_word">How can one enter into a strong man's house;</span> <span class="accented">the house of the strong man</span> (Revised Version).

It is an emphatic statement that he will do this, yes, utterly plunder (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) the whole house. The interpretation of the parable is self-evident: the strong man is Satan; his vessels are those afflicted by him; the one who binds, etc., is Christ. For Christ's appearance and work, even before the Crucifixion and Resurrection, bound Satan in this respect. Observe that there is probably a tacit reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-25.htm">Isaiah 49:25</a>, which at any rate now received a fulfilment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:22-30 A soul under Satan's power, and led captive by him, is blind in the things of God, and dumb at the throne of grace; sees nothing, and says nothing to the purpose. Satan blinds the eyes by unbelief, and seals up the lips from prayer. The more people magnified Christ, the more desirous the Pharisees were to vilify him. It was evident that if Satan aided Jesus in casting out devils, the kingdom of hell was divided against itself; how then could it stand! And if they said that Jesus cast out devils by the prince of the devils, they could not prove that their children cast them out by any other power. There are two great interests in the world; and when unclean spirits are cast out by the Holy Spirit, in the conversion of sinners to a life of faith and obedience, the kingdom of God is come unto us. All who do not aid or rejoice in such a change are against Christ.</body></html>
