St. Matthew had probably known something of each of those types of character, and felt how different that of the Christ was from all of them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall not strive, nor cry</span>. In Isaiah the clause is, "He shall not cry aloud nor lift up <span class="accented">his voice</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5e6;&#x5e2;&#x5e7;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5d0;</span>);" and so the LXX. But "strive" would represent one very frequent connotation of "cry aloud" and its synonyms, for in Eastern lands disputants use their voice much more loudly than we do. This close connexion between the two ideas is seen also in the Syriac Version of Isaiah,. where "lift up <span class="accented">his voice"</span> <span class="accented">is</span> translated <span class="accented">narib</span>, <span class="accented">a</span> word meaning primarily "he shall strive," and only secondarily "he shall lift up his voice." It is possible, but not probable, that Matthew's "strive" is taken directly from <span class="accented">narib</span>, adopting its primary and commoner meaning, and transposed. <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall any man hear his voice in the</span> <span class="cmt_word">streets.</span> A slight paraphrase of the original, "nor cause his voice to he heard in the street," perhaps due to different vocalization of the Hebrew. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:14-21 The Pharisees took counsel to find some accusation, that Jesus might be condemned to death. Aware of their design, as his time was not come, he retired from that place. Face does not more exactly answer to face in water, than the character of Christ drawn by the prophet, to his temper and conduct as described by the evangelists. Let us with cheerful confidence commit our souls to so kind and faithful a Friend. Far from breaking, he will strengthen the bruised reed; far from quenching the smoking flax, or wick nearly out, he will rather blow it up into a flame. Let us lay aside contentious and angry debates; let us receive one another as Christ receives us. And while encouraged by the gracious kindness of our Lord, we should pray that his Spirit may rest upon us, and make us able to copy his example.</body></html>
