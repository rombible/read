Jewish authors often appeal to Scripture in the order of Hagio-graphs, Prophets, and, last of all, Law. He here refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-8.htm">Leviticus 24:8</a> (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-32.htm">1 Chronicles 9:32</a>), but Bengel's suggestive remark that Leviticus was read in the services at that very time of year is vitiated by the double uncertainty, first, what time of year it really was; and secondly, what is the antiquity of the present custom of reading the whole Law every year (cf. Dr. Lumby on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13.htm">Acts 13</a>, 'Add. Note'). According to the express orders of the Law, the priests put in fresh shewbread on the sabbath day. <span class="cmt_word">How that on the sabbath days</span> <span class="cmt_word">the priests in the temple.</span> The word of wider import is used (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">not</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>), because the Law still holds good. <span class="cmt_word">Profane the sabbath.</span> If their work is regarded in itself, as the action of my disciples is now regarded. <span class="cmt_word">And are blameless?</span> (<span class="accented">guiltless</span>, Revised Version, as also the Authorized Version in ver. 7); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the eyes of the Law.

(<span class="accented">i.e.</span> 'Hilkoth Korban Pesach,' &sect; 1.), "There is no sabbatism at all in the temple," appears to rest on a misunderstanding. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-8 Being in the corn-fields, the disciples began to pluck the ears of corn: the law of God allowed it, De 23:25. This was slender provision for Christ and his disciples; but they were content with it. The Pharisees did not quarrel with them for taking another man's corn, but for doing it on the sabbath day. Christ came to free his followers, not only from the corruptions of the Pharisees, but from their unscriptural rules, and justified what they did. The greatest shall not have their lusts indulged, but the meanest shall have their wants considered. Those labours are lawful on the sabbath day which are necessary, and sabbath rest is to froward, not to hinder sabbath worship. Needful provision for health and food is to be made; but when servants are kept at home, and families become a scene of hurry and confusion on the Lord's day, to furnish a feast for visitors, or for indulgence, the case is very different. Such things as these, and many others common among professors, are to be blamed. The resting on the sabbath was ordained for man's good, De 5:14. No law must be understood so as to contradict its own end. And as Christ is the Lord of the sabbath, it is fit the day and the work of it should be dedicated to him.</body></html>
