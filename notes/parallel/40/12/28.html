So in Old Testament language the fulness of the prophet's inspiration was expressed in the words, "the hand of the Lord was strong upon me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-14.htm" title="So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong on me.">Ezekiel 3:14</a>). The second hymn in the Ordination Service reproduces the symbolism in the words addressed to the Holy Spirit--<p>"In faithful hearts thou writ'st thy law,<p>The finger of God's hand;"<p>and it obviously connects itself with the older language which describes the Ten Commandments as written on the two tables of stone with "the finger of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm" title="And he gave to Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him on mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.">Exodus 31:18</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Then the kingdom of God is come unto you.</span>--The word describes a coming suddenly, unlooked for, sooner than men expected. The argument may be briefly formulated thus:--The work was confessedly superhuman, either from the power of Satan or that of God, but the former hypothesis was excluded by the reasoning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-25.htm" title="And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:">Matthew 12:25-27</a>; the latter was therefore the only explanation. But if so, if Jesus gave proof that He was thus filled with the power of the Spirit to heal and save, then He was what He claimed to be, the Head of the divine kingdom. That kingdom had burst upon men unawares.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - The argument continues: "But if this be so (I say nothing about your disciples, but speak only of my own works) - if I really cast out devils by God's help, this shows such a strange putting forth of God's strength that it can mean nothing else but the coming of the Messianic kingdom." Observe that this could not be affirmed from the success of the Pharisees' disciples, for with them expulsion of devils, even if it were real, was, as it were, accidental, standing in no close connexion with their work (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-22.htm">Matthew 7:22</a>, note). Besides, they did not, as our Lord did, claim to be the Messiah, and to inaugurate the kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God;</span> <span class="accented">but if I by the Spirit of God</span>, etc. (Revised Version).

Satan blinds the eyes by unbelief, and seals up the lips from prayer. The more people magnified Christ, the more desirous the Pharisees were to vilify him. It was evident that if Satan aided Jesus in casting out devils, the kingdom of hell was divided against itself; how then could it stand! And if they said that Jesus cast out devils by the prince of the devils, they could not prove that their children cast them out by any other power. There are two great interests in the world; and when unclean spirits are cast out by the Holy Spirit, in the conversion of sinners to a life of faith and obedience, the kingdom of God is come unto us. All who do not aid or rejoice in such a change are against Christ.</body></html>
