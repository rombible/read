The Talmud discusses the question, but does not decide it. Some casuists solved the problem by a compromise. The sheep was not to be pulled out of the pit till the Sabbath was over, but in the meantime it was lawful to supply it with fodder. In St. Mark and St. Luke the question is given in another form, and without the illustration, which we find in St. Luke, in another connection, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-5.htm" title="And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?">Luke 14:5</a>. Jesus bids the man with the withered hand stand up in the midst, and then puts the question, "Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath day or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?" The alternative thus presented as a dilemma was a practical answer to their casuistry. They would have said, "Leave the man as he is till the Sabbath is over;" and our Lord's answer is that in that case good would have been left undone, and that not to do good when it lies in our power is practically to do evil.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - Matthew alone on this occasion, but comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-5.htm">Luke 14:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto them</span>. Christ's answer appeals from intellectual and theoretical difficulties to the practical common sense of ordinary morality (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-5.htm">Romans 3:5-7</a>). Their own feelings would guide them to help a brute, much more a man. According to the parallel passages, our Lord first set the man in the midst of them, wishing, perhaps, to draw out their sympathy, and only afterwards spoke this verse of censure (see Chrysostom). <span class="cmt_word">What man shall there be among you, that</span> <span class="cmt_word">shall have one sheep.</span> One only, and therefore so much the dearer (Meyer). He would feel an interest in it as an animal that he had learned to love; and he would care for it as his property. In Christ's case also there was the love of man as man, and of man as belonging to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-5.htm">Luke 14:5</a> ("a son or an ox") the double thought is distributed over two objects; the man Would love his son, and care for his property in the ox. <span class="cmt_word">And if it</span> (<span class="accented">this</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?</span> Lightfoot ('Hor. Hebr.') confirms this from the Jerusalem Talmud and Maimonides. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:9-13 Christ shows that works of mercy are lawful and proper to be done on the Lord's day. There are more ways of doing well upon sabbath days, than by the duties of worship: attending the sick, relieving the poor, helping those who need speedy relief, teaching the young to care for their souls; these are doing good: and these must be done from love and charity, with humility and self-denial, and shall be accepted, Ge 4:7. This, like other cures which Christ wrought, had a spiritual meaning. By nature our hands are withered, and we are unable of ourselves to do any thing that is good. Christ only, by the power of his grace, cures us; he heals the withered hand by putting life into the dead soul, works in us both to will and to do: for, with the command, there is a promise of grace given by the word.</body></html>
