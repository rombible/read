The inner connection of thought is, however, clear enough. How was it, it might be asked, that Israel had sunk to such a depth of evil? and the answer was found in the similitude which thus opens. The phenomena which furnish the comparison were probably familiar enough. So far as possession was identical in its phenomena, wholly or in part, with insanity, there might be sudden and violent relapses after intervals of calmness and apparent cure. The spirit of the man, under the influence of exorcisms, or prayers, or the sympathy of friends, might assert its freedom for a time, and then yield again to the oppressor. In the history of such a demoniac, which our Lord narrates in the language of the popular belief, He sees a parable of the history of the Jewish people.<p><span class= "bld">Walketh through dry places.</span>--The description reflects the popular idea that the parched deserts of Syria and Arabia and Egypt were haunted by demons, who thence came to invade the bodies and the souls of men. So in the book of Tobit (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/tobit/8-3.htm" title="The which smell when the evil spirit had smelled, he fled into the utmost parts of Egypt, and the angel bound him.">Tobit 8:3</a>), the demon Asmodeus flees to the upper parts of Egypt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 43-45.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-24.htm">Luke 11:24-26</a>, almost verbally, but omitting the application at the end of our ver. 45. A solemn warning against a merely negative improvement. External preparation, mechanical religion, is insufficient; a definite acceptance of my teaching is required. Our Lord's primary thought Would appear to be the relation in which those to whom he was speaking stood to himself. But he frames his words so as to include the whole of that generation of Jews (vers. 39, 45) For his present hearers truly represented their contemporaries. Observe <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the close of this discourse resembles that of the sermon on the mount; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the connexion of <span class="accented">thought</span> is the same in Luke, though there the passage comes immediately after our ver. 30; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> if you are not with me you are really against me; you are only swept and garnished, and the evil spirit returns. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When</span>; <span class="accented">but</span>... <span class="accented">when</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>. St. Matthew does not bring this forward as a separate utterance; he wishes the connexion between it and the preceding to be seen. There is a contrast between the behaviour of the Ninevites and the Queen of Sheba, and that of the Jews. <span class="cmt_word">The unclean spirit</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-1.htm">Matthew 10:1</a>, note) <span class="cmt_word">is gone out of a</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">man</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). The first article is inserted for the sake of vividness; the second points back to the spirit; he leaves the man in whom he had dwelt. The two together make the saying parabolic instead of abstract. <span class="cmt_word">He walketh</span>; <span class="accented">passeth</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Perhaps merely "goes through," with the connotation of distance traversed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-15.htm">John 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-38.htm">Acts 9:38</a>), but probably "goes about," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to different spots (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-6.htm">Luke 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-4.htm">Acts 8:4, 40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-25.htm">Acts 20:25</a>, and so of a rumour being spread abroad, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-15.htm">Luke 5:15</a>), in restless wandering. <span class="cmt_word">Through dry</span> (<span class="accented">waterless</span>, Revised Version; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">places.</span> Which supplied nothing wherewith he might refresh himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1</a>), and which would, of course, have no houses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-4.htm">Psalm 107:4-7, 33-36</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Seeking rest</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28, 29</a>, notes), and findeth none; <span class="accented">and findeth it not</span> (Revised Version). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:38-45 Though Christ is always ready to hear and answer holy desires and prayers, yet those who ask amiss, ask and have not. Signs were granted to those who desired them to confirm their faith, as Abraham and Gideon; but denied to those who demanded them to excuse their unbelief. The resurrection of Christ from the dead by his own power, called here the sign of the prophet Jonah, was the great proof of Christ's being the Messiah. As Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale, and then came out again alive, thus Christ would be so long in the grave, and then rise again. The Ninevites would shame the Jews for not repenting; the queen of Sheba, for not believing in Christ. And we have no such cares to hinder us, we come not to Christ upon such uncertainties. This parable represents the case of the Jewish church and nation. It is also applicable to all those who hear the word of God, and are in part reformed, but not truly converted. The unclean spirit leaves for a time, but when he returns, he finds Christ is not there to shut him out; the heart is swept by outward reformation, but garnished by preparation to comply with evil suggestions, and the man becomes a more decided enemy of the truth. Every heart is the residence of unclean spirits, except those which are temples of the Holy Ghost, by faith in Christ.</body></html>
