The belief in demoniacal possession had as its natural accompaniment the claim on the part of those who could control the disordered reason of the possessed person of power to cast out the demon. We need not assume that such power was always a pretence, or rested only on spells and incantations. Earnestness, prayer, fasting, faith--these are always mighty in intensifying the power of will, before which the frenzied soul bows in submission or yields in confidence, and these may well have been found among the better and truer Pharisees. Our Lord's question, indeed, requires for its logical validity the admission that the "children" of the accusers did really cast out demons, and that not by Beelzebub.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27, 28.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-19.htm">Luke 11:19, 20</a>, almost verbally identical. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>).

"sons of the prophets"). <span class="cmt_word">Cast</span> them out? (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a>, note). For examples of such cases by others than professed followers of Christ, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-49.htm">Luke 9:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-13.htm">Acts 19:13</a>. Josephus also mentions some, but they are mere impostures; he <span class="accented">says</span> ('<span class="accented">Ant.</span>,' 08:02.5), "<span class="accented">Solomon</span> left behind him the manner of using exorcisms, by which they drive away demons, so that they never return, and this method of cure is of great force unto this day; for I have seen a certain man of my own country, whose name was Eleazar, releasing people that were demoniacal in the presence of Vespasian, and his sons, and his captains, and the whole multitude of his soldiers. The manner of the sure was this: he put a ring that had a root of one of those sorts mentioned by Solomon to the nostrils of the demoniac, after which he drew out the demon through his nostrils; and when the man fell down immediately, he abjured him to return into him no more, making still mention of Solomon, and reciting the incantations which he composed" (cf. also Dr. Cheatham's article on "Exorcism," in 'Dict. of Christian Antiq.'). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore they</span>. Emphatic (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>), and hence, presumably, the transposition in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">shall they. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Shall be your judges</span>. Our Lord asks the preceding question, neither denying nor affirming for himself the fact that their disciples cast out devils, but only by way of argument. He implies, "You will answer that they do so by God's help. If so, then your sons shall be your judges, convicting you of insincerity. You acknowledge that they work miracles by God's help, and you do not acknowledge that I do. But you cannot stop short there. You must acknowledge that I also cast out devils by God's help." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:22-30 A soul under Satan's power, and led captive by him, is blind in the things of God, and dumb at the throne of grace; sees nothing, and says nothing to the purpose. Satan blinds the eyes by unbelief, and seals up the lips from prayer. The more people magnified Christ, the more desirous the Pharisees were to vilify him. It was evident that if Satan aided Jesus in casting out devils, the kingdom of hell was divided against itself; how then could it stand! And if they said that Jesus cast out devils by the prince of the devils, they could not prove that their children cast them out by any other power. There are two great interests in the world; and when unclean spirits are cast out by the Holy Spirit, in the conversion of sinners to a life of faith and obedience, the kingdom of God is come unto us. All who do not aid or rejoice in such a change are against Christ.</body></html>
