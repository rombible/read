The shewbread, or "bread of oblation," consisted of twelve loaves, in two rows of six each, which were offered every Sabbath day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-30.htm" title="And you shall set on the table show bread before me always.">Exodus 25:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-23.htm" title="And he set the bread in order on it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.">Exodus 40:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/24-5.htm" title="And you shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake.">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>), the loaves of the previous week being then removed and reserved for the exclusive use of the priests. The necessity of the case, however, was in this instance allowed to override the ceremonial ordinance, and our Lord teaches men through that single instance to see the general principle that when positive commands and necessities involving the good of man come into collision, the latter, not the former, must prevail.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How he entered into the house of God,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and did eat;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and they did eat</span>, with Revised Version margin (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), the simple plural verb laying the action less at David's door than does the phrase in the parallel passages - "and he gave" them to eat.

This was slender provision for Christ and his disciples; but they were content with it. The Pharisees did not quarrel with them for taking another man's corn, but for doing it on the sabbath day. Christ came to free his followers, not only from the corruptions of the Pharisees, but from their unscriptural rules, and justified what they did. The greatest shall not have their lusts indulged, but the meanest shall have their wants considered. Those labours are lawful on the sabbath day which are necessary, and sabbath rest is to froward, not to hinder sabbath worship. Needful provision for health and food is to be made; but when servants are kept at home, and families become a scene of hurry and confusion on the Lord's day, to furnish a feast for visitors, or for indulgence, the case is very different. Such things as these, and many others common among professors, are to be blamed. The resting on the sabbath was ordained for man's good, De 5:14. No law must be understood so as to contradict its own end. And as Christ is the Lord of the sabbath, it is fit the day and the work of it should be dedicated to him.</body></html>
