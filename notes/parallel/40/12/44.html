The latter belongs to the interpretation of the parable as a whole. The former portrays the state of the man who has been delivered from the wildness of frenzy, but has been left to the routine of common life and conventional morality, with no higher spiritual influence to protect and guard him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then he saith, I will return into</span> <span class="cmt_word">my house from whence I came out.</span> In the true text the emphasis lies on the words, "into my house;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the place that I have found so comfortable before, where I was so thoroughly at home; which, in fact, is still mine. Observe the curious parallel to <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-25.htm">Matthew 10:25</a>. The Jews had called Christ Beelzebub absolutely without reason, but in their own ease it was only too possible that they had an unclean spirit as "master of the house." <span class="cmt_word">And when he is come, he findeth it empty,</span> unoccupied (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Swept</span>; "cleansed with besoms" (Wickliffe); <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And garnished</span>; "made fair" (Wickliffe); <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. It had no tenant, but it was fully prepared for one; all the rubbish had been removed, and suitable preparations been made. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:38-45 Though Christ is always ready to hear and answer holy desires and prayers, yet those who ask amiss, ask and have not. Signs were granted to those who desired them to confirm their faith, as Abraham and Gideon; but denied to those who demanded them to excuse their unbelief. The resurrection of Christ from the dead by his own power, called here the sign of the prophet Jonah, was the great proof of Christ's being the Messiah. As Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale, and then came out again alive, thus Christ would be so long in the grave, and then rise again. The Ninevites would shame the Jews for not repenting; the queen of Sheba, for not believing in Christ. And we have no such cares to hinder us, we come not to Christ upon such uncertainties. This parable represents the case of the Jewish church and nation. It is also applicable to all those who hear the word of God, and are in part reformed, but not truly converted. The unclean spirit leaves for a time, but when he returns, he finds Christ is not there to shut him out; the heart is swept by outward reformation, but garnished by preparation to comply with evil suggestions, and the man becomes a more decided enemy of the truth. Every heart is the residence of unclean spirits, except those which are temples of the Holy Ghost, by faith in Christ.</body></html>
