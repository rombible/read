For them "this world"--better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">this age</span>--was the time before the coming of the Christ; "the age to come" was that which was to follow it. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-5.htm" title="And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,">Hebrews 6:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-30.htm" title="Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.">Luke 18:30</a>.) Our Lord thus stood on the boundary-line of the two ages, that of the Law and the Prophets, and that of the Kingdom of Heaven, and He declares that while all personal outrages to Himself as the Son of Man, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the Christ, are capable of forgiveness, this enmity against goodness, as good, shuts it out in both. Practically, however, the order of things since the first coming of the Christ has been one of slow and continuous growth, not of rapid and complete change. There has been no "age to come" such as the Jew dreamt of, and we still wait for its manifestation, and think of ourselves as still living in "<span class= "ital">this</span> world," in "<span class= "ital">this</span> age," and of the "world to come" as lying in the far future, or, for each individual soul, beyond the grave. Our Lord's words, it may be noted, clearly imply that some sins wait for their full forgiveness, the entirely cancelling of the past, till the time of that "age to come" which shall witness the great and final Advent. Does this imply that repentance, and therefore pardon, may come in the state that follows death? We know not, and ask questions that we cannot answer, but the words at least check the harsh dogmatic answer in the negative. If one sin only is thus excluded from forgiveness in that "coming age," other sins cannot stand on the same level, and the darkness behind the veil is lit up with at least a gleam of hope.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - Our Lord applies the general principle of ver. 31 to "blasphemy" against himself. This might be, comparatively speaking, innocuous if it was merely defamation or detraction of him as man; but if, on the other hand, it referred to his work in such a way as to mean a real detraction of God's actions considered as Divine, it indicated a state of feeling which did not admit of forgiveness (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). If it be asked whether the individual Pharisees referred to in vers. 24-28 had committed this sin, the answer depends upon whether they had recognized the hand of God as such, and had, notwithstanding, wilfully rejected it. If they had - as our Lord's tone seems to imply - then they had in fact committed it. Yet they may afterwards have repented, and so have come under a different category. <span class="cmt_word">And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>, note); <span class="accented">e.g.</span> his birth, the circumstances of his life on earth, or his decisions respecting the sabbath or meats, or his disregard of the conventionalities of his time in his treatment of "sinners" and publicans. All such things must have been included in those which St. Paul once blasphemed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">It</span> <span class="cmt_word">shall be forgiven him: but</span> <span class="cmt_word">whosoever speaketh</span> (such a word) <span class="cmt_word">against the Holy Ghost</span> (<span class="accented">the Holy Spirit</span>, Revised Version), <span class="cmt_word">it</span> <span class="cmt_word">shall not be forgiven him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). The margin of Westcott and Hort, with the Vatican manuscript, represents it still more strongly (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Neither in this world</span> (<span class="accented">age</span>, Revised Version margin), <span class="cmt_word">neither in the world to</span> <span class="cmt_word">come.</span> "The age to come" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;</span>) included all that followed the coming of Messiah. Sometimes it was restricted to, or practically identified with, the reign of Messiah upon earth, but usually it included much more - eternity as well as time (see especially Weber, 'System,' pp. 354, 355; and cf. Schurer, II. 2:177). It is in its widest sense that our Lord here uses it - contrasting the present order of things with that which will be the final result of his coming, his thoughts travelling far beyond the present course of this world to that which is to be hereafter. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:31,32 Here is a gracious assurance of the pardon of all sin upon gospel terms. Christ herein has set an example to the sons of men, to be ready to forgive words spoken against them. But humble and conscientious believers, at times are tempted to think they have committed the unpardonable sin, while those who have come the nearest to it, seldom have any fear about it. We may be sure that those who indeed repent and believe the gospel, have not committed this sin, or any other of the same kind; for repentance and faith are the special gifts of God, which he would not bestow on any man, if he were determined never to pardon him; and those who fear they have committed this sin, give a good sign that they have not. The trembling, contrite sinner, has the witness in himself that this is not his case.</body></html>
