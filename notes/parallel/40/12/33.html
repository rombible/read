As spoken to men of neutral, half-hearted character, they might seem a call, not without a touch of indignant rebuke, to consistency. "At least be thorough; lot principles and actions harmonise. Do not think you can produce the fruit of good works from the tree of a corrupt heart." This, however, is not their meaning here. The men to whom our Lord spoke were not neutral, but in direct hostility to Him, and here, therefore, He presses on them logical rather than practical consistency; "make," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> reckon, the tree and the fruit as having the same character. If to cast out demons be a good work, then the power from which it flows must be good also. Works of that kind do not come from a corrupt source.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 33-37.</span> - You wonder that I make so much of words; words are not trivialities, but are really the legitimate and normal fruit of the heart, and therefore by them each man will be judged. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Take your choice; half-heartedness is not enough (cf. ver. 30); the fruit tells the nature of the tree (ver. 33). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Our Lord addresses the Pharisees directly, showing them their true character.

Not "suppose" (<span class="accented">fac</span>, <span class="accented">pone</span>), still less "declare," but "make." The Lord is speaking in a parable. You would not, surely, make a tree in any other way; it would be against nature; how then imagine it can be so in your own persons? <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-18.htm">Matthew 7:18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-43.htm">Luke 6:43</a> state as a fact that the reverse case does not take place in nature. <span class="cmt_word">The tree</span> <span class="cmt_word">good, and his fruit good</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> one if the other); <span class="cmt_word">or</span> <span class="cmt_word">else make the tree</span> <span class="cmt_word">corrupt</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-17.htm">Matthew 7:17</a>, note), <span class="cmt_word">and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.</span> "By his own fruit" (Luke). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:33-37 Men's language discovers what country they are of, likewise what manner of spirit they are of. The heart is the fountain, words are the streams. A troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring, must send forth muddy and unpleasant streams. Nothing but the salt of grace, cast into the spring, will heal the waters, season the speech, and purify the corrupt communication. An evil man has an evil treasure in his heart, and out of it brings forth evil things. Lusts and corruptions, dwelling and reigning in the heart, are an evil treasure, out of which the sinner brings forth bad words and actions, to dishonour God, and hurt others. Let us keep constant watch over ourselves, that we may speak words agreeable to the Christian character.</body></html>
