The narratives in St. Matthew and St. Mark convey the impression that it was on the same Sabbath. St. Luke, however, as if he had made more careful inquiry, states definitely that it was on another, and this the others do not directly contradict.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-14.</span> - The <span class="accented">healing of the man with the withered hand.</span> Parallel passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-1.htm">Mark 3:1-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-6.htm">Luke 6:6-11</a>. In vers. 10, 11 there are reminiscences of a narrative, presumably belonging to the Framework, which is essentially preserved in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-2.htm">Luke 14:2-5</a> (cf. Weiss). In this section the opposition of the Pharisees is turned directly against our Lord himself for breaking the sabbath. Observe, however, that he did not do this for his own benefit. It was his kindness to another that brought about the determination to kill him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he was departed thence</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). The phrase implies more than removal from that place in the corn-fields where he had been accused by the Pharisees, and is to be understood of removal from one town to another, the words that originally preceded this narrative not being recorded (cf. <span class="accented">infra</span>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-1.htm">Matthew 11:1</a>, note). When. therefore, it took place we have absolutely no means of knowing, save that it was not on the same day as the event recorded in vers. 1-8 (cf. Luke, "on another sabbath"), and that it was later on in his ministry. <span class="cmt_word">He went into their synagogue</span>. Whose? Hardly the Pharisees mentioned in ver. 2, as this was a different occasion. Possibly the Galilaeans, among whom he then was (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-35.htm">Matthew 9:35</a>), or probably the Jews generally (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-1.htm">Matthew 11:1</a>, note). In the two last cases the subject of "they asked," in ver. 10, would be the same as that of "they watched." in Mark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-2.htm">Mark 3:2</a>), namely, the frequenters of the synagogue. among whom the Pharisees naturally took a prominent place. But it is quite possible that we have here a trace of the use of a fresh source, the <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> being quite intelligible in its original context. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:9-13 Christ shows that works of mercy are lawful and proper to be done on the Lord's day. There are more ways of doing well upon sabbath days, than by the duties of worship: attending the sick, relieving the poor, helping those who need speedy relief, teaching the young to care for their souls; these are doing good: and these must be done from love and charity, with humility and self-denial, and shall be accepted, Ge 4:7. This, like other cures which Christ wrought, had a spiritual meaning. By nature our hands are withered, and we are unable of ourselves to do any thing that is good. Christ only, by the power of his grace, cures us; he heals the withered hand by putting life into the dead soul, works in us both to will and to do: for, with the command, there is a promise of grace given by the word.</body></html>
