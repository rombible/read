In each of these aspects the words of Isaiah found their highest fulfilment in the Son of Man. In referring these words to the Messiah, the Evangelist was following in the footsteps of the Chaldee Paraphrase, but we must remember also that the words recorded as heard at the Baptism of Jesus (almost verbally identical with those of the prophecy now cited) must also have suggested the application, especially as connected with the promise, "I will put My Spirit upon Him," which had then received its fulfilment.<p><span class= "bld">He shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.</span>--The word "judgment" has a wide range of meaning in the Hebrew of Isaiah, and includes the work of a king, as teaching, no less than as executing, righteousness. As yet, of course, the work of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles had not begun, but St. Matthew notes, as it were, by anticipation, the spirit of love and gentleness which, when he wrote his Gospel, had brought them also within the range of the judgments--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> of the life-giving truths--of the righteous Judge. It is one of the many instances in which his record, though obviously written for Jews, is yet emphatically a Gospel for the Gentiles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold my servant</span>.

According to the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-1.htm">1 Chronicles 29:1</a>, David's expression about Solomon affords a curious parallel, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f91;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (edit. Dr. Swete). But Lagarde's edition of the Lucianic text punctuates and accents differently, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f91;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and this is much nearer to the Hebrew. <span class="cmt_word">My beloved, in whom my soul is well</span> <span class="cmt_word">pleased</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, note): <span class="cmt_word">I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall show</span> (declare, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">judgment to the Gentiles</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>). Although <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> usually represents in the New Testament God's decision as to the character and life of men, it here must be understood, like <span class="accented">mishpat</span> in the original, of the Divine right as made known to them for their acceptance and imitation. It is "the true religion viewed on its practical side as a norm and standard for life in all its relations" (Delitzsch). The thought here, therefore, is not of Christ's power to punish and avenge (though he refused to use it as yet), but of his bringing a revelation which should eventually spread, not only to the Jews who now rejected him, but to the Gentiles whom they despised. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:14-21 The Pharisees took counsel to find some accusation, that Jesus might be condemned to death. Aware of their design, as his time was not come, he retired from that place. Face does not more exactly answer to face in water, than the character of Christ drawn by the prophet, to his temper and conduct as described by the evangelists. Let us with cheerful confidence commit our souls to so kind and faithful a Friend. Far from breaking, he will strengthen the bruised reed; far from quenching the smoking flax, or wick nearly out, he will rather blow it up into a flame. Let us lay aside contentious and angry debates; let us receive one another as Christ receives us. And while encouraged by the gracious kindness of our Lord, we should pray that his Spirit may rest upon us, and make us able to copy his example.</body></html>
