Our Lord does not speak, as we might have expected, of "every evil word," but of "every idle--i.e., useless and purposeless--word," the random utterances which, as being more spontaneous, betray character more than deliberate speech. Such an "idle word" had been the passing taunt, "He casteth out devils by Beelzebub." It is not said, however, that for every such random speech a man shall be condemned, but that he shall give an account for it.

Nothing but the salt of grace, cast into the spring, will heal the waters, season the speech, and purify the corrupt communication. An evil man has an evil treasure in his heart, and out of it brings forth evil things. Lusts and corruptions, dwelling and reigning in the heart, are an evil treasure, out of which the sinner brings forth bad words and actions, to dishonour God, and hurt others. Let us keep constant watch over ourselves, that we may speak words agreeable to the Christian character.</body></html>
