The evangelist thus completes the parallelism with the end of the first stanza (ver. 18) However Jews treat Messiah, Gentiles shall place their hope in his Name, which, in fact, sums up for man all that can be known of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>, note). <span class="accented">In his Name.</span> So even the LXX. But the Hebrew, "in his Law." <span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is possibly due to a confusion with <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;</span>, but is more probably merely a paraphrase bringing out more clearly the fact that the Christian religion is emphatically trust in a Person. <span class="accented">The Gentiles</span>; rather, <span class="accented">Gentiles</span>, as such. This paraphrase for "isles" in the original is also found in the LXX. (For the whole verse, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, an utterance never lost sight of by the evangelist.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:14-21 The Pharisees took counsel to find some accusation, that Jesus might be condemned to death. Aware of their design, as his time was not come, he retired from that place. Face does not more exactly answer to face in water, than the character of Christ drawn by the prophet, to his temper and conduct as described by the evangelists. Let us with cheerful confidence commit our souls to so kind and faithful a Friend. Far from breaking, he will strengthen the bruised reed; far from quenching the smoking flax, or wick nearly out, he will rather blow it up into a flame. Let us lay aside contentious and angry debates; let us receive one another as Christ receives us. And while encouraged by the gracious kindness of our Lord, we should pray that his Spirit may rest upon us, and make us able to copy his example.</body></html>
