They assert that this also came within the limits of His jurisdiction as the Messiah, just as the power to forgive sins had been claimed by Him under the same title. In both instances, however, the choice of the title is significant. What is done is done by Him as the representative of humanity, acting, as it were, in its name, and claiming for it as such what He thus seems at first to claim for Himself as a special and absolute prerogative.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - Parallel passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-28.htm">Mark 2:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-5.htm">Luke 6:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">For</span>. With immediate refer-once to <span class="accented">guiltless. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day</span>; <span class="accented">is Lord of the sabbath</span> (Revised Version); <span class="accented">ere</span>, being added in the Received Text from Mark and Luke. Christ clinches the argument, and at the same time explains his phrase in ver. 6. The temple is greater than the sabbath; I am greater than the temple; these my disciples are therefore guiltless; for, to put it briefly, I, whom they are following, am greater than the sabbath and rule over it. Observe, however, that Christ does not directly say "I," but <span class="accented">the Son of man.</span> The reason is seen in Mark, where a connecting link is given: "The sabbath was made for man. and not man for the sabbath: so that the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath." Christ there implies that the sabbath is inferior to man, not only because it exists for his sake (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-9.htm">1 Corinthians 11:9</a>),but also because it falls under the lordship referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>; and therefore that he himself is really superior to it as man, and much more as the ideal Man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>, note). Our saying is very condensed, but includes the name thought, omitting <span class="accented">even</span> as unnecessary, after having definitely pronounced the innocence of his disciples. (For the thought of the saying, cf. 2 Macc. 5:19, "God did not choose the people for the place's sake, but the place for the people's sake," and the Midrash 'Mechilta,' on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13</a>, especially the words, "The sabbath is given to you, not yon to the sabbath." So also Talm. Bab., 'Yoma,' 85 <span class="accented">b</span>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-8 Being in the corn-fields, the disciples began to pluck the ears of corn: the law of God allowed it, De 23:25. This was slender provision for Christ and his disciples; but they were content with it. The Pharisees did not quarrel with them for taking another man's corn, but for doing it on the sabbath day. Christ came to free his followers, not only from the corruptions of the Pharisees, but from their unscriptural rules, and justified what they did. The greatest shall not have their lusts indulged, but the meanest shall have their wants considered. Those labours are lawful on the sabbath day which are necessary, and sabbath rest is to froward, not to hinder sabbath worship. Needful provision for health and food is to be made; but when servants are kept at home, and families become a scene of hurry and confusion on the Lord's day, to furnish a feast for visitors, or for indulgence, the case is very different. Such things as these, and many others common among professors, are to be blamed. The resting on the sabbath was ordained for man's good, De 5:14. No law must be understood so as to contradict its own end. And as Christ is the Lord of the sabbath, it is fit the day and the work of it should be dedicated to him.</body></html>
