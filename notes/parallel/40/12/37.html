In this sense we are able to understand (without entering into the labyrinth of logomachies in which commentators on the Epistles have too often entangled themselves) how it is that men are said to be justified by faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-28.htm" title="Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.">Romans 3:28</a> <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> justified by works (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-24.htm" title="You see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.">James 2:24</a>), justified--as here--by words. All three--faith, works, words--are alike elements of a man's character, making or showing what he is. Faith, implying trust and therefore love, justifies as the root element of character; "words," as its most spontaneous manifestation; works, as its more permanent results. Of the words and the works men can in some measure judge, and they are the tests by which a man should judge himself. The faith which lies deeper in the life is known only to God, and it is therefore by faith rather than by works that a man is justified before God, though the faith is no true faith unless it moulds the character and therefore enables the man to pass the other tests also.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For by</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>) - referring to, as it were, the source of the verdict - <span class="cmt_word">thy</span> <span class="cmt_word">words</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>); <span class="accented">thy</span>, individualizing. Ob-nerve the change from <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (ver. 36), which might in itself refer to the utterance of a madman, or to a parrot-like quotation. But by here using <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> our Lord shows that he is thinking of utterances of the reason. sentences spoken with a knowledge of their meaning, and forming parts of what are virtually, though not literally, discourses.

The heart is the fountain, words are the streams. A troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring, must send forth muddy and unpleasant streams. Nothing but the salt of grace, cast into the spring, will heal the waters, season the speech, and purify the corrupt communication. An evil man has an evil treasure in his heart, and out of it brings forth evil things. Lusts and corruptions, dwelling and reigning in the heart, are an evil treasure, out of which the sinner brings forth bad words and actions, to dishonour God, and hurt others. Let us keep constant watch over ourselves, that we may speak words agreeable to the Christian character.</body></html>
