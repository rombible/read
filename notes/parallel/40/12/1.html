The question, what is meant by that term, will be discussed in the Notes on that passage. The facts of the case place it clearly between the Passover and the Feast of Pentecost, between the beginning of the barley and the end of the wheat harvest. The position which the narrative occupies in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-23.htm" title="And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.">Mark 2:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-1.htm" title="And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.">Luke 6:1</a>, immediately after the feast in Matthew's house, differs so widely from St. Matthew's arrangement, that we are again at sea in attempting to construct a harmony, and can only regard the words "at that time" as belonging to the separate history in some other position than that in which he has placed it.<p><span class= "bld">Began to pluck the ears of corn.</span>--Note St. Mark's stronger phrase, "to make a path, plucking the ears," and St. Luke's description that they ate them, "rubbing them in their hands." The act was permitted by the Law as far as the rights of property were concerned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-25.htm" title="When you come into the standing corn of your neighbor, then you may pluck the ears with your hand; but you shall not move a sickle to your neighbor's standing corn.">Deuteronomy 23:25</a>), but it was against the Pharisees' interpretation of the law of the Sabbath. To pluck the ears was to reap, to rub the husks from the grain was to thresh; and the new Teacher was therefore, they thought, tacitly sanctioning a distinct breach of the holiness of the day of rest.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-50.</span> - The opposition that our Lord met with <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from his enemies (vers. 1-45); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from his relations (vers. 46-50); and the manner in which he dealt with it. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-45.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">Opposition from his enemies.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> Conscious and wilful opposition (vers. 1-37). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="greek">&#x3b1;</span>) As regards the sabbath (vers. 1-14). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="greek">&#x3b2;</span>) An interlude.

It has been suggested that he was now on his way to the synagogue spoken of in ver. 9 (but see note there). Wherever he was going, it must have been within about three quarters of a mile distance (two thousand cubits; see Dr. Lumby, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-12.htm">Acts 1:12</a>, "a sabbath day's journey;" and Schurer, II. 2:102). <span class="cmt_word">On the sabbath day</span>.

It was legal to pluck corn from a field through which one passed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-25.htm">Deuteronomy 23:25</a>), and it is said to be allowed still; but as it was held by the scribes to be a form of reaping, and perhaps of threshing also, it was considered illegal on the sabbath (cf. Edersheim, 'Life,' 2:56). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-8 Being in the corn-fields, the disciples began to pluck the ears of corn: the law of God allowed it, De 23:25. This was slender provision for Christ and his disciples; but they were content with it. The Pharisees did not quarrel with them for taking another man's corn, but for doing it on the sabbath day. Christ came to free his followers, not only from the corruptions of the Pharisees, but from their unscriptural rules, and justified what they did. The greatest shall not have their lusts indulged, but the meanest shall have their wants considered. Those labours are lawful on the sabbath day which are necessary, and sabbath rest is to froward, not to hinder sabbath worship. Needful provision for health and food is to be made; but when servants are kept at home, and families become a scene of hurry and confusion on the Lord's day, to furnish a feast for visitors, or for indulgence, the case is very different. Such things as these, and many others common among professors, are to be blamed. The resting on the sabbath was ordained for man's good, De 5:14. No law must be understood so as to contradict its own end. And as Christ is the Lord of the sabbath, it is fit the day and the work of it should be dedicated to him.</body></html>
