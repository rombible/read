Of all the accusations brought against Him this was the one that caused the greatest Pain, and drew forth the most indignant answer. He had restored peace and joy, freedom of reason and will to those who had lost them, had been doing His Father's work on earth, and He was accused of being in league with the powers of evil. The work of healing was represented as the bait of the Tempter luring men to their final destruction.<p><span class= "bld">Every kingdom divided against itself.</span>--The answer assumes, as the teaching of the New Testament does from first to last, the existence of a kingdom of evil, compact and organised, with a distinct unity of purpose. The laws which govern the life of other kingdoms are applicable to that also. Its head and ruler was not likely to enter on a work which was self-destructive. Reason, calmness, peace, these were not his gifts to men.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-37.</span> - Our Lord shows the monstrous character of their accusation, and urges the need of a complete change at heart. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> An <span class="accented">a priori</span> argument that such an action on Satan's part, as they suppose, would be self-destructive (vers. 25, 26). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> An <span class="accented">argumentum ad hominem.</span> The Pharisees cannot logically and morally acknowledge that their disciples' miracles are performed by Divine help without acknowledging that Jesus' miracles are also. But then they ought to recognize what this implies-that the kingdom of God has come (vers. 27, 28). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> This last alternative is true; for how otherwise can they explain the fact of Satan's captives being released (ver. 29)? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> An appeal to them and to the bystanders to be decided (ver. 30). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> Therefore he warns them solemnly against committing the sin for which there is no forgiveness (vers. 31, 32). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> Why be surprised at this language?

It is by words that men will be judged (vers. 36, 37). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - Vers 25, 26, parallel passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-24.htm">Mark 3:24, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-17.htm">Luke 11:17, 18</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus knew their thoughts</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-4.htm">Matthew 9:4</a>, note), and said unto them, <span class="cmt_word">Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation</span>. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-23.htm">Mark 3:23</a>, our Lord begins with the direct retort, "How can Satan cast out Satan?" But while that gives, of course, our Lord's thought, it is very unlike his method, which is to begin his reply with a parabolic saying. <span class="cmt_word">And every city</span>. Matthew only. <span class="cmt_word">Or house divided against itself</span>. It is worth noticing that, apart from all metaphor, the peasants' houses in some districts of Palestine are built of such poor material as to easily give way and burst in half (cf. Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' p. 390, edit. 1887). <span class="cmt_word">Shall not stand</span>. Neither kingdom, town, nor family can endure such self-destruction; no, nor an individual. There is, too, the further thought that Satan is more than a mere individual; that he is bound up with his kingdom, and his kingdom with him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:22-30 A soul under Satan's power, and led captive by him, is blind in the things of God, and dumb at the throne of grace; sees nothing, and says nothing to the purpose. Satan blinds the eyes by unbelief, and seals up the lips from prayer. The more people magnified Christ, the more desirous the Pharisees were to vilify him. It was evident that if Satan aided Jesus in casting out devils, the kingdom of hell was divided against itself; how then could it stand! And if they said that Jesus cast out devils by the prince of the devils, they could not prove that their children cast them out by any other power. There are two great interests in the world; and when unclean spirits are cast out by the Holy Spirit, in the conversion of sinners to a life of faith and obedience, the kingdom of God is come unto us. All who do not aid or rejoice in such a change are against Christ.</body></html>
