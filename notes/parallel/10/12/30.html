But there were various other Eastern talents, as the Babylonian and Persian, of much smaller weight, and it is not unlikely that a light talent may have been in use among the Ammonites. The weight, however, on any reasonable supposition, would have been too great to allow of this crown being commonly worn.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their king;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">Malcam.</span> This is another mode of spelling Milcom, the god of the Ammonites, and is found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>, and probably in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>. Strictly, Milcom or Malcom is a proper name for the supreme deity, formed from the word <span class="accented">melec</span>, a king, or, as it was pronounced in other Semitic dialects, Moloch. Grammatically, <span class="accented">Malcam</span> also means "their king," and even so belongs to Milcom. For the crown weighed a hundred pounds, a ponderous mass, which no man could possibly bear, and, least of all, when making, as was the case with the Ammonite king, his last stand for his life. But after the capture of the city, it was lifted from the head of the idol, and placed formally upon David's head, and held there for a few moments, as a sign of victory and of rejoicing over the fall of the false god. There is no reason for supposing that there is any exaggeration in the weight, nor will the Hebrew allow us to understand the talent of gold as referring to its value. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:26-31 To be thus severe in putting the children of Ammon to slavery was a sign that David's heart was not yet made soft by repentance, at the time when this took place. We shall be most compassionate, kind, and forgiving to others, when we most feel our need of the Lord's forgiving love, and taste the sweetness of it in our own souls.</body></html>
