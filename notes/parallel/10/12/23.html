Hence some have supposed that, as Solomon is placed last of Bathsheba's four sons in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-14.htm">2 Samuel 5:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>, three other sons had already been borne by her, and that consequently this child, the fruit of their adultery, would now have been seven or eight years of age. It is certainly remarkable that in ver. 16 David calls him "the lad" (so the Hebrew), though in every other place he is styled "the child." On the other hand, we gather from ver. 14 that probably he was as yet the only child, and this is the more reasonable view, even if Solomon was the youngest son (but see note on ver. 24). But secondly, the words indicate a belief in the continued existence of the child, and even that David would recognize and know him in the future world. Less than this would have given no comfort to the father for his loss. Now, it is true that we can find no clear dogmatic teaching in the early Scriptures upon the immortality of the soul. Job could give expression to no such hope in Job 7:6-10, and the belief in a world to come would have solved the difficulties of himself and his friends, which really are left unsolved. Even in the Psalms there are words that border on despair (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-5.htm">Psalm 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-9.htm">Psalm 30:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-11.htm">Psalm 88:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-17.htm">Psalm 115:17</a>); nor had Hezekiah any such belief in continued existence as could solace him in the expectation of an early death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18, 19</a>). This hopelessness was not unnatural at a time when the doctrine had not been as yet clearly taught. On the other hand, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-15.htm">Psalm 17:15</a> and Psalm 16:9-11 We find proof that David did believe in his own immortality. For though the latter words have a second and higher meaning, yet the primary sense of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> is that David's own soul (or self) would not always remain in Sheol, the abode of the departed, nor would he, Jehovah's anointed one, see such corruption as would end in annihilation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:15-25 David now penned the 51st Psalm, in which, though he had been assured that his sin was pardoned, he prays earnestly for pardon, and greatly laments his sin. He was willing to bear the shame of it, to have it ever before him, to be continually upbraided with it. God gives us leave to be earnest with him in prayer for particular blessings, from trust in his power and general mercy, though we have no particular promise to build upon. David patiently submitted to the will of God in the death of one child, and God made up the loss to his advantage, in the birth of another. The way to have creature comforts continued or restored, or the loss made up some other way, is cheerfully to resign them to God. God, by his grace, particularly owned and favoured that son, and ordered him to be called Jedidiah, Beloved of the Lord. Our prayers for our children are graciously and as fully answered when some of them die in their infancy, for they are well taken care of, and when others live, beloved of the Lord.</body></html>
