Mephibosheth was likely to meet with no kind treatment from Absalom; but perhaps he was a visionary, and David may have thought that he was holding back for any chance that might turn up. But upon this slander David acts with blamable impetuosity, and, indignant that the son of his old friend should so desert him, he gives Ziba all his lands. The grant would be valid only if David's cause prevailed, and Ziba so far deserves credit in that he attached himself to a ruined man; but his motive was not love to David, but selfish calculation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-4 Ziba belied Mephibosheth.
