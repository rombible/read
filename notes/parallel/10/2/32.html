It thus appears that Zeruiah's husband (of whom there is no other mention) was also of Bethlehem. The burial must have taken place on the next day (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-30.htm" title="And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.">2Samuel 2:30</a>), and, with the previous march of ten miles, would have filled up that day. It was, therefore, twenty-four hours after the close of the battle before they were ready to start from Bethlehem. The night may have been chosen for the march to avoid the heat; and the distance from Bethlehem to Hebron was about thirteen miles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlehem.</span> The Name of Zeruiah's husband is never mentioned, but he was evidently of the same town as his wife, and at his death, when probably still young, he had received honourable sepulture. As Bethlehem is about eleven miles distant from Gideon, Joab probably marched thither straight from the battlefield, and spent the next day in paying the last tribute of respect to his brother, and in refreshing his men. At nightfall he resumed his march to Hebron, which was fifteen miles further to the south, and where he would arrive on the morning following that on which Abner reached Mahanaim. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:25-32 Abner appeals to Joab concerning the miserable consequences of a civil war. Those who make light of such unnatural contests, will find that they are bitterness to all concerned. How easy it is for men to use reason, when it makes for them, who would not use it, if it made against them! See how the issue of things alter men's minds! The same thing which looked pleasant in the morning, at night looked dismal. Those who are most forward to enter into contention, will repent before they have done with it, and had better leave it off before it be meddled with, as Solomon advises. This is true of every sin, oh that men would consider it in time, that it will be bitterness in the latter end! Asahel's funeral is here mentioned. Distinctions are made between the dust of some and that of others; but in the resurrection no difference will be made, but between the godly and ungodly, which will remain for ever.</body></html>
