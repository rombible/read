But the house of Judah followed David.">2Samuel 2:10</a>), Saul himself having reigned about forty years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-21.htm" title="And afterward they desired a king: and God gave to them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.">Acts 13:21</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Ish-bosheth.</span>--Called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-33.htm" title="And Ner begat Kish, and Kish begat Saul, and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.">1Chronicles 8:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-39.htm" title="And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.">1Chronicles 9:39</a>, "Eshbaal" (<span class= "ital">the fire of Baal</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>just as his nephew, Mephibosheth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-4.htm" title="And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.">2Samuel 4:4</a>), is called in the same places <span class= "ital">Meribaal, </span>and Gideon's surname Jerubbaal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-32.htm" title="Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he has thrown down his altar.">Judges 6:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-35.htm" title="Neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had showed to Israel.">Judges 8:35</a>) is changed to Jerubbesheth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-21.htm" title="Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone on him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went you near the wall? then say you, Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.">2Samuel 11:21</a>). These names compounded with Baal may have been originally given, as certainly was the case with Jerubbaal, in consequence of the manful opposition to idolatry of those who bore them, and have been subsequently changed to a compound with "bosheth" (<span class= "ital">shame</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>in view of the sequel of their histories; or, on the other hand, in the case of Saul's family the compound with Baal may have been a later name, given in view of their opposition to the divinely appointed king, and to mark God's utter rejection of the house of Saul.<p><span class= "bld">Mahanaim,</span> famous in the story of Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-2.htm" title="And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.">Genesis 32:2</a>), was on the east of the Jordan, and not far from the brook Jabbok. A Levitical city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-38.htm" title="And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim with her suburbs,">Joshua 21:38</a>), in comparative safety from the Philistines, was well chosen by Abner for the coronation and residence of his new king. Mahanaim afterwards became the place of refuge for David in his flight from Absalom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-24.htm" title="Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.">2Samuel 17:24</a>). The expression "brought him over" refers to the crossing of the Jordan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Abner</span>. This hero had been present at the battle of Gilboa, and probably had rallied many of the defeated Israelites, and made as much resistance as was possible to the onward march of the Philistines. And as soon as he had effected his retreat into the region beyond the Jordan, his power would be supreme. There was no one there to oppose the commander-in-chief of what remained of Saul's army. Certainly all that remained of Saul's body guard of three thousand men would gather round Abner, and as the Philistines did not push their pursuit further than the Jordan, he was free to do as he chose. Nor would there be any opposition. Abner was bound to do his best for Saul's family, and the people would feel this, and approve of his conduct in standing up for the children of their king. Moreover, David by his conduct had made himself an object of suspicion to all the valiant men who had formed Saul's army, and these would be the more embittered against him by their defeat. <span class="cmt_word">Ishbosheth</span>. This name signifies "man of shame," that is, "man of the shameful thing," the idol. Originally he was named Eshbaal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-33.htm">1 Chronicles 8:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-39.htm">1 Chronicles 9:39</a>), that is "man of Baal," the word <span class="accented">esh</span> being merely a dialectic variation for <span class="accented">ish</span>, equivalent to "man." At this early date Baal was not the specific name of any idol, but simply meant "lord," "master," "husband." In the earlier books of the Bible we find the word used of many local deities, who were lords of this or that, but had nothing in common with the Phoenician Baal, whose worship Ahab attempted to introduce into Israel. From that time Baal became a term of reproach, and Bosheth, "the shame," was substituted for it in the old names of which it had formed part. Thus Gideon is still called Jerubbaal in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-11.htm">1 Samuel 12:11</a>, but the title is transformed into Jerubbesheth, or more correctly, Jerubbosheth, "let the shame plead," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-21.htm">2 Samuel 11:21</a>. Originally, therefore, the name Ishbaal had no discreditable meaning, but signified, "man of the Lord," or, as Ewald supposes, "lordly man." It was not till long afterwards, when Israel had been horrified by Jezebel's doings, that Baal, except in the sense of "husband," became an ill-omened word. Jonathan, whose own name, "Jehovah's gift," in Greek Theodore, is proof sufficient that Saul's family were worshippers of the true God, called his son's name Meribbaal, "the Lord's strife" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-34.htm">1 Chronicles 8:34</a>). In some strange way this was altered into Mephibosheth, that is, "from the face of the shameful thing" (ch. 2 Samuel 4:4. etc.). Possibly it is a corruption of Meribbosheth, but it is remarkable that a son of Saul by his concubine Rizpah also bore the name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-8.htm">2 Samuel 21:8</a>). Among the ancestors of Saul, the simple name Baal, "Lord," occurs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-30.htm">1 Chronicles 8:30</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Mahanaim</span>. Abner chose this town because it was on the eastern side of the Jordan, and so beyond the range of the Philistines, who never seem to have crossed the river. It was situated on the borders of the tribe of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, from both of which valiant warriors had joined David; but the people generally were not ill affected to the house of Saul. As having been assigned to the Levites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-38.htm">Joshua 21:38</a>), it had a quasi-religious character, inherited from the vision of angels seen there by Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2</a>). As a safe, out of the way place, David subsequently took refuge there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-24.htm">2 Samuel 17:24</a>). (On its exact site, see Conder's 'Heth and Moab,' pp. 177-181.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-17. The nation in general refused David. By this the Lord trained up his servant for future honour and usefulness; and the tendency of true godliness was shown in his behaviour while passing through various difficulties. David was herein a type of Christ, whom Israel would not submit to, though anointed of the Father to be a Prince and a Saviour to them. Abner meant, Let the young men fight before us, when he said, Let them play before us: fools thus make a mock at sin. But he is unworthy the name of a man, that can thus trifle with human blood.</body></html>
