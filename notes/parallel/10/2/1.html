His inquiry was, doubtless, made through the high priest Abiathar, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/23-9.htm" title="And David knew that Saul secretly practiced mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring here the ephod.">1Samuel 23:9-10</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-20.htm" title="He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.">2Samuel 22:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-1.htm" title="Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,">2Samuel 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-4.htm" title="And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun rises, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.">2Samuel 23:4</a>). The answer definitely directed him to go up to Hebron.<p><span class= "bld">Hebron</span> is one of the most ancient cities of the world (built "seven years before Zoan in Egypt," <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-22.htm" title="And they ascended by the south, and came to Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)">Numbers 13:22</a>), long the residence of Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-18.htm" title="Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelled in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar to the LORD.">Genesis 13:18</a>), and the place where he and Sarah, Isaac and Jacob, were buried. Its original name was Kirjath-arba (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-2.htm" title="And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.">Genesis 23:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-15.htm" title="And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.">Joshua 14:15</a>, &c). It is situated in a valley among the hills of Southern Judea, at a height of nearly 3,000 feet above the Mediterranean. It is about twenty miles S.S.W. from Jerusalem, somewhat more than this N.E. of Beersheba, and about fifteen miles E.S.E. of the Philistine town of Gath. From Ziklag, where David had been living, it was distant about thirty-eight miles. It has always been famous for its vineyards, and its grapes are still considered the finest in Southern Palestine. The valley in which it is situated is probably the "valley of Eshcol," from which the spies brought the great "cluster of grapes" to Moses in the wilderness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-23.htm" title="And they came to the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it between two on a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.">Numbers 13:23</a>). It was a priestly city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/21-10.htm" title="Which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi, had: for theirs was the first lot.">Joshua 21:10-11</a>), and the most southerly of the cities of refuge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/20-7.htm" title="And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah.">Joshua 20:7</a>). Here was the home and the throne of David for the next seven and a half years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-11.htm" title="And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.">2Samuel 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-5.htm" title="In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.">2Samuel 5:5</a>). The larger part of the land, since the recent defeat, was in the power of the Philistines; and Hebron, on account of its situation at the far south, and its strategical strength, as well as its sacred associations, was a peculiarly fitting place for the beginning of David's reign.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto Hebron.</span> As soon as David had assuaged his grief, his thoughts would naturally turn towards his country. Fuller news would reach him every day respecting the movements of the Philistines, who, after so decisive a victory, would quickly overrun all the central districts of Palestine, where the battle had been fought. And very bitter must David's feelings have been. Had he continued in Israel, he and his six hundred men would now have hastened to the rescue, and all the braver warriors of the land would have gathered round them. As it was, he was too entangled with the Philistines, and too much distrusted by the northern tribes, to be of much use. Still, we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12.htm">1 Chronicles 12</a>, that brave men did continually swell the number of his followers. Detachments of the tribes of Gad and Manasseh, instead of joining Saul at Gilboa, went to David as he withdrew to Ziklag. And while he remained there a considerable body of men from Benjamin and Judah came to him under the command of Amasa, David's nephew. So numerous were they as to alarm David, who went out to meet them, fearing lest they had come to betray him; and glad was he to hear their answer, "Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse." Thus even as it was, his forces daily grew more numerous; for "from day today there came to David to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-22.htm">1 Chronicles 12:22</a>). But there was no national acknowledgment. With his numbers thus continually increasing, David was encouraged to make some attempt for the deliverance of Israel; but his position was one of serious danger. Great was the risk, but he knew where to go for guidance, and determines, therefore, to put the matter into God's hand. He summons Abiathar with the ephod, and, in the presence of his captains, asks for permission to go up to some city of his own tribe. The answer is favourable, and Hebron is the city selected. It was a place of ancient sanctity, was well situated in the mountains of Judah for defence, and as the Philistines bad not yet invaded that region, but probably would soon try to ravage it, the people would be sure to welcome the presence of one who brought with him a powerful body of trained men. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7. After the death of Saul, many went to David at Ziklag,</body></html>
