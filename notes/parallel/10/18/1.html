As Absalom gathered all Israel to him, there would be some delay; and David, like a wise general, made use of it for training the brave but undisciplined men who had joined him, chiefly from Gilead. Besides these, he had with him numerous veterans, whose skill and experience would be invaluable in such service. The result was that when the rebels came to close quarters, they had a vast body of men, but David a disciplined force, which, under skilful generalship, scattered Absalom's raw levies with ease. The arrangement into thousands and hundreds was in accordance with the civil divisions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-25.htm">Exodus 18:25</a>), both being, in fact, dictated by nature as multiples of our hands. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-8 How does David render good for evil!

This seems to be a resemblance of man's wickedness towards God, and God's mercy to man, of which it is hard to say which is most amazing. Now the Israelites see what it is to take counsel against the Lord and his anointed.</body></html>
