His act was simply murder. In a lawless age it was defensible as the one act which terminated the rebellion and made a renewal of it impossible, and destroyed a traitor and would-be parricide who was likely otherwise to escape punishment; but it was a distinct disobedience of express orders, and Joab's taking the execution into his own hands was wilful and deliberate murder.<p><span class= "bld">Three darts.</span>--The word means a <span class= "ital">rod </span>or <span class= "ital">staff. </span>Also the word <span class= "ital">heart </span>is the same as the following word <span class= "ital">midst, </span>and is not therefore to be taken too literally. Joab seized such sticks as were at hand in the wood and thrust them into Absalom, giving him most painful and probably mortal wounds, but not instantly killing him. Then (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-15.htm" title="And ten young men that bore Joab's armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.">2Samuel 18:15</a>) the ten men who had Joab's armour and weapons came up and finally killed Absalom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Three darts;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">three staves</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-21.htm">2 Samuel 23:21</a>). The weapons of the ancients were of a very inferior kind, and stakes sharpened at the end and hardened in the fire were used by the infantry, until the increasing cheapness of iron made it possible to supply them with pikes. Joab's act was not one of intentional cruelty, but, picking up the first weapons that came to hand, he hurried away to kill his victim. His thrusts with these pointed sticks were brutal, and inflicted mortal wounds; but as they were not immediately fatal, Joab's armour bearers, who had followed him, and who had with them Joab's own better weapons, were called upon to put an end to Absalom's sufferings. <span class="cmt_word">His heart</span> does not mean that organ anatomically, but the middle of his body. So at the end of the verse, <span class="cmt_word">in the midst of the oak,</span> is, in the Hebrew, <span class="accented">in the heart of the terebinth.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:9-18 Let young people look upon Absalom, hanging on a tree, accursed, forsaken of heaven and earth; there let them read the Lord's abhorrence of rebellion against parents. Nothing can preserve men from misery and contempt, but heavenly wisdom and the grace of God.</body></html>
