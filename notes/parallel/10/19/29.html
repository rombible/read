And Ziba said, I humbly beseech you that I may find grace in your sight, my lord, O king.">2Samuel 16:4</a>); he now saw the injustice of his hasty action, and ought at least to have reversed it, if not to have punished Ziba besides. Either, however, because he had still some doubt of the real merits of the case, or more probably because he was unwilling for political reasons to offend Ziba, he resorts to that halfway and compromise course which was both weak and unjust. The circumstances of the case, the continued mourning of Mephibosheth, the silence of Ziba, concur with the physical infirmity of Mephibosheth to show the truth of his story.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou and Ziba divide the land.</span> Two views are taken of this decision - the one, that it was a complete reversal of the command in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-4.htm">2 Samuel 16:4</a>, placing matters upon the old footing, by which Ziba was to have half the produce for cultivating the estate; the other, and apparently the most correct view, is that Ziba was now made actual owner of half the land, and Mephibosheth, instead of a half, would henceforth have only a quarter of the crops. The decision was not equitable, and David speaks in a curt and hurried manner, as though vexed with himself for what he was doing. As a matter of fact, Ziba's treachery had been most useful to David. Besides the pleasure at the time of finding one man faithful, when "all men were liars" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-11.htm">Psalm 116:11</a>), Ziba had been most active in bringing over the tribe of Benjamin to David's side; and though his motives were selfish and venal, yet, as the king reaped the benefit of his conduct, he was bound not to leave him without reward. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:24-30 David recalls the forfeiture of Mephibosheth's estate; and he expressed joy for the king's return. A good man contentedly bears his own losses, while he sees Israel in peace, and the Son of David exalted.</body></html>
