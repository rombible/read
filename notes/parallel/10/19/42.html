In this, then, may be a taunt to the Benjamites on account of the partiality shown them by Saul. On the other hand, the Israelites urge their claim of numerical superiority. The whole dispute is a remarkable testimony to the fairness of David's government as between the tribes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king is near of kin to us.</span> The pronouns are singular throughout: "He is near of kin to me. Why art thou angry? Have I eaten... I have ten parts... Why didst thou despise me?" and so everywhere. This is much more piquant; but such personification is contrary to the genius of our language. <span class="cmt_word">Have I eaten,</span> etc.? Saul had boasted of enriching the Benjamites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-7.htm">1 Samuel 22:7</a>), but probably the speaker intended only to protest the purity of his motives. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:40-43 The men of Israel though themselves despised, and the fiercer words of the men of Judah produced very bad effects. Much evil might be avoided, if men would watch against pride, and remember that a soft answer turneth away wrath. Though we have right and reason on our side, if we speak it with fierceness, God is displeased.</body></html>
