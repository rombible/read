This usage is well recognised at a later time (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/5-1.htm" title="Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he was the firstborn; but for as much as he defiled his father's bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright.">1Chronicles 5:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-15.htm" title="Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.">Amos 5:15</a>), and it has hence been argued that it indicates a late date for the composition of the book; but it is also found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/80-1.htm" title="Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you that lead Joseph like a flock; you that dwell between the cherubim, shine forth.">Psalm 80:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-5.htm" title="This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not.">Psalm 81:5</a> (the date of which it would be rash to attempt to fix), in the reign of Solomon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-28.htm" title="And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.">1Kings 11:28</a>, and probably very early in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-35.htm" title="But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.">Judges 1:35</a>. There is no reason why the expression may not have been used at the earliest date when there began to be a certain separation and distinction between Judah and the other tribes, which was soon after the conquest of Canaan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The first.., of all the house of Joseph.</span> Shimei, who was a Benjamite, could not have thus claimed to be the representative of the northern tribes, had he remained on the western bank, where "half the people of Israel" were assembled. Strictly, "the house of Joseph" signified the tribe of Ephraim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-22.htm">Judges 1:22, 35</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-67.htm">Psalm 78:67</a>), and in this sense Shimei did not belong to it. But Ephraim claimed a supremacy over all Israel; and one cause of the opposition to David certainly was the transference of the leadership to the tribe of Judah. Even the long reign of Solomon failed to weld the tribes together, and as soon as the reins of power fell into the weak hands of Rehobeam, an Ephraimite. Jeroboam, whom Solomon had made "ruler ever all the charge of the house of Joseph" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-28.htm">1 Kings 11:28</a>), quickly wrested the ten tribes from him. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-6.htm">Amos 5:6</a> "the house of Joseph" signifies all the northern tribes, for the reason given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1, 2</a>; and such is its sense here. And Shimei compressed many powerful arguments in the phrase. For as a Benjamite he offered David the allegiance of the tribe which had given Israel its first king; while, as an Israelite, he professed also to represent the leading house of Ephraim, and all the northern tribes which usually followed its bidding. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:16-23 Those who now slight and abuse the Son of David, would be glad to make their peace when he shall come in his glory; but it will be too late. Shimei lost no time. His abuse had been personal, and with the usual right feeling of good men, David could more easily forgive it.</body></html>
