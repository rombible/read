This exultation of David at the result of his wars is in accordance with the harsh treatment inflicted by him upon the vanquished. His enemies were God's enemies, whom he must consume. The "new commandment" of Christianity forbids and condemns this delight in conquest. Vers. 41-43. - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"And mine enemies thou hast made to turn upon me their back,<br />Even those that hate me; and have utterly destroyed them.<br />They looked, but there was none to save,<br />Even to Jehovah, but he answered them not.<br />And I beat them small as the dust of the earth;<br />As the mire of the streets I stamped upon them, I trode them down."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Those that hate me.</span> The sentence is to be completed from the previous clause, "my haters" and "my enemies" being equivalent. There are several small variations between the text here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, such as "they cried" for they looked; and "I emptied them out" for I stamped upon them, the difference in both cases consisting in a single letter. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-51 David's psalm of thanksgiving. - This chapter is a psalm of praise; we find it afterwards nearly as Ps 18. They that trust God in the way of duty, shall find him a present help in their greatest dangers: David did so. Remarkable preservations should be particularly mentioned in our praises. We shall never be delivered from all enemies till we get to heaven. God will preserve all his people, 2Ti 4:18. Those who receive signal mercies from God, ought to give him the glory. In the day that God delivered David, he sang this song. While the mercy is fresh, and we are most affected with it, let the thank-offering be brought, to be kindled with the fire of that affection. All his joys and hopes close, as all our hopes should do, in the great Redeemer.</body></html>
