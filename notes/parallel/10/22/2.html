For we may well believe that it was at a later period of his life, after deeper and more heart searching trials, that David thus felt his love to Jehovah only strengthened and made more necessary to him by the loss of his earthly happiness. In ver. 3, <span class="cmt_word">The God of my rock</span> is changed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a> into "My God my Rock" (Authorized Version, "strength") - probably an intentional alteration, as being far less rugged and startling than this bold metaphor of the Deity being his rock's God. In the original the words present each its distinct idea. Thus in ver. 2 the <span class="accented">rock</span> is a high cliff or precipice. It is the word <span class="accented">sela</span>, which gave its name to the crag city of Idumea. <span class="cmt_word">Fortress</span> really means a rock, difficult of access, and forming a secure retreat. It is entirely a natural formation, and not a building. In ver. 3 <span class="accented">rock</span> is a vast mountainous mass (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-4.htm">Job 18:4</a>), and, as it suggests the ideas of grandeur and immovable might, it is often used for God's glory as being the Strength and Protection of his people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-29.htm">Isaiah 30:29</a>, margin). Next follow two ordinary metaphors, the <span class="accented">shield</span> for defence, and the horn for attack; after which David, who had so often sought safety among the cliffs and fastnesses of the mountains, returns to the same circle of thoughts, and calls God his <span class="cmt_word">High Tower,</span> the word signifying, not a building, but a height, a lofty natural stronghold; and finally <span class="accented">his Refuge</span>, a place of safe retreat among the mountains. This and the rest of the verse are omitted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>. In ver. 4 the words are as literally translated above, and signify, "Whenever call, I am saved." In all times of difficulty, prayer brings immediate deliverance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-51 David's psalm of thanksgiving. - This chapter is a psalm of praise; we find it afterwards nearly as Ps 18. They that trust God in the way of duty, shall find him a present help in their greatest dangers: David did so. Remarkable preservations should be particularly mentioned in our praises. We shall never be delivered from all enemies till we get to heaven. God will preserve all his people, 2Ti 4:18. Those who receive signal mercies from God, ought to give him the glory. In the day that God delivered David, he sang this song. While the mercy is fresh, and we are most affected with it, let the thank-offering be brought, to be kindled with the fire of that affection. All his joys and hopes close, as all our hopes should do, in the great Redeemer.</body></html>
