In this psalm the cherub is his chariot, on which he rides forth to judgment. <span class="cmt_word">He was seen.</span> There can be little doubt that the right reading is preserved in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>, where we find a verb signifying the swooping down of a bird of prey upon its quarry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>).

The gathering of waters would describe the massing of the rain clouds. The difference here also consists only in one letter. <span class="cmt_word">Out of the brightness,</span> which closely surrounds the Deity in the midst of the black mass of the tempest, the lightning flashes forth. This brightness is the Shechinah (see above), to which St. Paul also refers where he says that God's dwelling is in "the unapproachable light" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-51 David's psalm of thanksgiving. - This chapter is a psalm of praise; we find it afterwards nearly as Ps 18. They that trust God in the way of duty, shall find him a present help in their greatest dangers: David did so. Remarkable preservations should be particularly mentioned in our praises. We shall never be delivered from all enemies till we get to heaven. God will preserve all his people, 2Ti 4:18. Those who receive signal mercies from God, ought to give him the glory. In the day that God delivered David, he sang this song. While the mercy is fresh, and we are most affected with it, let the thank-offering be brought, to be kindled with the fire of that affection. All his joys and hopes close, as all our hopes should do, in the great Redeemer.</body></html>
