The devout mind of the Orientals saw in everything that was more than common a manifestation of God, and thus the epithet "of God" came to be applied to anything that was very great (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-8.htm">Genesis 30:8</a>, margin; Genesis 35:5; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-9.htm">Psalm 65:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-3.htm">Jonah 3:3</a>, margin). David would show Saul's seed kindness as wonderful as are God's dealings with man. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-8 Amidst numerous affairs we are apt to forget the gratitude we owe, and the engagements we are under, not only to our friends, but to God himself. Yet persons of real godliness will have no rest till they have discharged them. And the most proper objects of kindness and charity, frequently will not be found without inquiry. Jonathan was David's sworn friend, therefore he shows kindness to his son Mephibosheth. God is faithful to us; let us not be unfaithful to one another. If Providence has raised us, and our friends and their families are brought low, we must look upon that as giving us the fairer opportunity of being kind to them.</body></html>
