When in the East your entertainer assures you that everything he has to his last dirhem is yours, he nevertheless expects you to pay twice the value foreverything you consume; but he makes his exaction pleasant by his extreme courtliness. So Ephron offered his cave at Machpelah to Abraham as a free gift, but he took care to obtain for it an exorbitant price (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-11.htm">Genesis 23:11, 15</a>). Mephibosheth described himself in terms similar to those used by David of himself to Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-14.htm">1 Samuel 24:14</a>); but he meant no more than to express great gratitude, and also to acknowledge the disparity of rank between him and the king. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-8 Amidst numerous affairs we are apt to forget the gratitude we owe, and the engagements we are under, not only to our friends, but to God himself. Yet persons of real godliness will have no rest till they have discharged them. And the most proper objects of kindness and charity, frequently will not be found without inquiry. Jonathan was David's sworn friend, therefore he shows kindness to his son Mephibosheth. God is faithful to us; let us not be unfaithful to one another. If Providence has raised us, and our friends and their families are brought low, we must look upon that as giving us the fairer opportunity of being kind to them.</body></html>
