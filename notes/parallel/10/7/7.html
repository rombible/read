But a like use of "tribes" for the judges sprung from them may be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/78-67.htm" title="Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:">Psalm 78:67-68</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-4.htm" title="However, the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he has chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all Israel:">1Chronicles 28:4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In all the places wherein I have walked;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">in all wherein I continued walking</span>; that is, in all my walking, in all the whole time wherein I have been a wanderer. Instead of <span class="accented">tribes</span>, the Chronicler (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-6.htm">1 Chronicles 17:6</a>) reads "judges," the words in the Hebrew being almost identical. "Judges" is, of course, the more easy and natural reading, but "tribes" gives a fuller sense, and is supported by all the versions. For in the troubled anarchy which lasted until Saul's reign, first one tribe and then another was called to the front, and had a temporary ascendancy; but neither did Jehovah give it any command to provide a settled place for his worship, nor did any one of the judges conceive the thought of making his tribe permanently the chief, by providing a fixed abode for the ark and for God's worship within its borders. <span class="cmt_word">To feed my people Israel.</span> The shepherd, in biblical language, is the ruler, and <span class="accented">to feed</span> is to govern, yet in a kindly way, going in front as the shepherd before his flock, to bear the brunt of danger, to clear the road, and to guide into the safe pastures. So tribe after tribe had been called to bear the brunt of war, and, after winning deliverance, it became its duty to guide and lead the people. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-16.htm">1 Kings 8:16, 18, 25</a>, and still more remarkably in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-8.htm">1 Chronicles 22:8, 9</a>, we find large additions made to the account here given. It follows that we have in this place only a brief summary of the message brought by Nathan, but one containing all the chief points. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:4-17 Blessings are promised to the family and posterity of David. These promises relate to Solomon, David's immediate successor, and the royal line of Judah. But they also relate to Christ, who is often called David and the Son of David. To him God gave all power in heaven and earth, with authority to execute judgment. He was to build the gospel temple, a house for God's name; the spiritual temple of true believers, to be a habitation of God through the Spirit. The establishing of his house, his throne, and his kingdom for ever, can be applied to no other than to Christ and his kingdom: David's house and kingdom long since came to an end. The committing iniquity cannot be applied to the Messiah himself, but to his spiritual seed; true believers have infirmities, for which they must expect to be corrected, though they are not cast off.</body></html>
