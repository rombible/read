<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-10.htm" title="But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.">1Kings 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-12.htm" title="Now therefore come, let me, I pray you, give you counsel, that you may save your own life, and the life of your son Solomon.">1Kings 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-34.htm" title="And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow you with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.">1Kings 1:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-38.htm" title="So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride on king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.">1Kings 1:38</a>). Nathan "the prophet" and Gad "the seer" wrote parts of the history of this and the succeeding reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-29.htm" title="Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,">1Chronicles 29:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-29.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?">2Chronicles 9:29</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Within curtains.</span>--This is the word used in Exodus 26 and 36 for the covering of the tabernacle. The ark was not now within that, but in a similar temporary structure. David's heart is moved by a comparison of his own royal residence with the inferior provision for the ark. Compare the opposite state of things among the returned exiles in <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-10.htm" title="Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit.">Haggai 1:10</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A house of cedar;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">cedars.</span> As these trees were sent by Hiram, and as the house was built, and David now settled in it, some considerable time must have elapsed since his accession. Moreover, the league with Hiram would be the result of David's successes recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1</a>; for the bond of union between the two was their mutual fear of the Philistines. As we have seen before, the alliance with Tyro had a very civilizing effect upon the Hebrews, who were far inferior to the Tyrians in the mechanical arts; and David's house of hewn cedar logs was marvellous in the eyes of a people who still dwelt chiefly in tents. David purposed to build even a more sumptuous palace for Jehovah, and advised with Nathan as his chief counsellor, and the person to whom subsequently the education of Solomon was confided. <span class="cmt_word">Within curtains;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">the curtain</span>; that is, the tent. The tabernacle prepared by Moses for the ark was formed of ten curtains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>), but the significance lay, not in their number, but in the dwelling of Jehovah still being a mere temporary lodging, though his people had received from him a settled land. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-3 David being at rest in his palace, considered how he might best employ his leisure and prosperity in the service of God. He formed a design to build a temple for the ark. Nathan here did not speak as a prophet, but as a godly man, encouraging David by his private judgment. We ought to do all we can to encourage and promote the good purposes and designs of others, and, as we have opportunity, to forward a good work.</body></html>
