Here the verb is plural, because the thought is, "What nation is there whom its gods went to redeem?"<p><span class= "bld">For you.</span>--These words, which can only refer to Israel, seem strange in a prayer to God. They are omitted by the LXX., and changed into <span class= "ital">for them </span>by the Vulg. If they are retained as they are, it must be understood that David for the moment turns in thought to the people, instead of to God whom he is immediately addressing.<p><span class= "bld">For thy land.</span>--The LXX. and the parallel passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-21.htm" title="And what one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make you a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before your people whom you have redeemed out of Egypt?">1Chronicles 17:21</a>), instead of this have, "by driving out." If the text here may be corrected in this way, there will be no occasion for inserting <span class= "ital">from </span>before <span class= "ital">the nations, </span>which is not in the Hebrew. This part of the verse will then read, <span class= "ital">to do great things and terrible, by driving out before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, nations and their gods. </span>The phrase, "great things and terrible," in reference to the Exodus, is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-21.htm" title="He is your praise, and he is your God, that has done for you these great and terrible things, which your eyes have seen.">Deuteronomy 10:21</a>. The whole of this part of the prayer is evidently founded upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-7.htm" title="For what nation is there so great, who has God so near to them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call on him for?">Deuteronomy 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/4-32.htm" title="For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven to the other, whether there has been any such thing as this great thing is, or has been heard like it?">Deuteronomy 4:32-34</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And what one nation,</span> etc.? The translation should be, <span class="accented">And who is like thy people, like Israel, the one nation upon earth which God went to redeem for himself to be his people, and to make for him a name</span>, etc.? Israel both was and remains to this day a nation unique in its history, both in those early dealings of God with it, and also in its later history and its marvellous preservation unto this day. It is remarkable that in this place the word for "God," <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, is followed by a verb plural, the almost invariable rule in Hebrew being that, though <span class="accented">Elohim</span> is itself plural, it takes a verb singular whenever it refers to the true God. In the corresponding passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-21.htm">1 Chronicles 17:21</a>) the verb is in the singular. No adequate reason has been given for this deviation, but probably the usage in these early times was not so strict as it became subsequently. It is the influence of writing, and of the eye becoming conversant with writing, that makes men correct in their use of language and in the spelling of words. In the Syriac Church, God the Word and God the Holy Ghost were at first spoken of in the feminine gender, because "Word" and "Spirit" are both feminine nouns; but grammar soon gave way to soundness of thought and feeling. So probably in colloquial language <span class="accented">Elohim</span> was often used with a verb plural, but correct thinking forbade and overruled grammar. We may regard this, then, as one of the few passages in which the colloquial usage has escaped correction, and attach no further importance to it. <span class="cmt_word">For you.</span> "You" is plural, and refers to the people. The Vulgate has "for them," which is in accordance with the greater exactness of modern grammar. But sudden changes of person are very common in Hebrew, which follows the rules of thought rather than of written composition; and so David speaks of Israel as <span class="accented">you</span>, because they seemed to him to be present. We must note, however, that in the words that follow, <span class="cmt_word">for thy land, and thy people,</span> the pronoun is singular, and refers to God. <span class="cmt_word">From the nations and their gods.</span> Both the Authorized Version and the Revised Version, by inserting "from," which is not in the Hebrew, take "nations" as in apposition with "Egypt;" but a moment's consideration shows that this is untenable, as "nations" is plural. But the whole verse is so full of grammatical difficulties as to make it extremely probable that the text is corrupt, and that we ought to supply the verb "to drive out," which is actually read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-21.htm">1 Chronicles 17:21</a>, or even to substitute it in the place of "for thy land," which is omitted in the parallel passage. The nations which God drove out had nothing to do with Egypt, but were the seven dominant tribes of Canaan; and the bestowal upon Israel of their territories was as essential a part of Jehovah's dealings with his people as the Exodus itself. Thus the reading will be, <span class="accented">To drive out before thy people, whom thou purchasedst for thee from Egypt, nations and their gods.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:18-29 David's prayer is full of the breathings of devout affection toward God. He had low thoughts of his own merits. All we have, must be looked upon as Divine gifts. He speaks very highly and honourably of the Lord's favours to him. Considering what the character and condition of man is, we may be amazed that God should deal with him as he does. The promise of Christ includes all; if the Lord God be ours, what more can we ask, or think of? Eph 3:20. He knows us better than we know ourselves; therefore let us be satisfied with what he has done for us. What can we say more for ourselves in our prayers, than God has said for us in his promises? David ascribes all to the free grace of God. Both the great things He had done for him, and the great things He had made known to him. All was for his word's sake, that is, for the sake of Christ the eternal Word. Many, when they go to pray, have their hearts to seek, but David's heart was found, that is, it was fixed; gathered in from its wanderings, entirely engaged to the duty, and employed in it. That prayer which is from the tongue only, will not please God; it must be found in the heart; that must be lifted up and poured out before God. He builds his faith, and hopes to speed, upon the sureness of God's promise. David prays for the performance of the promise. With God, saying and doing are not two things, as they often are with men; God will do as he hath said. The promises of God are not made to us by name, as to David, but they belong to all who believe in Jesus Christ, and plead them in his name.</body></html>
