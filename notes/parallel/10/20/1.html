He was, to this extent at least, of the same clan with Saul.

So Israel departed to their tents.">1Kings 12:16</a>). It was the signal of revolt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There happened to be there a man of Belial.</span> The fierce words of the men of Judah led to evil results. It was a time when all wise and thoughtful persons would have laboured for peace, and tried to soothe and appease the angry passions fomented by the late war. Instead of this, the men of Judah irritated the Israelites with insult and contumely, and the day, intended as one of rejoicing and of the restoration of David to his throne by common consent, saw the rebellion break forth afresh. Among those who had taken part in the discussion with Judah was Sheba, a man of Belial, that is, a worthless fellow, but possibly possessed of rank and influence; for, according to many commentators, <span class="accented">ben-Bichri</span> does not mean <span class="cmt_word">the son of Bichri,</span> but "a descendant of Becher," the second son of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a>), and possibly the representative of the mishpachah descended from him. But it is remarkable that this son of Benjamin disappears from the genealogies, and that no mishpachah of Bichrites is mentioned either in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38</a> or in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-1.htm">1 Chronicles 8:1</a>. In both places Ashbel, who is enumerated as the third son in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a>, takes the second place. We must be content, therefore, to leave this matter in uncertainty; but evidently Sheba had come with Shimei and Ziba to welcome David back, and, with the rest of the thousand Benjamites, had rushed with loud cries of welcome across the Jordan, and, but for this altercation, would have remained faithful. But tribal jealousies were always ready to break forth, and were a permanent source of weakness; and now, stung by some jibe at Benjamin, Sheba gave orders to a trumpeter to give the signal for the breaking up of the meeting, and, as is commonly the case in large and excited gatherings, the crowd obeyed the unauthorized dictation of one man. His words are contemptuous enough. David is no king, but a private person, and the son, not of a great chief, but of Jesse merely, a yeoman of Bethlehem. <span class="cmt_word">Every man to his tents.</span> "To his tent" meant "to his home" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-17.htm">2 Samuel 18:17</a>). But this withdrawal home signified the rejection of David's government. Almost the same words are used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-3 One trial arises after another for our good, till we reach the place where sin and sorrow are for ever done away. Angry disputers misunderstand or misconstrue one another's words; proud men will have every thing their own way, or wholly refuse their assistance. The favour of the many is not to be depended upon; and what have others to expect, when Hosanna to the Son of David was soon changed to Crucify him, crucify him?</body></html>
