But the term is distinctly explained here as meaning the "six hundred men which came after him from Gath," and called "Gittites" for that reason, a body of men with whom the previous history of David has made us very familiar. They had gathered to him during his outlawry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/22-1.htm" title="David therefore departed there, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.">1Samuel 22:1-2</a>), had been with him at Keilah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-13.htm" title="Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he declined to go forth.">1Samuel 23:13</a>), in the wilderness of Paran (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-13.htm" title="And David said to his men, Gird you on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred stayed by the stuff.">1Samuel 25:13</a>), and at Gath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-3.htm" title="And David dwelled with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.">1Samuel 27:3</a>), "came after him from Gath" to Ziklag, and shared with him in his life and exploits there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-8.htm" title="And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as you go to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.">1Samuel 27:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-2.htm" title="And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rear guard with Achish.">1Samuel 29:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/30-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;">1Samuel 30:1-9</a>), and went up with him to Hebron (2 Samuel 23), and thence to Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-6.htm" title="And the king and his men went to Jerusalem to the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spoke to David, saying, Except you take away the blind and the lame, you shall not come in here: thinking, David cannot come in here.">2Samuel 5:6</a>). They are generally supposed to have afterwards constituted the body of "heroes" or "mighty men," to whom frequent reference is made (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-7.htm" title="And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.">2Samuel 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-6.htm" title="And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.">2Samuel 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-7.htm" title="And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.">2Samuel 20:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-8.htm" title="But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.">1Kings 1:8</a>). The Vatican LXX. here, as often, adds considerably to the text.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the Gittites, air hundred men which came after him from Gath.</span> The Septuagint reads "Gibborim," and without doubt these are the persons meant; but while they were styled Gibborim, the "mighties," for honour's sake, because of their prowess, they probably were popularly called David's Gittites, because they were the six hundred men who had formed his little army when he sought refuge with Achish, King of Gath (l <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-9.htm">1 Samuel 30:9</a>). They were not Philistines, but Israelites of desperate fortune (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>); and it is a proof of David's great ability, and of the moral influence of his character, that he was successful, not only in controlling them and maintaining discipline, but also in forming them into as noble a set of heroes as ever existed, and who were faithful to him in all his fortunes. To their number belonged the thirty-seven champions end-merated in ch. 23, and possibly the title "Gibborim" strictly belonged to them only. As they are still called "the six hundred," it is probable that the corps was maintained at this number by new appointments, and that they had special privileges which made their position very desirable. Certainly David would never forget men who had shared all his fortunes, and been so true and so useful to him; and it is evident, from Hushai's counsel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-8.htm">2 Samuel 17:8</a>), that Absalom feared their resolute valour, and hesitated to attack without overwhelming numbers. Thenius compares these veterans to Napoleon's Old Guard. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:13-23 David determined to quit Jerusalem. He took this resolve, as a penitent submitting to the rod. Before unrighteous Absalom he could justify himself, and stand out; but before the righteous God he must condemn himself, and yield to his judgments. Thus he accepts the punishment of his sin. And good men, when they themselves suffer, are anxious that others should not be led to suffer with them. He compelled none; those whose hearts were with Absalom, to Absalom let them go, and so shall their doom be. Thus Christ enlists none but willing followers. David cannot bear to think that Ittai, a stranger and an exile, a proselyte and a new convert, who ought to be encouraged and made easy, should meet with hard usage. But such value has Ittai for David's wisdom and goodness, that he will not leave him. He is a friend indeed, who loves at all times, and will adhere to us in adversity. Let us cleave to the Son of David, with full purpose of heart, and neither life nor death shall separate us from his love.</body></html>
