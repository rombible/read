For the <span class= "ital">seven hundred </span>here <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-18.htm" title="But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.">1Chronicles 19:18</a> has <span class= "ital">seven thousand, </span>which is almost an incredible number of chariots, and the number here is evidently the more correct; but the same place has forty thousand <span class= "ital">footmen, </span>while here it is forty thousand <span class= "ital">horsemen. </span>Probably both statements are meant to include both infantry and cavalry, though only one of them is especially mentioned in each case. Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-6.htm" title="And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.">2Samuel 10:6</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David slew,</span> etc. (see note on 2 Samuel 8:4). We have seen there that the word translated "chariots" means any vehicle or animal for riding. The numbers here are seven hundred chariots with their charioteers, and forty thousand horsemen; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-4.htm">2 Samuel 8:4</a> we have seventeen hundred horsemen and twenty thousand footmen; finally, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-18.htm">1 Chronicles 19:18</a> we find seven thousand chariots and charioteers, and forty thousand footmen. It is impossible to reconcile these conflicting numbers, but as David had no cavalry, the numbers in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-4.htm">2 Samuel 8:4</a> are the more probable, namely, seventeen hundred cavalry and chariots, and twenty thousand infantry. The Syriac Version gives us here very reasonable numbers, namely, "seven hundred chariots, four thousand cavalry, and much people." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:15-19 Here is a new attempt of the Syrians. Even the baffled cause will make head as long as there is any life in it; the enemies of the Son of David do so. But now the promise made to Abraham, Ge 15:18, and repeated to Joshua, Jos 1:4, that the borders of Israel should extend to the river Euphrates, was performed. Learn hence, that it is dangerous to help those who have God against them; for when they fall, their helpers will fall with them.</body></html>
