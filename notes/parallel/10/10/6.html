It can hardly have been the Rehob (or Beth-rehob) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-21.htm" title="So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, as men come to Hamath.">Numbers 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-28.htm" title="And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lies by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelled therein.">Judges 18:28</a>, since that was near Laish, and within the territory of the Israelites. Some identify it with "Ruhaibeh," twenty-five miles N.E. of Damascus; but it is more likely to have been "Rehoboth by the river" (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>near the Euphrates) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-37.htm" title="And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead.">Genesis 36:37</a>, as this corresponds with "out of Mesopotamia' in the parallel passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-6.htm" title="And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.">1Chronicles 19:6</a>, the situation of which is not more definitely known.<p><span class= "bld">Zoba.</span>--See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-3.htm" title="David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.">2Samuel 8:3</a>.<p><span class= "bld">King Maacah.</span>--Read, <span class= "ital">King of Maacah, </span>as in Chronicles.

It was probably just east of Gilead, between Syria and the land of Ammon; it is not mentioned in Chronicles.<p>The total number of auxiliaries mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-7.htm" title="So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.">1Chronicles 19:7</a>, thirty-two thousand, is the same as given here, Maacah being omitted from the number; but the composition of the force is different. Here only infantry are mentioned, there only chariots and cavalry. It is plain from the result of the battle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-18.htm" title="And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.">2Samuel 10:18</a> in both places) that all three arms of the service were employed; either, therefore, some words have dropped out from both texts, or else the writer in each case did not care to go into details. Chronicles mentions that the allies mustered in Medeba, a place on a hill in the <span class= "ital">Belka </span>plain, about four miles south-east of Heshbon, and well fitted strategically to repel an attack upon Rabbah. It had been originally assigned to the tribe of Reuben (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-9.htm" title="From Aroer, that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the river, and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon;">Joshua 13:9</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they stank</span> (see notes on 1 Samuel 13:4; 27:12). As the Hebrew literally means, <span class="accented">had made themselves stink</span>, the Revised Version rightly translates "had made themselves odious." <span class="cmt_word">The children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians.</span> From <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-6.htm">1 Chronicles 19:6</a> we learn that his mercenaries from Aram cost Hanun a thousand talents of silver, or nearly five hundred thousand pounds - a vast sum, especially considering the great relative value of silver in those days. The mercenaries, moreover, were gathered out of numerous districts of Aram - from Rehob, Zoba, Beth-Maacah, and Tob; the margin being right in rendering "the men of Tob," instead of "Ish-tob." So, too, the Revised Version, "The men of Tob twelve thousand men." It was to this land that Jephthah fled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-3.htm">Judges 11:3</a>). The whole number of the allies was thirty-three thousand, with which total the parallel place agrees, as they are described there as "thirty-two thousand, and the King of Maacah and his people," who are here said to have been a thousand strong. The text, however, there must be corrupt, as it describes them all as horsemen (Authorized Version, "chariots;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a>); here footmen only are mentioned, with which the narrative agrees (see note on ver. 18). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:6-14 They that are at war with the Son of David, not only give the provocation, but begin the war. God has forces to send against those that set his wrath at defiance, Isa 5:19, which will convince them that none ever hardened his heart against God, and prospered. Christ's soldiers should strengthen one another's hands in their spiritual warfare. Let nothing be wanting in us, whatever the success be. When we make conscience of doing our duty, we may, with satisfaction, leave the event with God, assuredly hoping for his salvation in his own way and time.</body></html>
