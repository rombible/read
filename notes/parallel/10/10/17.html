For not only was he possessed of great military genius, but his personal presence would make the men of Israel, a race of sturdy free men, assemble in greater numbers, and would give them confidence. If David himself went there would be no shirking the war and finding excuses to stay at home, and in the camp there would be prompt alacrity and zeal. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:15-19 Here is a new attempt of the Syrians.

Learn hence, that it is dangerous to help those who have God against them; for when they fall, their helpers will fall with them.</body></html>
