And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.">2Samuel 10:17</a>, it is better taken as a proper name here also. It is entirely omitted in Chronicles. Its exact situation is unknown, but from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-3.htm" title="David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.">2Samuel 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-3.htm" title="And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah to Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.">1Chronicles 18:3</a><span class= "ital">, </span>it is plain that it was in the general direction of the Euphrates and not very far from Hamath.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hadarezer</span> (see note on 2 Samuel 8:3). Hadarezer probably had been well content to let his subjects receive the pay of the Ammonites, and extend his empire at their cost. But as paramount king in Aram, the defeat of the mercenaries obliged him to make the war a national affair, and undertake the management of it himself. He therefore summons troops from all the Aramean states on both sides of the Euphrates, and places his own general, Shobach, in command, and makes Helam the place of gathering. <span class="cmt_word">Helam</span>. No such place is known, and the word might mean "their army," in which case the translation would be, "and they came in full force." The Vulgate takes it in this way, but makes the verb the causative singular, and translates, "and he brought their army." On the other hand, the LXX., the Syriac, and the Chaldee make it a proper name here, as even the Vulgate necessarily does in ver. 17, where there can be no doubt. In the parallel place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-16.htm">1 Chronicles 19:16, 17</a>) it is omitted in the first place, and in the second we find in its stead, "upon them." Either, therefore, the chronicler did not know of such a place, or the text is corrupt. Ewald and others suppose that Helam may be identified with Alamata; but we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3</a> that the battle was fought near Hamath, and Alamata is on the Euphrates, too far away for David to have made his attack there. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:15-19 Here is a new attempt of the Syrians. Even the baffled cause will make head as long as there is any life in it; the enemies of the Son of David do so. But now the promise made to Abraham, Ge 15:18, and repeated to Joshua, Jos 1:4, that the borders of Israel should extend to the river Euphrates, was performed. Learn hence, that it is dangerous to help those who have God against them; for when they fall, their helpers will fall with them.</body></html>
