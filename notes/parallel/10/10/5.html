Jericho had been destroyed on the first entrance of the Israelites into Canaan, and a solemn curse pronounced upon whoever "riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho." This curse fell upon Hiel, more than a century after the time of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-34.htm" title="In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun.">1Kings 16:34</a>). But "buildeth" is here, as often, to be understood of "fortifying"; and Jericho, under the name of "the city of palm trees" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm" title="And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelled among the people.">Judges 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-13.htm" title="And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.">Judges 3:13</a>), appears to have been all along an inhabited place.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-5 Nahash had been an enemy to Israel, yet had showed kindness to David. David therefore resolves gratefully to return it. If a Pharisee gives alms in pride, though God will not reward it, yet he that receives the alms ought to return thanks for it. Those who bear ill-will to their neighbours, are resolved not to believe that their neighbours bear any good-will to them. There is nothing so well meant, but it may be ill interpreted, and is wont to be so, by men who love nobody but themselves. The best men must not think it strange if they are thus misrepresented. Charity thinketh no evil. According to the usages of those days and countries, Hanun treated David's ambassadors in the most contemptuous manner. David showed much concern for his servants. Let us learn not to lay unjust reproaches to heart; they will wear off, and turn only to the shame of those who utter or do them; while the reputation wrongfully hurt in a little time grows again, as these beards did.
