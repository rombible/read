Among those whose friendly assistance was conspicuous was "Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon." Hanun, king of the Ammonites, was a son of Nahash, and was conquered by David at Rabbah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-1.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.">2Samuel 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/12-29.htm" title="And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.">2Samuel 12:29-31</a>). It is very possible that after dismantling the royal city David had left a brother of the late king as governor over the conquered territory, and that he now came forward to show his gratitude and faithfulness. It is also possible that Shobi was the son of some Israelite named Nahash, who lived in the conquered city of Rabbah.<p><span class= "bld">Machir the son of Ammiel.</span>--See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-4.htm" title="And the king said to him, Where is he? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.">2Samuel 9:4</a>. David now reaps a reward for his kindness to the crippled son of Jonathan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shobi</span>. It is evident that the most powerful chieftains in Gilead were on David's side, and supported him with men as well as with provisions. Adherents, too, would constantly cross the Jordan, and gather round the old king; and thus, when Absalom arrived, he found himself in face of an army estimated at about twenty thousand men. Among these chiefs it is interesting to find Shobi, son of Nahash, the Ammonite king, and David's friend (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-2.htm">2 Samuel 10:2</a>). When Hanun, the elder son, on succeeding to the throne, brought ruin upon himself by his misconduct to David's ambassadors, Shobi apparently remained faithful to David, and received the grant of a district in Gilead, where he settled with his followers. Some, with less probability, suppose that he had withdrawn to Gilead in the lifetime of his father, to be out of Hanun's way. <span class="cmt_word">Machir</span> was the generous man who had given the crippled son of Jonathan a refuge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-4.htm">2 Samuel 9:4</a>); and David's honourable treatment of Mephibosheth may have won his patron's heart. Of <span class="cmt_word">Barzillai</span>, and his abode, <span class="cmt_word">Rogelim</span>, nothing more is known than what is said here, and in the very interesting narrative in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-31.htm">2 Samuel 19:31</a>, etc. David's lasting gratitude to him is shown by his care for his sons (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-7.htm">1 Kings 2:7</a>). A clan of priests called themselves "the children of Barzillai," and claimed to be the descendants of his daughter. They could not, however, produce their genealogy, and were therefore degraded from the priestly office (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-61.htm">Ezra 2:61-63</a>). Their claim, nevertheless, is a proof that Barzillai was a little king in Gilead, when thus a priestly race thought their alliance with him so honourable as to make them forget that they were of the lineage of Aaron. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:22-29 Ahithophel hanged himself for vexation that his counsel was not followed. That will break a proud man's heart which will not break a humble man's sleep. He thought himself in danger, concluding, that, because his counsel was not followed, Absalom's cause would fail; and to prevent a possible public execution, he does justice upon himself. Thus the breath is stopped, and the head laid low, from which nothing could be expected but mischief. Absalom chased his father. But observe how God sometimes makes up to his people that comfort from strangers, which they are disappointed of in their own families. Our King needs not our help; but he assures us, that what we do for the least of his brethren, who are sick, poor, and destitute, shall be accepted and recompensed as if done to himself</body></html>
