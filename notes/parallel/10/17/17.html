<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-16.htm" title="And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel,">Joshua 18:16</a>). There are two localities which claim to represent it, each of which has its earnest advocates: the "Fountain of the Virgin," on the western slope of the valley of the Kidron; and "Job's Well" just below the junction of the valleys of the Kidron and Hinnom. The latter answers much better to the description in Joshua, but either will suit the present passage. The loyalty of the high priests to David must have been well known, and it would have been quite unsafe for their sons to start from the city itself as bearers of tidings to David; even with all their care they were pursued. Their hiding-place, however, was well chosen. as women resorted to the fountains to draw water, so that communications could be had without attracting observation.<p><span class= "bld">A wench.</span>--<span class= "ital">The maid-servant, </span>the definite article probably indicating some well-known maid of the high priest. The word <span class= "ital">wench </span>is not found elsewhere in the English Bible.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Stayed by En-rogel.</span> The two youths were posted at En-rogel, that is, the "Fuller's spring," near Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-7.htm">Joshua 15:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-9.htm">1 Kings 1:9</a>), and probably the place now known as "Job's Well," situated at the point where the valleys of Jehoshaphat and Hinnom meet. They were placed there because, though they would have been admitted into the city, they would scarcely have been allowed to leave it. Instead of <span class="cmt_word">wench</span> - a term less disrespectful when the Authorized Version was made than it is now <span class="accented">-</span> the Hebrew has <span class="accented">the maidservant.</span> Probably the maid is meant whose usual duty it was to fetch water for domestic purposes, and thus her journey to the well would excite no suspicion. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-21 Here was a wonderful effect of Divine Providence blinding Absalom's mind and influencing his heart, that he could not rest in Ahithophel's counsel, and that he should desire Hushai's advice. But there is no contending with that God who can arm a man against himself, and destroy him by his own mistakes and passions. Ahithophel's former counsel was followed, for God intended to correct David; but his latter counsel was not followed, for God meant not to destroy him. He can overrule all counsels. Whatever wisdom or help any man employs or affords, the success is from God alone, who will not let his people perish.</body></html>
