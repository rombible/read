But his armor bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell on it.">1Samuel 31:4-5</a>, and was evidently invented by the Amalekite to gain favour with David. At the same time, he is careful not to carry the story too far, and asserts that Saul was only put to death at his own request, and after being mortally wounded. However, he must have been one of the first to find the body of Saul after his death, since he brought his crown and bracelet to David--a <span class= "ital">prima facie </span>evidence of the truth of his whole story. The offering of these emblems of royalty shows that the Amalekite recognised David as the future king, a recognition which most of the tribes of Israel were unwilling to make for a long time.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After that he was fallen;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">after his fall</span>; that is, his defeat; for Saul was standing and supporting himself with his spear. <span class="cmt_word">The crown,</span> probably, was a narrow band of gold encircling the royal helmet. <span class="cmt_word">Bracelet</span>.
