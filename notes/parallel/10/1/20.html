In the former David had himself resided (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-10.htm" title="And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.">1Samuel 21:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/27-3.htm" title="And David dwelled with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.">1Samuel 27:3-4</a>), and in the latter was a famous temple of Venus, which was doubtless "the house of Ashtaroth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-10.htm" title="And they put his armor in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.">1Samuel 31:10</a>), where the Philistines put the armour of Saul. "Tell it not in Gath" appears to have become a proverb. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-10.htm" title="Declare you it not at Gath, weep you not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll yourself in the dust.">Micah 1:10</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Lest the daughters of the Philistines.</span>--It was customary for women to celebrate national deliverances and victories (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-21.htm" title="And Miriam answered them, Sing you to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea.">Exodus 15:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-6.htm" title="And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music.">1Samuel 18:6</a>). The word <span class= "ital">uncircumcised </span>might be applied to the heathen generally, but it so happens that, with the exception of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-14.htm" title="And they said to them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach to us:">Genesis 34:14</a>, it is used in the historical books only of the Philistines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-3.htm" title="Then his father and his mother said to him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of your brothers, or among all my people, that you go to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines?

But his armor bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell on it.">1Samuel 31:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-4.htm" title="Then said Saul to his armor bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me.

Askelon.</span> By thus localizing the triumph, and bringing before the mind the thought of multitudes in these well-known places rejoicing with dance and song over the news of their victory, a more affecting picture is produced by the contrast with Israel's distress than could have been effected by mere generalizations. Probably, too, there was present in David's mind the remembrance of scenes which he had witnessed in these towns. In course of time, "Tell it not in Gath" became a proverb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-10.htm">Micah 1:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The daughters.</span> It is the custom in the East for the women to celebrate the prowess of the nation's warriors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-11.htm">Psalm 68:11</a> Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">Uncircumcised</span>. For some unknown reason, this word is used as a term of reproach, especially of the Philistines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-26.htm">1 Samuel 17:26</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:17-27 Kasheth, or the bow, probably was the title of this mournful, funeral song. David does not commend Saul for what he was not; and says nothing of his piety or goodness. Jonathan was a dutiful son, Saul an affectionate father, therefore dear to each other. David had reason to say, that Jonathan's love to him was wonderful. Next to the love between Christ and his people, that affection which springs form it, produces the strongest friendship. The trouble of the Lord's people, and triumphs of his enemies, will always grieve true believers, whatever advantages they may obtain by them.</body></html>
