As Ephraim was near the wilderness of Judah, it was probably the same town as that to which our Lord withdrew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-54.htm">John 11:54</a>). The phrase <span class="cmt_word">beside</span>, literally, <span class="accented">near</span>, Ephraim, shows that it must be the town, and not the tribal territory, which is here meant. <span class="cmt_word">Two full years;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">years of days.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:21-29 Observe the aggravations of Absalom's sin: he would have Ammon slain, when least fit to go out of the world. He engaged his servants in the guilt. Those servants are ill-taught who obey wicked masters, against God's commands. Indulged children always prove crosses to godly parents, whose foolish love leads them to neglect their duty to God.</body></html>
