And David mourned for his son every day.">2Samuel 13:37</a>. Several things were happening at once. When the king's sons fled to the palace, Absalom, taking advantage of the confusion, escaped another way. The reason for mentioning the fact just here is that otherwise he would seem to be included among "the king's sons" of the two following verses.<p><span class= "bld">Behind him</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>from the west, the Oriental always being supposed to face the east in speaking of the points of the compass.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Absalom fled.</span> These words break the form of the narrative, but complete the sense. They briefly state that Jonadab was right; for, so far from molesting any of the rest of the king's sons, Absalom had no other thought than for his own safety. He had avenged his sister, but had at present no other sinister design. It was David's method of treating him which drove this youth, with a nature fit for treachery, into schemes of rebellion. <span class="cmt_word">The way of the hillside behind him.</span> This may mean "from the west," as, in taking the points of the compass, the Hebrews looked to the east, which would thus be "before them." Compare "the backside of the desert," that is, "the western side," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>; and "the Syrians before and the Philistines behind," that is, on the east and west (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-12.htm">Isaiah 9:12</a>). But the versions differ so strangely in their renderings that they could scarcely have been made from our present text. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:30-39 Jonadab was as guilty of Ammon's death, as of his sin; such false friends do they prove, who counsel us to do wickedly. Instead of loathing Absalom as a murderer, David, after a time, longed to go forth to him. This was David's infirmity: God saw something in his heart that made a difference, else we should have thought that he, as much as Eli, honoured his sons more than God.</body></html>
