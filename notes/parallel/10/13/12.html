She first speaks of the sinfulness in Israel of that which was allowed among surrounding heathen, quoting the very words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-7.htm" title="And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had worked folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done.">Genesis 34:7</a>, as if by the traditions of their nation to recall the king's son to a sense of right. She then sets forth the personal consequences to themselves; if he had any love for her he could not wish that shame and contempt should meet her everywhere; and for himself, such an act would make him "as one of the fools in Israel," as one who had cast off the fear of God and the restraints of decency.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Do not force me;</span> literally, <span class="accented">do not humble me.</span> It is to be regretted that the word should be changed, as it bears testimony to the nobleness of the Hebrew women, who regarded their chastity as their crown of honour. The word folly is used in the sense of unchastity in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-7.htm">Genesis 34:7</a> and elsewhere, and it is noteworthy that the Jews thus connected crime with stupidity. Vain, that is, empty persons were the criminal part of the population (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-4.htm">Judges 9:4</a>), and to call a man "a fool" was to attribute to him every possible kind of wickedness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>). The thought which lay at the root of this view of sin was that Israel was a peculiar people, sanctified to God's service; and all unholiness, therefore, was not merely criminal in itself, but a proof that the guilty person was incapable of rightly estimating his privileges. Tamar urges this upon her "empty" brother, and then pathetically dwells upon their mutual shame, and, finding all in vain, she even suggests that the king might permit their marriage. Such marriages, between half-brothers and half-sisters were strictly forbidden, as tending to loosen the bends of family purity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-9.htm">Leviticus 18:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-22.htm">Deuteronomy 27:22</a>); but possibly the Levitical code was occasionally violated, or Tamar may have suggested it in the hope of escaping immediate violence. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-20 From henceforward David was followed with one trouble after another. Adultery and murder were David's sins, the like sins among his children were the beginnings of his punishment: he was too indulgent to his children. Thus David might trace the sins of his children to his own misconduct, which must have made the anguish of the chastisement worse. Let no one ever expect good treatment from those who are capable of attempting their seduction; but it is better to suffer the greatest wrong than to commit the least sin.</body></html>
