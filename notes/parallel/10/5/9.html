Subsequent kings, as Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-27.htm" title="And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.">1Kings 11:27</a>) and Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-5.htm" title="Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.">2Chronicles 32:5</a>), saw its importance and added to its strength. On all other sides Zion was protected by precipitous ravines. There is, however, some difference of opinion about the topography of ancient Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David dwelt in the fort.</span> It was the stronghold or citadel of Zion which David took for his abode; but as he needed space for the dwellings of his mighty men, and for those who would soon flock for trade and security to the capital, David proceeded to fortify the whole of the summit. His works began from "the Millo," rendered "the citadel" by the LXX. Many, deriving the name from a Hebrew root signifying to fill, think that it was a mound, but Nature had herself supplied fit heights for defence, and it is evident that the place was called "the Millo" when David captured the city. We find "Beth-Millo" also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6, 20</a>, where it signifies those who held the citadel of Shechem; and this Mills at Jerusalem was without doubt the old Jebusite keep, and the explanation of its name must be sought in the Jebusite language. As it formed one of the strongest defences of the city, it was rebuilt by Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-24.htm">1 Kings 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a>), and repaired by Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a>) in preparation for the Assyrian attack. Probably it stood at a corner, whence the phrase, "round about from the Millo and inward," or, as it is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-8.htm">1 Chronicles 11:8</a>, "from the Millo inward," that is, starting from. the Millo, the walls enclosed the space behind it. In the parallel place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-8.htm">1 Chronicles 11:8</a>) we find an interesting addition to the narrative, namely, that "Joab repaired the rest of the city." It appears from this that the Jebusites had occupied a good deal of the ground with their habitations, though probably the number of the tribe was not great; or possibly there remained old buildings which were the remains of the Hittite city, and which, being of massive construction, were easily made fit once again for human habitation. We see also proof of Joab's great ability in peace as well as in war. He it was who had captured the stronghold, and it was now his office to arrange the streets and plan of the city, and to assign dwellings to David's mighty men. This would be a work sure to cause jealousy and heart burnings, and no one but Joab, their old commander, could have satisfied them. We find that he assigned to one of them, Uriah the Hittite, a space of ground for a dwelling close to the royal palace. We may suppose, then, that David was now fully reconciled to the "hard sons of Zeruiah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-39.htm">2 Samuel 3:39</a>), and in the stern wars which followed David's election, he needed and had the full benefit of their vigour and ability. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:6-10 The enemies of God's people are often very confident of their own strength, and most secure when their day to fall draws nigh. But the pride and insolence of the Jebusites animated David, and the Lord God of hosts was with him. Thus in the day of God's power, Satan's strong-hold, the human heart, is changed into a habitation of God through the Spirit, and into a throne on which the Son of David rules, and brings every thought into obedience to himself. May He thus come, and claim, and cleanse, each of our hearts; and, destroying every idol, may he reign there for ever!</body></html>
