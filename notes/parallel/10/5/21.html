The statement that David "burned" them is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-12.htm" title="And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.">1Chronicles 14:12</a>, the Hebrew here being simply "took them away." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-5.htm" title="But thus shall you deal with them; you shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They left their images.</span> This is a further proof of the suddenness of the attack, and the completeness of the Philistine discomfiture. For <span class="accented">images</span> we find "gods" in the parallel place in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-12.htm">1 Chronicles 14:12</a>, and the word used here is rendered "idols" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-9.htm">1 Samuel 31:9</a>. As the Philistines supposed that these images of their deities would ensure their victory, they would set great store by them, as the Israelites did by the ark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>), and the French by the oriflamme. Their capture, therefore, was a feat as great as the winning of the eagle of a Roman legion. <span class="cmt_word">David and his men burned them;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">took them away.</span> This translation of the Authorized Version, made to force the words into verbal agreement with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-12.htm">1 Chronicles 14:12</a>, is utterly indefensible; and, like most wrong things, it is absurd. The Bible cannot be improved by frauds, and really the two narratives complete one another. David and his men carried off these images as trophies, just as the Philistines carried off the ark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-11.htm">1 Samuel 4:11</a>). But the ark proved mightier than the Philistine gods, and in terror the people restored it to Israel. But no avenging hand interfered to rescue these gods, and, after being paraded in triumph, they were made into a bonfire. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:17-25 The Philistines considered not that David had the presence of God with him, which Saul had forfeited and lost. The kingdom of the Messiah, as soon as it was set up in the world, was thus attacked by the powers of darkness. The heathen raged, and the kings of the earth set themselves to oppose it; but all in vain, Ps 2:1, etc. The destruction will turn, as this did, upon Satan's own kingdom. David owns dependence on God for victory; and refers himself to the good pleasure of God, Wilt thou do it? The assurance God has given us of victory over our spiritual enemies, should encourage us in our spiritual conflicts. David waited till God moved; he stirred then, but not till then. He was trained up in dependence on God and his providence. God performed his promise, and David failed not to improve his advantages. When the kingdom of the Messiah was to be set up, the apostles, who were to beat down the devil's kingdom, must not attempt any thing till they received the promise of the Spirit; who came with a sound from heaven, as of a rushing, mighty wind, Ac 2:2.</body></html>
