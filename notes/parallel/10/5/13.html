David certainly came perilously near a violation of this law, although he did not, like his son Solomon, take wives and concubines in enormous number for the sake of having a great harem--an important element in the Oriental ideas of regal magnificence. Any possible ambiguity in the phrase "<span class= "ital">out of </span>Jerusalem" is removed by the expression in the parallel place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-3.htm" title="And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.">1Chronicles 14:3</a>), "<span class= "ital">at </span>Jerusalem." Altogether, here and in Chronicles, the names of nineteen sons are mentioned; those of the daughters are not given, although one, Thamar, is mentioned in the story in 2 Samuel 13.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David took him more concubines.</span> Thus with increase of power came also the increased gratification of David's weakness and sin. Well for him would it have been if, like Saul, he had been content with one wife. But this enlargement of his harem was gradual, and the list includes all the sons born at Jerusalem. Of these four, namely, Shammuah, Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon. were his children by Bathsheba (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>, where the names are differently spelt). Besides a variation in the spelling, two sons are mentioned in Chronicles, Nogah and an earlier Eliphelet, whose names are not given here, perhaps because they died young. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-9.htm">1 Chronicles 3:9</a> we learn that only the names of the sons of wives are given in these tables. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:11-16 David's house was not the worse, nor the less fit to be dedicated to God, for being built by the sons of the stranger. It is prophesied of the gospel church, The sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee, Isa 60:10. David's government was rooted and built up. David was established king; so is the Son of David, and all who, through him, are made to our God kings and priests. Never had the nation of Israel appeared so great as it began now to be. Many have the favour and love of God, yet do not perceive it, and so want the comfort of it; but to be exalted to that, and to perceive it, is happiness. David owned it was for his people's sake God had done great things for him; that he might be a blessing to them, and that they might be happy under him.</body></html>
