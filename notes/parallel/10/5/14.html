According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-5.htm" title="And these were born to him in Jerusalem; Shimea, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, four, of Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel:">1Chronicles 3:5</a>, the first four were children of Bathsheba (Bath-shua), and were consequently not born until a later period of David's reign. Solomon and Nathan are the two sons through whom St. Matthew and St. Luke trace our Lord's genealogy. Although Solomon is placed last in all the lists, he appears, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-24.htm" title="And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her: and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.">2Samuel 12:24</a>, to have been the oldest of Bathsheba's sons, and could otherwise hardly have been old enough to take charge of the kingdom at his father's death. The variations in the names are chiefly mere differences of spelling. The first, <span class= "ital">Elishama, </span>in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-6.htm" title="Ibhar also, and Elishama, and Eliphelet,">1Chronicles 3:6</a>, is evidently a copyist's mistake for <span class= "ital">Elishua, </span>since Elishama occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-8.htm" title="And David said on that day, Whoever gets up to the gutter, and smites the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Why they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.">2Samuel 5:8</a>; and the names of Eliphalet and Nogah, given in both lists in Chronicles, are omitted here, probably because they died young, the name of the former being given again to the last son in all the lists. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-9.htm" title="These were all the sons of David, beside the sons of the concubines, and Tamar their sister.">1Chronicles 3:9</a>, it is said that all these were sons of David's wives, besides those of his concubines.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:11-16 David's house was not the worse, nor the less fit to be dedicated to God, for being built by the sons of the stranger. It is prophesied of the gospel church, The sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee, Isa 60:10. David's government was rooted and built up. David was established king; so is the Son of David, and all who, through him, are made to our God kings and priests. Never had the nation of Israel appeared so great as it began now to be. Many have the favour and love of God, yet do not perceive it, and so want the comfort of it; but to be exalted to that, and to perceive it, is happiness. David owned it was for his people's sake God had done great things for him; that he might be a blessing to them, and that they might be happy under him.</body></html>
