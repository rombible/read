Thus, on Saul's appointment, "Samuel wrote in a book the manner of the kingdom" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-25.htm">1 Samuel 10:25</a>, made most emphatic in the Revised Version by the note in the margin, that the Hebrew is "the book"). The revolt against Rehoboam was the result of the too great extension of the royal power in the days of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>). Though subsequently the kings seemed to have retained their supremacy, yet when the good and patriotic Jehoiada restored the family of David to the throne, he reverted to the old ways, and "made a covenant between the king and the people" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17</a>). Besides personal rights, the tribes, accustomed to their own leaders, and unused to yield obedience to a central authority, would certainly stipulate for a large measure of tribal independence, and the management of local matters by themselves. <span class="cmt_word">They anointed David king.</span> This was the public ratification of Samuel's anointing, and by it David became <span class="accented">de facto</span>, as well as <span class="accented">de jure</span>, king. The prophets could not give any right over the people without the consent of the people themselves. But all religious men would see in the Divine command an obligation upon their conscience to accept as their king the man whom the prophet had anointed; and Saul acted in an irreligious manner in seeking to frustrate God's will. And this impiety culminated in his murder of the priests at Nob, which was the open avowal that he would trample all scruples of conscience underfoot. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-5 David was anointed king a third time. His advances were gradual, that his faith might be tried, and that he might gain experience. Thus his kingdom typified that of the Messiah, which was to come to its height by degrees. Thus Jesus became our Brother, took upon him our nature, dwelt in it that he might become our Prince and Saviour: thus the humbled sinner takes encouragement from the endearing relation, applies for his salvation, submits to his authority, and craves his protection.</body></html>
