for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.">1Kings 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-3.htm" title="And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As you did deal with David my father, and did send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.">2Chronicles 2:3</a>),and was still living in the twenty-fourth year of Solomon's reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/9-10.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house,">1Kings 9:10-14</a>; comp. 6:1, 38; 7:1); either, therefore, he must have had a reign of some fifty-seven years, or else his embassy to David must have been some time after the capture of Jerusalem. It is not unlikely that several years may have elapsed between the two events, during which "David went on and grew great" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-10.htm" title="And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.">2Samuel 5:10</a>), thereby attracting the attention and regard of Hiram. But the statement quoted by Josephus from Menander (<span class= "ital">100 Apion, i.</span> 18) cannot be correct, that Hiram reigned only thirty-four years; for David was already in his "house of cedar" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-2.htm" title="That the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains.">2Samuel 7:2</a>) when he formed the purpose of building the Temple, and this was before the birth of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm" title="And when your days be fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, which shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.">2Samuel 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-9.htm" title="Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.">1Chronicles 22:9</a>). Huram's father, however, was also named Huram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-13.htm" title="And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's,">2Chronicles 2:13</a>).<p>The Israelites evidently had little skill in architecture, since they relied on the Ph?nicians for workmen both for this palace and for Solomon's, as well as for the Temple.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hiram King of Tyre.</span> At first sight it seems as if the Hiram who so greatly aided Solomon in the building of the temple was the same person as David's friend (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-10.htm">1 Kings 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-3.htm">2 Chronicles 2:3</a>), but this identification is disproved by the express statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-13.htm">2 Chronicles 2:13</a>, and by the chronology. For granting that this account of Hiram's embassy occurs in a general summary, yet David would not long defer the erection of a palace, and in the history of Bathsheba we find, as a matter of fact, that it was then already built (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2</a>). But as Solomon was grown to manhood at his father's death, David's sin must have been committed not more than nine or ten years after he became king of all Israel. Now, we are told by Josephus ('Contr. Apion,' 1:18), on the authority of Menander of Ephesus, that Hiram reigned in all thirty years. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-10.htm">1 Kings 9:10-13</a> we have an account of a transaction with Hiram in Solomon's twentieth year. In another place ('Ant.,' 8:03. 1) Josephus tells us that Hiram had been King of Tyre eleven years when Solomon, in the fourth year of his reign, began the building of the temple. He would thus have been a contemporary of David for only the last seven or eight years of his reign. But the history of this embassy is given as a proof of David's establishment in his kingdom, and cannot therefore be referred to so late a period in his lifetime, when it would have lost its interest. The improbability of two successive kings having the same name is not, after all, so very great, especially as we do not know what the word <span class="accented">Hiram</span>, or <span class="accented">Haram</span>, exactly means. Nor is Menander's statement conclusive against it, where he says that Hiram's father was named Abibal - "Baal is my father." This would probably be an official name, borne by Hiram as the defender of the national religion, or as a priest king. There is, therefore, no real reason for rejecting the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-13.htm">2 Chronicles 2:13</a> that Hiram, or as he is there called Huram, David's friend, was the father of the Huram who was Solomon's ally. <span class="cmt_word">Cedar trees.</span> Cedar wood was greatly valued both for its fragrance and durability, owing to the resin which it contains preserving it from the attacks of insects. Its colour also is soft and pleasing to the eye, as may be seen in the Jerusalem Chamber in Westminster Abbey, the panels of which are of cedar. It did not grow in the Antilibanus, or eastern part of Lebanon, which belonged to Israel, but only in the western part, which belonged to Tyre. Cedar from the time of David became the favourite material at Jerusalem for the interior of houses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-14.htm">Jeremiah 22:14</a>), and Isaiah charges the people of Samaria with pride for not being content with the native sycomores which had satisfied their fathers, but substituting for it this costly foreign timber (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-10.htm">Isaiah 9:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Carpenters and masons.</span> The necessity of importing "workers of wood, and workers of stone for walls," as the words literally mean, proves how miserable was the social state of Israel in David's time. Though they had been slaves in Egypt, yet at the Exodus the Israelites had men capable of working in the precious metals and jewelry, in weaving and embroidery, in wood carving, and even in the cutting of gems (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-30.htm">Exodus 35:30-35</a>). During the long anarchy of the judges they had degenerated into a race of agricultural drudges, whom the Philistines had debarred from the use of even the simplest tools (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19</a>). Possibly in Saul's time there was a faint restoration of the arts of civilized life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-24.htm">2 Samuel 1:24</a>); but when we find Joab killing Absalom, not with darts, but with pointed stakes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-14.htm">2 Samuel 18:14</a>), the weapons probably of most of the foot soldiers, we see that not much had been done even then in metallurgy; and here earlier in his reign David has to send to Tyre for men who could saw a plank or build a wall. When, then, we call to mind the high state of culture and the magnificence of Solomon's reign, we can form some idea of the vigour with which David raised his subjects from a state of semi-barbarism. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:11-16 David's house was not the worse, nor the less fit to be dedicated to God, for being built by the sons of the stranger. It is prophesied of the gospel church, The sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee, Isa 60:10. David's government was rooted and built up. David was established king; so is the Son of David, and all who, through him, are made to our God kings and priests. Never had the nation of Israel appeared so great as it began now to be. Many have the favour and love of God, yet do not perceive it, and so want the comfort of it; but to be exalted to that, and to perceive it, is happiness. David owned it was for his people's sake God had done great things for him; that he might be a blessing to them, and that they might be happy under him.</body></html>
