<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-10.htm" title="The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;">Joshua 12:10</a>), and the city had been subsequently taken and destroyed by Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/1-7.htm" title="And Adonibezek said, Three score and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.">Judges 1:7-8</a>). It was, however, only partially occupied by the tribes of Judah and Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-21.htm" title="And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.">Judges 1:21</a>; Judges 15:63), and at a later time fell again entirely into the hands of the Jebusites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/19-11.htm" title="And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, Come, I pray you, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.">Judges 19:11-12</a>). That Jebus and Jerusalem were two names of the same city is stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-4.htm" title="And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.">1Chronicles 11:4</a>. This expedition must have taken place immediately after the coronation, since the length of reign over all Israel and of the reign in Jerusalem are said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-5.htm" title="In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.">2Samuel 5:5</a> to be the same. David doubtless saw the importance of at once uniting the tribes in common action as well as the advantages of Jerusalem for his capital (Hebron being much too far southward), and the necessity of dislodging this remnant of the old Canaanites from their strong position in the centre of the land.<p><span class= "bld">Except thou take away.</span>--A better translation is, <span class= "ital">Thou shalt not come hither; but the blind and the lame shall keep thee off. </span>The Jebusites, confident in the natural strength of their fortress, boast that even the lame and the blind could defend it. Their citadel was upon Mount Zion, the highest of the hills of Jerusalem, south-west of the temple hill of Moriah, and surrounded on three sides by deep valleys.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king and his men went to Jerusalem.</span> This expedition took place immediately after David's coronation, and probably he was moved to it by the presence of so large a number of the warriors of Israel. He had long foreseen the arrival of the time when he would be king of all the tribes, and must have debated in his mind the problem of his future capital. He could not remain in Hebron, as it was too far to the south, nor would haughty tribes such as Ephraim have consented to be merged into Judah. On the other hand, he could not move far away, as Judah was his main strength. But living in its neighbourhood, he must often have noticed the remarkable position of the city of Jebus, and admired its rock girt strength (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>). Though the Jebusites had been conquered by Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-3.htm">Joshua 11:3</a>), and Jerusalem captured (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-8.htm">Judges 1:8</a>), yet, as the children of Judah did not occupy it, but "set the city on fire," it seems to have been soon repeopled by its old inhabitants, who there maintained their independence, and, owing to the impregnable nature of its site, could not be treated as Saul treated the Gibeonite inhabitants of Beeroth. Even subsequently, the Jebusite chief who possessed what probably was Mount Moriah, still bore the titular rank of king; for the words in ch. 24:23 literally are, "All this did Araunah the king give unto the king." The explanation of this long independence of the Jebusites is to be found not only in the feebleness of the tribes during the troubled times of the judges, but even mere in the conformation of the site of their stronghold. Jerusalem is situated on the edge of the precipitous wall which forms the western boundary of the valley of the Jordan, and occupies a promontory, on three sides of which are ravines so abrupt and steep that, were it not for their vast depth, they might seem to have been the work of man. On the north side alone it is open to attack, but even there, when the besieger has obtained an entrance, he finds the city divided by another ravine into two parts; whereof the western portion contains the strong citadel of Mount Zion, while the eastern and smaller portion contains the less elevated mountain of Moriah. Though actually raised above the sea level several hundred feet less than Hebron, it seems to the eye more emphatically a mountain-city; and being well nigh encircled by the valleys of Ben-Hinnom and Jehoshaphat, it seems to sit enthroned above the Jordan valley, compared with which it enjoys a cool and refreshing climate. To its inhabitants it was "beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>, Revised Version); to the exiles it was "the city of God," to which their hearts ever turned; to us Christians it is the type of Christ's Church on earth, and of his kingdom in heaven. It was an act worthy of David's genius to foresee the great future of the place, and to inaugurate his kingdom by its capture. We gather from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-45.htm">Ezekiel 16:45</a> that at the time when the Hittites were the dominant race in Syria, Jerusalem was one of their fortresses. The name is a dual, literally <span class="accented">Yerushalaim</span>, and probably the town was so called because it consisted of two parts - the upper and the lower city. <span class="accented">Shalaim</span> means the "two Salems," thus carrying our minds back to the city of Melchizedek (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-2.htm">Psalm 76:2</a> Salem is apparently contrasted with Zion, and so would be the lower town, containing Mount Moriah. Of the other part of the word, <span class="accented">Yeru</span>, numerous derivations are given, of which the only probable one is that which connects it with "Yehovah-yireh" - "God will see to it," the name given to the spot where Abraham on this mountain offered a vicarious sacrifice for his son. We must, however, bear in mind that towns retain the names which they bore in primitive times, and that the name of a Hittite fortress belongs probably to the language of that people. Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither. These words have been a sore puzzle to commentators, and many strange explanations have been given. Rashi says that the <span class="accented">blind</span> meant Isaac, and the <span class="accented">lame</span> Jacob, and that the words referred to an old compact by which Abraham gave Jerusalem to the Jebusites, and that Isaac and Jacob had confirmed this agreement. Unless, then, David was prepared to violate this covenant, he must abstain from the attack. We get no help from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-5.htm">1 Chronicles 11:5</a>, as the words are there omitted, probably because they were not supposed to have any important meaning. The Orientals delighted in dark sayings, and possibly there was here some local reference which the people of Jerusalem would understand, but which is lost for us. But evidently it was a boastful defiance, and may mean that the Jebusites pretended that it would be enough to post only their feeblest men, the blind and the lame, for defense, and that David would try in vain to break through them. <span class="cmt_word">Thinking</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">to say</span>; answering to our phrase "that is" It should be translated, "meaning." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:6-10 The enemies of God's people are often very confident of their own strength, and most secure when their day to fall draws nigh. But the pride and insolence of the Jebusites animated David, and the Lord God of hosts was with him. Thus in the day of God's power, Satan's strong-hold, the human heart, is changed into a habitation of God through the Spirit, and into a throne on which the Son of David rules, and brings every thought into obedience to himself. May He thus come, and claim, and cleanse, each of our hearts; and, destroying every idol, may he reign there for ever!</body></html>
