For David receives full instructions. Taking advantage of the valleys, he is to creep round into the rear of the Philistines, and approach them under cover of a thicket of baca trees. <span class="cmt_word">Mulberry trees;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">baca trees.</span> This suggests the idea that David's place of attack was the Baca valley (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-6.htm">Psalm 84:6</a>), and that there was such a valley, though this is not certain. For the Revised Version translates "valley of weeping," concluding that <span class="accented">baca</span> is not there a proper name. By baca trees the LXX. and Vulgate "pear trees," but as <span class="accented">bacah</span> means "to weep," it is probably some balsamic shrub, from which a resin exudes. The Revised Version puts here in the margin, "balsam trees." Dr. Tristram thinks it was a sort of aspen, but the authority of the Vulgate is great in such matters, as Jerome obtained his information in Palestine itself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:17-25 The Philistines considered not that David had the presence of God with him, which Saul had forfeited and lost. The kingdom of the Messiah, as soon as it was set up in the world, was thus attacked by the powers of darkness. The heathen raged, and the kings of the earth set themselves to oppose it; but all in vain, Ps 2:1, etc. The destruction will turn, as this did, upon Satan's own kingdom. David owns dependence on God for victory; and refers himself to the good pleasure of God, Wilt thou do it? The assurance God has given us of victory over our spiritual enemies, should encourage us in our spiritual conflicts. David waited till God moved; he stirred then, but not till then. He was trained up in dependence on God and his providence. God performed his promise, and David failed not to improve his advantages. When the kingdom of the Messiah was to be set up, the apostles, who were to beat down the devil's kingdom, must not attempt any thing till they received the promise of the Spirit; who came with a sound from heaven, as of a rushing, mighty wind, Ac 2:2.</body></html>
