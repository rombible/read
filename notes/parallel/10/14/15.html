but whether she means this in regard to what she has said of Absalom, or of her own. affairs, is very doubtful. In the former case <span class= "ital">the people </span>would mean the nation generally; in the latter, her own family connections. Certainly in the next verse she returns to her own affairs to keep up the pretence of reality; but here there seems to be an intentional and studied ambiguity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore that I am come,</span> etc. The woman now professes to return to her old story as the reason for her importunity, but she repeats it in so eager and indirect a manner as to indicate that it had another meaning. Instead, too, of thanking the king for fully granting her petition, she still flatters and coaxes as one whose purpose was as yet ungained. The king's word is, <span class="cmt_word">for rest</span> (see margin): it puts an end to vexation, and, by deciding matters, sets the disputants at peace. He is as <span class="cmt_word">an angel of God,</span> as God's messenger, whose words have Divine authority; and his office is, not to <span class="cmt_word">discern</span>, but "to hear the good and the evil," unmoved, as the Vulgate renders it, by blessing and cursing. His mission is too high for him to be influenced either by good words or by evil, but having patiently heard both sides, and calmly thought over the reasons for and against, he will decide righteously. Finally, she ends with the prayer, <span class="cmt_word">And may Jehovah thy God be with thee!</span> By such words she hoped to propitiate the king, who now could not fail to see that the errand of the woman was personal to himself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-20 We may notice here, how this widow pleads God's mercy, and his clemency toward poor guilty sinners.
