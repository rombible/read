Though Absalom subsequently (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-4.htm">2 Samuel 15:4</a>) complained of the lax administration of justice in the realm, yet evidently this woman had the right of bringing her suit before the king; and we may be sure that Joab would take care that nothing unusual was done, lest it should awaken the king's suspicions. But possibly there was a want of method in judicial matters, and very much was left in the hands of the tribal officers, such as we find mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-20 We may notice here, how this widow pleads God's mercy, and his clemency toward poor guilty sinners.
