The LXX. here inserts the statement that she "became the wife of Roboam, the son of Solomon, and bore him a son, Abia." But this is evidently a confused gloss, founded upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-2.htm" title="Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. and his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.">1Kings 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/11-20.htm" title="And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.">2Chronicles 11:20-22</a>. We are there told that Rehoboam's favourite wife was Maachah, the daughter of Absalom, and mother of Abijah; but this must mean that Maachah was his granddaughter through Tamar, since in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-2.htm" title="He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.">2Chronicles 13:2</a> Abijah is called the son of Michaiah, the daughter of Uriel. Tamar then married Uriel, and her daughter became the mother of a line of kings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Three sons.</span> Their names are not given, because they died early (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-18.htm">2 Samuel 18:18</a>). Of his daughter <span class="cmt_word">Tamar</span>, named after her aunt, and, like her, possessed of great beauty, the Septuagint adds that she became the wife of Rehoboam, and mother of Abijah. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a> we are told that Abijah's mother was "Maachah the daughter of Abishalom;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-2.htm">2 Chronicles 13:2</a> that her name was "Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah." We thus gather that Tamar married Uriel, and that it was the granddaughter of Absalom who became Rehoboam's queen. It is strictly in accordance with Hebrew custom to call Absalom's granddaughter his daughter, and, as Uriel was a man of no political importance, he is passed over, as the narrator's object was to show that Abijah's mother was sprung from the handsome and notorious son of David (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-20.htm">2 Chronicles 11:20, 21</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:25-27 Nothing is said of Absalom's wisdom and piety. All here said of him is, that he was very handsome. A poor commendation for a man that had nothing else in him valuable. Many a polluted, deformed soul dwells in a fair and comely body. And we read that he had a very fine head of hair. It was a burden to him, but he would not cut it as long as he could bear the weight. That which feeds and gratifies pride, is not complained of, though uneasy. May the Lord grant us the beauty of holiness, and the adorning of a meek and quiet spirit! Only those who fear God are truly happy.</body></html>
