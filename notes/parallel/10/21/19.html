and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam.">1Chronicles 20:5</a>, reads simply "Jair." It is generally supposed that "oregim(= <span class= "ital">weavers</span>) has accidentally crept into the text from the line below, and "Jai" and "Jaare" are the same with a slight transposition of the letters. Another name for the same person must have been "Dodo," if this Elhanan, as seems altogether probable, is the same with "Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem," one of the thirty-seven heroes, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-24.htm" title="Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,">2Samuel 23:24</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The brother of.</span>--These words, not found in the Hebrew here, are taken from Chronicles, where also the name of the giant, "Lahmi," is given. It is quite possible, however, that the word "Beth-lemite," which is wanting in Chronicles, is a corruption of "Lahmi the brother of." There is a curious Jewish tradition that this Elhanan was David himself, and this has been preserved in the paraphrase of the Chaldee, "and David the son of Jesse, the weaver of veils for the sanctuary, who was of Bethlehem, slew Goliath the Gittite."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Beth-lehemite, slew Goliath the Gittite.</span> The words "the brother of" are inserted by the Authorized Version in order to bring this place into verbal agreement with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>, where we read that "Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite." The Jewish Targum had the same reading as that still found in the text, but regards Elhanan, "God is gracious," as another name for David, and, instead of Jair or Jaare, reads Jesse. Its translation is as follows: "And David the son of Jesse, the weaver of veils for the sanctuary, who was of Bethlehem, slew Goliath the Gittite." Possibly the Authorized Version is right in concluding that the present text is a corruption of that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>. For, first, the repetition of <span class="accented">oregim</span>, "weavers," is suspicious, the Hebrew being, not "weaver's beam," but the plural "weavers' beam," <span class="accented">menor oregim.</span> Next, <span class="accented">Jaare</span> is a transposition of the letters of Jair (in the Hebrew) made probably in order that the compound <span class="accented">Jaare-oregim</span> may obey the rules of Hebrew grammar. More important is it to notice that <span class="accented">Lahmi</span> is part of the word "Bethlehemite" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">Beth-hallahmi</span>), and might thus easily suggest to the eye of a scribe the completion of so well known a word. We must add that among the thirty Gibborim is "Elhanan the son of <span class="accented">Dodo</span> of Bethlehem." Whoever slew Goliath's brother would certainly attain to high rank among the heroes, but if the name <span class="accented">Jair</span> is right, the Elhanan there spoken of is not the person who slew Lahmi. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:15-22 These events seem to have taken place towards the end of David's reign. David fainted, but he did not flee, and God sent help in the time of need. In spiritual conflicts, even strong saints sometimes wax faint; then Satan attacks them furiously; but those who stand their ground and resist him, shall be relieved and made more than conquerors. Death is a Christian's last enemy, and a son of Anak; but through Him that triumphed for us, believers shall be more than conquerors at last, even over that enemy.</body></html>
