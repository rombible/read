and (2) David's choice of victims was directly opposed to such a supposition. He spared, for Jonathan's sake, the only descendants of Saul in the male line, who only could have advanced any claim to the throne, and took (1) the two sons of Rizpah, a concubine of Saul, with whom Abner had committed adultery (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-7.htm" title="And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?">2Samuel 3:7</a>), and (2) five sons of Saul's eldest daughter Merab, who had been promised in marriage to David himself, and then given to another (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/18-17.htm" title="And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give you to wife: only be you valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles. For Saul said, Let not my hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be on him.">1Samuel 18:17-19</a>). The text has <span class= "ital">Michal </span>instead of <span class= "ital">Merab; </span>but this must be an error of the scribe, since it was Merab, not Michal, who was married to "Adriel the Meholathite" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-19.htm" title="But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite to wife.">1Samuel 18:19</a>), and Michal was childless (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-23.htm" title="Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.">2Samuel 6:23</a>). The English phrase "brought up for" is taken from the Chaldee; the Hebrew, as noted in the margin, is <span class= "ital">bare to.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Michal</span>. It was Merab who became the wife of Adriel the Meholathite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-19.htm">1 Samuel 18:19</a>). Michal was childless (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-23.htm">2 Samuel 6:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whom she brought up for.</span> This is one of the many cases of untrustworthiness in the renderings of the Authorized Version. We have noticed a very flagrant instance before in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-21.htm">2 Samuel 5:21</a>. The object of these mistranslations is always the same, namely, to remove some verbal discrepancy in the Hebrew text. The Hebrew says here "five sons of Michal, whom she bare to Adriel;" but Michal never bore a child, therefore something must be substituted which will save the Hebrew from this verbal inaccuracy, and Michal must be represented as having taken Merab's place (perhaps at her death), and been foster mother to her children. This explanation is, it is true, taken from the Jewish Targum; but the Targum never professes to be an exact translation, and constantly perverts the meaning of the plainest passages for preconceived reasons. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-9 Every affliction arises from sin, and should lead us to repent and humble ourselves before God; but some troubles especially show that they are sent to bring sin to remembrance. God's judgments often look a great way back, which requires us to do so, when we are under his rebukes. It is not for us to object against the people's smarting for the sin of their king; perhaps they helped him. Nor against this generation suffering for the sin of the last. God often visits the sins of the fathers upon the children, and he gives no account of any matters. Time does not wear out the guilt of sin; nor can we build hopes of escape upon the delay of judgments. If we cannot understand all the reasons of Providence in this matter, still we have no right to demand that God should acquaint us with those reasons. It must be right, because it is the will of God, and in the end it will be proved to be so. Money is no satisfaction for blood. It should seem, Saul's posterity trod in his steps, for it is called a bloody house. It was the spirit of the family, therefore they are justly reckoned with for his sin, as well as for their own. The Gibeonites did not require this out of malice against Saul or his family. It was not to gratify any revenge, but for the public good. They were put to death at the beginning of harvest; they were thus sacrificed to turn away the wrath of Almighty God, who had withheld the harvest-mercies for some years past, and to obtain his favour in the present harvest. In vain do we expect mercy from God, unless we do justice upon our sins. Executions must not be thought cruel, which are for the public welfare.</body></html>
