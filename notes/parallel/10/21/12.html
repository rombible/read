(For the brave exploit of these men in rescuing the bodies of their king and his sons, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-11.htm">1 Samuel 31:11-13</a>; and for David's generous approval, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-5.htm">2 Samuel 2:5</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:10-14 That a guilty land should enjoy many years of plenty, calls for gratitude; and we need not wonder misused abundance should be punished with scarcity; yet how few are disposed to ask of the Lord concerning the sinful cause, while numbers search for the second causes by which he is pleased to work! But the Lord will plead the cause of those who cannot or will not avenge themselves; and the prayers of the poor are of great power. When God sent rain to water the earth, these bodies were buried, for then it appeared that God was entreated for the land. When justice is done on earth, vengeance from heaven ceases. God is pacified, and is entreated for us through Christ, who was hanged on a tree, and so made a curse for us, to do away our guilt, though he was himself guiltless.</body></html>
