Saul being dead, his male descendants were considered as standing in his place, representing him, and responsible for his acts, just as is largely the case in legal affairs and matters of property at the present day. The number <span class= "ital">seven </span>is, doubtless, fixed upon as being first, a considerable and sufficient number; and then, on account of its sacred associations, and as the representative of completeness.<p><span class= "bld">We will hang them up.</span>--The sons of Saul are only to be given up by David; their actual execution is to be by the Gibeonites, and the method is that of <span class= "ital">hanging </span>or fastening to a stake, either by impaling or by crucifixion, the word being used for both methods of execution.<p><span class= "bld">Unto the Lord</span>--i.e., publicly. (Comp. a similar expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-4.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.">Numbers 25:4</a>.) The sin had been outrageous; its punishment must be conspicuous. The place of execution is fitly chosen in the home of Saul. It seems strange that he should be here spoken of as "the Lord's chosen;" but this and the expression "unto the Lord" go together; what Saul had done he had done as the head of the theocracy, as God's chosen ruler, and now his family must be punished in the presence of Him against whom he had offended--"before the Lord." The idea of regarding the execution of these men as a propitiatory human sacrifice is utterly destitute of any shadow of support.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We will hang them.</span> The punishment indicated here really was impalement, but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-4.htm">Numbers 25:4</a>, where the same verb is used, we find that the criminals were put to death first, and that the impalement was for the purpose of exposing their bodies to view, like the practice a century ago of gibbeting. But the Gibeonites were probably very barbarous, and, when David had delivered the seven lads into their hands, would perhaps wreak upon them a cruel vengeance. <span class="accented">Seven</span> were chosen, because it is the perfect number, with many religious associations; and <span class="cmt_word">unto the Lord</span> means "publicly." So among the Romans <span class="accented">sub Jove</span> meant "in the open air" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-4.htm">Numbers 25:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In Gibeah.</span> This was Saul's native place and home, and was selected by the Gibeonites as the spot where the bodies should be exposed, to add to the humiliation and shame of the fallen dynasty. <span class="cmt_word">Saul, whom the Lord did choose.</span> If this reading is correct, the phrase can only be used as a taunt. But in ver. 9 we find <span class="accented">bahar</span>, "on the hill," instead of <span class="accented">behir</span>, "chosen," and the right reading probably is, "in Gibeah, or, the hill of Jehovah." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-9 Every affliction arises from sin, and should lead us to repent and humble ourselves before God; but some troubles especially show that they are sent to bring sin to remembrance. God's judgments often look a great way back, which requires us to do so, when we are under his rebukes. It is not for us to object against the people's smarting for the sin of their king; perhaps they helped him. Nor against this generation suffering for the sin of the last. God often visits the sins of the fathers upon the children, and he gives no account of any matters. Time does not wear out the guilt of sin; nor can we build hopes of escape upon the delay of judgments. If we cannot understand all the reasons of Providence in this matter, still we have no right to demand that God should acquaint us with those reasons. It must be right, because it is the will of God, and in the end it will be proved to be so. Money is no satisfaction for blood. It should seem, Saul's posterity trod in his steps, for it is called a bloody house. It was the spirit of the family, therefore they are justly reckoned with for his sin, as well as for their own. The Gibeonites did not require this out of malice against Saul or his family. It was not to gratify any revenge, but for the public good. They were put to death at the beginning of harvest; they were thus sacrificed to turn away the wrath of Almighty God, who had withheld the harvest-mercies for some years past, and to obtain his favour in the present harvest. In vain do we expect mercy from God, unless we do justice upon our sins. Executions must not be thought cruel, which are for the public welfare.</body></html>
