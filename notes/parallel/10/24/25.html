It also mentions that when David "offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD," "He answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering." David then fixed upon this as "the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-1.htm" title="Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.">1Chronicles 22:1</a>).<p>Thus, with David's repentance and reconciliation to God after his second great sin closes this narrative and this book.

David purchased the ground to build the altar. God hates robbery for burnt-offering. Those know not what religion is, who chiefly care to make it cheap and easy to themselves, and who are best pleased with that which costs them least pains or money. For what have we our substance, but to honour God with it; and how can it be better bestowed? See the building of the altar, and the offering proper sacrifices upon it. Burnt-offerings to the glory of God's justice; peace-offerings to the glory of his mercy. Christ is our Altar, our Sacrifice; in him alone we may expect to escape his wrath, and to find favour with God. Death is destroying all around, in so many forms, and so suddenly, that it is madness not to expect and prepare for the close of life.</body></html>
