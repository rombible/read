This is probably right as being in harmony with the rest. Three years of famine, three months of defeat, or three days of pestilence. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a> famine, pestilence, and the sword are mentioned as three of God's four sore judgments. But a fourth judgment is there enumerated, namely, that of the increase of wild beasts, and Joshua the Stylite says that in Mesopotamia, as a result of the desolating war between the Romans and Persians, about A.D. , beasts of prey had become so numerous that they entered the villages and carried off the children from the streets, and were so bold and ferocious that even the men scarcely dared go about their labours in the fields (Jos. Styl., edit. Ur., chap. 85). <span class="cmt_word">Now advise, and see;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">now know, and see.</span> The phrase is common in the historical books (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-17.htm">1 Samuel 12:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-38.htm">1 Samuel 14:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-22.htm">1 Samuel 23:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-11.htm">1 Samuel 24:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-17.htm">1 Samuel 25:17</a>, etc.). Our translators render the phrase in a multitude of ways without greatly improving it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:10-15 It is well, when a man has sinned, if he has a heart within to smite him for it. If we confess our sins, we may pray in faith that God would forgive them, and take away, by pardoning mercy, that sin which we cast away by sincere repentance. What we make the matter of our pride, it is just in God to take from us, or make bitter to us, and make it our punishment. This must be such a punishment as the people have a large share in, for though it was David's sin that opened the sluice, the sins of the people all contributed to the flood. In this difficulty, David chose a judgment which came immediately from God, whose mercies he knew to be very great, rather than from men, who would have triumphed in the miseries of Israel, and have been thereby hardened in their idolatry. He chose the pestilence; he and his family would be as much exposed to it as the poorest Israelite; and he would continue for a shorter time under the Divine rebuke, however severe it was. The rapid destruction by the pestilence shows how easily God can bring down the proudest sinners, and how much we owe daily to the Divine patience.</body></html>
