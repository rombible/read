Daniel was still in Jerusalem proper, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the hill of Zion, and it was looking out from thence that he had seen the angel "by the threshing-floor of Araunah," i.e., on the lower hill of Mount Moriah, which afterwards became the site of the Temple, and was included within the city. It was doubtless this event that determined the Temple-site.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go up.</span> David probably, on receiving God's message, had gone to the tent which he had pitched for the ark in Zion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>), in order that he might pray there; and while on his way he saw the dark plague cloud coming as the messenger of God's wrath to smite Jerusalem. In an agony of grief, he poured out his prayer that Jerusalem might be spared, and God heard him, and sent Gad a second time to bid him offer sacrifice, that, by making an atonement, he might stand between the dead and the living, as Aaron had done in the wilderness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-46.htm">Numbers 16:46-48</a>) He is therefore to leave the tabernacle, and mount up to the summit on which Araunah's threshing floor was situated. We read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-28.htm">1 Chronicles 21:28-30</a> that David wished to go to Gibeon, where the Mosaic tabernacle and altar of burnt offering were, to inquire of God, but that he was afraid, as the angel of the pestilence was smiting outside the walls. This is mentioned as an excuse for his offering at an unconsecrated spot. But it also suggests that David's choice was a submission to a chastisement already at work. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:18-25 God's encouraging us to offer to him spiritual sacrifices, is an evidence of his reconciling us to himself. David purchased the ground to build the altar. God hates robbery for burnt-offering. Those know not what religion is, who chiefly care to make it cheap and easy to themselves, and who are best pleased with that which costs them least pains or money. For what have we our substance, but to honour God with it; and how can it be better bestowed? See the building of the altar, and the offering proper sacrifices upon it. Burnt-offerings to the glory of God's justice; peace-offerings to the glory of his mercy. Christ is our Altar, our Sacrifice; in him alone we may expect to escape his wrath, and to find favour with God. Death is destroying all around, in so many forms, and so suddenly, that it is madness not to expect and prepare for the close of life.</body></html>
