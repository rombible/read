The pestilence plainly was not a natural visitation; though possibly the means used was a simoom, or poisonous wind, advancing with terrible rapidity throughout Israel. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord repented.</span> In all the dealings of God's providence, his actions are made to depend upon human conduct. Looked at from above, from God's side, all things are foreknown and immutably fixed; looked at from man's side, all is perpetually changing as man changes. The rescue of Jerusalem as the result of David's penitence and prayers, is thus to human view a change in the counsels and even in the feelings of him who changeth not. <span class="cmt_word">The threshing place.</span> "The threshing floor," as rightly translated in vers. 18, 21, 24. Threshing floors were constructed, whenever possible, on eminences, that the wind might drive the chaff and dust away. Araunah's was on the east of Jerusalem, outside the walls, upon Mount Moriah, and was the site on which the temple was built (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-1.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Araunah</span>. The name is so spelt seven times in vers. 20-24, for which reason the Massorites have substituted it for <span class="accented">Avarnah</span>, found in this verse in the Hebrew text, and for <span class="accented">Aranyah</span> in ver. 18. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21.htm">1 Chronicles 21</a> the name is spelt <span class="accented">Ornan</span>; in the Septuagint in all places, <span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;</span>, <span class="accented">Orna</span>, and in the Syriac, <span class="accented">Oron.</span> The name is, of course, a Jebusite word, and the variation arises from the narrators having written down the sound as it caught their ears. In this, as in many other particulars, it is clear that the chronicler derived his account from independent Sources. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:16,17 Perhaps there was more wickedness, especially more pride, and that was the sin now chastised, in Jerusalem than elsewhere, therefore the hand of the destroyer is stretched out upon that city; but the Lord repented him of the evil, changed not his mind, but his way. In the very place where Abraham was stayed from slaying his son, this angel, by a like countermand, was stayed from destroying Jerusalem. It is for the sake of the great Sacrifice, that our forfeited lives are preserved from the destroying angel. And in David is the spirit of a true shepherd of the people, offering himself as a sacrifice to God, for the salvation of his subjects.</body></html>
