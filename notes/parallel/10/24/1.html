This is a striking instance of attributing directly to God whatever comes about under His permission. And yet it is more than that. God has established immutable spiritual as well as material laws, or rather those laws themselves are but the expression of His unchanging will. Whatever comes about under the operation of those laws is said to be His doing. Now David's numbering the people was the natural consequence of the condition of worldliness and pride into which he had allowed himself to fall. God then moved him, because He had from the first so ordered the laws of the spirit that such a sinful act should be the natural outcome of such a sinful state. Of other interpretations: that which makes the verb impersonal--"one moved"--is hardly tenable grammatically; and that which makes the nominative a sort of compound word--"the wrath of the Lord" (as in some of the ancient versions)--leads to substantially the same explanation as that given above.<p>The word "number" in this verse is a different one from that used in the rest of the chapter, and means simply to <span class= "ital">count, </span>while the other conveys the idea of a military muster.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-9 For the people's sin David was left to act wrong, and in his chastisement they received punishment. This example throws light upon God's government of the world, and furnishes a useful lesson. The pride of David's heart, was his sin in numbering of the people. He thought thereby to appear the more formidable, trusting in an arm of flesh more than he should have done, and though he had written so much of trusting in God only. God judges not of sin as we do. What appears to us harmless, or, at least, but a small offence, may be a great sin in the eye of God, who discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart. Even ungodly men can discern evil tempers and wrong conduct in believers, of which they themselves often remain unconscious. But God seldom allows those whom he loves the pleasures they sinfully covet.</body></html>
