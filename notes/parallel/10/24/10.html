He confesses his sin, and prays for pardon. Still it must be remembered that ten months had passed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-8.htm" title="So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.">2Samuel 24:8</a>) before David saw his sin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David's heart smote him.</span> It appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-24.htm">1 Chronicles 27:24</a> that the census was not completed, and, though Joab had visited Judah, he had not even begun to enrol the names of the men of the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-6.htm">1 Chronicles 21:6</a>). It appears also that the displeasure of God was manifesting itself before David repented (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-7.htm">1 Chronicles 21:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-24.htm">1 Chronicles 27:24</a>). Some sign of this, either in public trouble, or in the brooding of the pestilential miasma over the land, brought home to David's mind the conviction of sin; and he at once humbled himself before God, for the vanity of mind which had engendered in him a wicked lust after martial glory and thirst for bloodshed. <span class="cmt_word">I have done very foolishly</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-13.htm">1 Samuel 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:10-15 It is well, when a man has sinned, if he has a heart within to smite him for it. If we confess our sins, we may pray in faith that God would forgive them, and take away, by pardoning mercy, that sin which we cast away by sincere repentance. What we make the matter of our pride, it is just in God to take from us, or make bitter to us, and make it our punishment. This must be such a punishment as the people have a large share in, for though it was David's sin that opened the sluice, the sins of the people all contributed to the flood. In this difficulty, David chose a judgment which came immediately from God, whose mercies he knew to be very great, rather than from men, who would have triumphed in the miseries of Israel, and have been thereby hardened in their idolatry. He chose the pestilence; he and his family would be as much exposed to it as the poorest Israelite; and he would continue for a shorter time under the Divine rebuke, however severe it was. The rapid destruction by the pestilence shows how easily God can bring down the proudest sinners, and how much we owe daily to the Divine patience.</body></html>
