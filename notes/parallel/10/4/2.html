Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.">Joshua 9:17</a>), and was allotted with the others to the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-25.htm" title="Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,">Joshua 18:25</a>). It is identified with the modern <span class= "ital">El-Bireh, </span>nine miles north of Jerusalem. It is mentioned here, in the past tense, that Beeroth "<span class= "ital">was </span>reckoned to Benjamin," because in the time of the writer it was no longer inhabited. The fact that the murderers of Ish-bosheth were of his own tribe is made prominent.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saul's son had two men captains of bands.</span> The bands mentioned were light-armed troops, used in forays, such as that mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-22.htm">2 Samuel 3:22</a>. Their captains would be men of importance with Ishbosheth, who is here described somewhat contemptuously, not as king, nor by his own name, but as "Saul's son." <span class="cmt_word">Beeroth</span>. This place, literally <span class="accented">the Wells</span>, was one of the four towns reserved for the Gibeonites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>), though nominally belonging to Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-25.htm">Joshua 18:25</a>). The note, that it <span class="cmt_word">was reckoned to Benjamin,</span> suggests that it had until quite lately been occupied by the Canaanites, whose flight to Gittaim had no doubt been caused by Saul's cruel attack upon them referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1, 2</a>. It was thus remarkable that the destruction of Saul's dynasty was the work of the Gibeonites of Beeroth. As we find another of these Beerothites, Naharai, holding the office of armour bearer to Joab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-39.htm">1 Chronicles 11:39</a>), it seems probable that many of them saved themselves from expulsion by becoming soldiers. But among David's worthies a large number were strangers, and some even men of foreign extraction. Beeroth, however, was probably seized in Saul's reign by the Benjamites, by force, and occupied by them, as its citizens returned in large numbers from the exile (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-25.htm">Ezra 2:25</a>), and are counted as genuine Israelites. Moreover, by thus dispossessing the natives, Saul was able to give his tribesmen "fields and vineyards" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-7.htm">1 Samuel 22:7</a>), which otherwise would have been in violation of the Mosaic Law. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-7 See how Ishbosheth was murdered! When those difficulties dispirit us, which should sharpen our endeavours, we betray both our heavenly crowns and our earthly lives. Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty and ruin. The idle soul is an easy prey to the destroyer. We know not when and where death will meet us. When we lie down to sleep, we are not sure that we may not sleep the sleep of death before we awake; nor do we know from what hand the death-blow may come.</body></html>
