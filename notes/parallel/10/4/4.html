Saul had, indeed, sons by a concubine, and grandchildren by his daughter Merab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-8.htm">2 Samuel 21:8</a>). But throughout the history there is no hint that any of these were regarded as the representatives of Saul's house.

When those difficulties dispirit us, which should sharpen our endeavours, we betray both our heavenly crowns and our earthly lives. Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty and ruin. The idle soul is an easy prey to the destroyer. We know not when and where death will meet us. When we lie down to sleep, we are not sure that we may not sleep the sleep of death before we awake; nor do we know from what hand the death-blow may come.</body></html>
