and Shavsha was scribe;">1Chronicles 18:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-6.htm" title="And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.">1Chronicles 24:6</a>; on the other hand, Abiathar is expressly said to be the son of Ahimelech in the narrative in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/22-20.htm" title="And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.">1Samuel 22:20-23</a>. This difficulty is increased by the further notices of the men bearing these names. Ahimelech was certainly the high priest who gave the shew-bread to David, and was slain in consequence by Saul (1 Samuel 21, 22), and Abiathar, who fled to David, and afterwards became high priest, and was finally put out of the high-priesthood by Solomon (1 Kings 1, 2) was certainly his son; but, on the other hand, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-3.htm" title="And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service.">1Chronicles 24:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-6.htm" title="And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.">1Chronicles 24:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-31.htm" title="These likewise cast lots over against their brothers the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brothers.">1Chronicles 24:31</a> Ahimelech. is said to have been the co-priest with Zadok during the reign of David, and our Lord says that David ate the shew-bread "in the days of Abiathar, the high priest" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-26.htm" title="How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the show bread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?">Mark 2:26</a>). These apparently conflicting facts have occasioned unnecessary perplexity. The simple solution of the difficulty seems to be that <span class= "ital">both </span>names were borne alike by father and by son, so that both of them are spoken of sometimes under one name, sometimes under the other.<p>On the double high-priesthood of Zadok and Abiathar, see Note at the beginning of 2 Samuel 6.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Zadok... and Ahimelech... were the priests.</span> We have already seen that this was contrary to the letter of the Mosaic Law, and yet that there was no schism, and that by patience matters came back to the right groove. Zadok, of the elder line of Eleazar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-4.htm">1 Chronicles 6:4-8, 50-53</a>), was high priest at Gibeon, and Ahimelech, of the junior line of Ithamar, was the high priest at Jerusalem. Instead of <span class="accented">Ahimelech the son of Abiathar</span>, the Syriac transposes the names, and reads, "Abiathar the son of Ahimelech" This agrees with the list in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>, and it is certain that Abiathar outlived David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26</a>), and that he was David's high priest throughout his reign, though Zadok is not only constantly associated with him, but is placed first, as the man of higher rank (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-15.htm">2 Samuel 17:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-11.htm">2 Samuel 19:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>). It is also remarkable that our Lord makes Abiathar the person who gave David the shewbread (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-26.htm">Mark 2:26</a>), whereas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21.htm">1 Samuel 21</a>. he is repeatedly called Ahimelech. As both the LXX. and the Vulgate support the Hebrew against the Syriac, and as the reading "Ahimelech" is confirmed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-16.htm">1 Chronicles 18:16</a> and 1 Chron 24:3, 6, 31, we must reject the emendation of the Syriac, and conclude that there was a double tradition respecting these names, some manuscripts making Abiathar the father, and others giving the seniority to Ahimelech. Our Lord made Abiathar the father, but the scribes, in their editing of the Hebrew text, gave that place to Ahimelech, yet did not carry out their restoration so thoroughly as not to leave proof that the names probably ought to be reversed. <span class="cmt_word">Seraiah was scribe.</span> His office was similar to that of a secretary of state with us. For <span class="accented">Seraiah</span> we have <span class="accented">Shavsha</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-16.htm">1 Chronicles 18:16</a>, <span class="accented">Shisha</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-3.htm">1 Kings 4:3</a>, and <span class="accented">Sheva</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>. This illustrates what has just been said as to the uncertainty about proper names. They are always most difficult to read, as the sense gives no aid, and these various forms of a name that does not occur elsewhere really bear witness to the high antiquity of the manuscripts uses by the scribes in settling the text of the Old Testament; and also to their self-restraint in not making them all forcibly agree. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:15-18 David neither did wrong, nor denied or delayed right to any. This speaks his close application to business; also his readiness to admit all addresses and appeals made to him. He had no respect of persons in judgment. Herein he was a type of Christ. To Him let us submit, his friendship let us seek, his service let us count our pleasure, diligently attending to the work he assigns to each of us. David made his sons chief rulers; but all believers, Christ's spiritual seed, are better preferred, for they are made kings and priests to our God, Re 1:6.</body></html>
