(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-6.htm" title="And the LORD said to Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: you shall hamstring their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.">Joshua 11:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-9.htm" title="And Joshua did to them as the LORD bade him: he hamstrung their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.">Joshua 11:9</a>.) This is meant to apply not only to the chariot horses, but to all those of the cavalry. Whether David's reservation of the number needed for 100 chariots was wrong or not, is not said. David probably felt the need of these horses as a means of more rapid communication with the distant parts of his increasing empire; yet this act may have been the entering wedge for Solomon's direct violation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-16.htm" title="But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: for as much as the LORD has said to you, You shall from now on return no more that way.">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>, by sending to Egypt to "multiply horses to himself."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen.</span> The word "chariots" is inserted in the Authorized Version after "thousand," from the parallel place in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-4.htm">1 Chronicles 18:4</a>, where also it is said that David captured seven thousand horsemen. The numbers of the Chronicler are more in proportion to one another than those mentioned here, provided we assume that the word "chariots" ought to be supplied, which, as it is not the only difference, is uncertain. Until the Arabs invented our present system of notation, the ancient methods of representing numbers were so liable to error that little dependence can be placed upon them. The Hebrews used their letters for numerals, but after 400 their system breaks down. Any number higher than 400 can be represented only by long sums in arithmetic, or by an intricate system of points above and below, which were sure to get into confusion. <span class="cmt_word">David houghed all the chariot</span> <span class="cmt_word">horses</span>. There is good reason for concluding that the word used here, <span class="accented">recheb</span>, is a collective, and signifies animals used either for riding or driving. What David reserved was not a hundred chariots, but a hundred riding horses, which would be useful to him for rapid communication, and could scarcely be regarded as a violation of the command in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>. Both the Authorized and Revised Versions are wrong, but the Authorized Version at least makes the word <span class="accented">recheb</span> have the same meaning in both clauses, whereas the Revised Version makes it signify chariot horses in the first clause, and the chariots themselves in the second. The defeat by David, with infantry only, of an army provided with so powerful a force of cavalry and chariots, proves his great military skill, and their capture hears even more emphatic testimony to his generalship. In the Psalms we find horses often referred to as objects regarded with terror, and which gave a great advantage to their enemies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-17.htm">Psalm 33:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-6.htm">Psalm 76:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-10.htm">Psalm 147:10</a>), but over which they had triumphed by Jehovah's aid. This method, however, of rendering them useless, though practised by Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-6.htm">Joshua 11:6</a>), was most cruel; as the poor things, unable to move about with the sinews of their hind legs severed, would perish of hunger. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-8. David subdued the Philistines. They had long been troublesome to Israel. And after the long and frequent struggles the saints have with the powers of darkness, like Israel with the Philistines, the Son of David shall tread them all under foot, and make the saints more than conquerors. He smote the Moabites, and made them tributaries to Israel. Two parts he destroyed, the third part he spared. The line that was to keep alive, though it was but one, is ordered to be a full line. Let the line of mercy be stretched to the utmost. He smote the Syrians. In all these wars David was protected, for this in his psalms he often gives glory to God.</body></html>
