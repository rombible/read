The two names differing in the original only by one very similar letter (the <span class= "ital">d </span>and r, which are so often confused), it might be supposed that one was an error for the other, were it not that both were actually conquered and the spoils of both dedicated by David, Syria is spoken of here because Edom has not yet been mentioned, and the account of its conquest is given afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-14.htm" title="And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants.

It may be, however, that both names were originally in both places.<p><span class= "bld">Amalek.</span>--This is the only allusion to a war with Amalek after David came to the throne. They had been "utterly destroyed" by Saul (1 Samuel 15); but they were a nation of many tribes, and Saul's victory can relate to only one branch, since David afterwards inflicted a severe blow upon them (1 Samuel 30), and there is no reason why still other branches of the nation may not have proved troublesome, and been defeated by him at other times.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of Syria;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">Aram.</span> The reading in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-11.htm">1 Chronicles 18:11</a> is <span class="accented">Edom</span>, which differs from Aram in only one letter. The two words are constantly confused in manuscripts, and "Edom" is probably right here, first, because it is coupled with Moab and Ammon, which were its neighbours; but chiefly because the spoil of Hadarezer, mentioned at the end of the verse, is the spoil of Aram. It would not be enumerated twice. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:9-14 All the precious things David was master of, were dedicated things; they were designed for building the temple. The idols of gold David destroyed, 2Sa 5:21, but the vessels of gold he dedicated. Thus, in the conquest of a soul by the grace of the Son of David, what stands in opposition to God must be destroyed, every lust must be mortified and crucified, but what may glorify him must be dedicated; thus the property of it is altered. God employs his servants in various ways; some, as David, in spiritual battles; others, as Solomon, in spiritual buildings; and one prepares work for the other, that God may have the glory of all.</body></html>
