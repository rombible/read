Our Version inserts the word <span class= "ital">Euphrates </span>on the authority of the margin of the Hebrew, several MSS., and all the ancient versions. <span class= "ital">The </span>river, however, would in any case mean the Euphrates.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hadadezer</span>. The name is spelt Hadarezer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-16.htm">2 Samuel 10:16</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3</a>, and such is the reading of the versions here and of many Hebrew manuscripts. The other reading has been defended on the ground that Hadad is the name of the Syrian sun-god, but the cuneiform inscriptions show that his real name was Hadar. The King of Syria, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-1.htm">1 Kings 20:1</a>, is called in Assyrian Ben-Hidri. <span class="cmt_word">Zobah</span>. Ewald identifies Zobah with the "Sabo" mentioned by Ptolemy. This is uncertain, but evidently Zobah lay northeast of Damascus and south of Hamath, in the region between the rivers Orontes and Euphrates. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a> it appears as a powerless country governed by a multitude of petty kings; but evidently now Hadarezer had made himself supreme, and become a powerful monarch whose authority extended even across the river into Mesopotamia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-16.htm">2 Samuel 10:16</a>). Having crushed his rivals at home, he had next endeavoured to extend his dominion abroad. <span class="cmt_word">As he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.</span> The word "Euphrates" is inserted in the Authorized Version, because the margin says, "Euphrates read but not written." In the Revised Version it is omitted, because the unauthoritative nature of these directions to read something not in the text has been demonstrated. Technically these readings are called <span class="accented">K'ri</span>, and the written text <span class="accented">K'tib.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3</a> the reading is, "as he went to stablish his dominion by the river" - a change which involves the alteration of only one letter, as the word rendered here "his border," and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3</a> "his dominion," is the same, signifying literally, "his hand." For this reason the Revised Version renders it correctly in both places "his dominion." Now, David never had possessed up to this time any dominion upon the Euphrates, but in the fuller narrative in ch. 10. we learn that these Syrians of Zobah had sent powerful reinforcements to the Ammonites in their war with David; and he might reasonably, therefore, determine to follow up his victory over. them by extending his power up to the river, so as to guard the fords, and prevent all future invasions. And this Hadarezer would resent. As an able and enterprising man, he had succeeded in making Zobah a powerful realm, and was not likely to submit to having a bridle put upon his adventurous spirit by the posting of an Israelitish garrison on the borders. We learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-19.htm">2 Samuel 10:19</a> that David's object was to prevent aid coming to Ammon from Zobah, and that he succeeded in putting a barrier in Hadarezer's way. We can scarcely doubt, therefore, that the reading in the Chronicles is to be preferred. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a> we read that Saul had waged war with Zobah, and as David had probably served in it, he would have thereby acquired both a knowledge of the country, very useful in this present more serious expedition, and also have learned the necessity of guarding his dominions against perpetual invasions from that quarter. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-8. David subdued the Philistines. They had long been troublesome to Israel. And after the long and frequent struggles the saints have with the powers of darkness, like Israel with the Philistines, the Son of David shall tread them all under foot, and make the saints more than conquerors. He smote the Moabites, and made them tributaries to Israel. Two parts he destroyed, the third part he spared. The line that was to keep alive, though it was but one, is ordered to be a full line. Let the line of mercy be stretched to the utmost. He smote the Syrians. In all these wars David was protected, for this in his psalms he often gives glory to God.</body></html>
