But the meaning of the words, "the Che-rethites and the Pelethites," has been much disputed. On the one hand it is urged that the form of the name indicates a tribal designation, and that there was a tribe of Cherethites living south of Philistia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-14.htm" title="We made an invasion on the south of the Cherethites, and on the coast which belongs to Judah, and on the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.">1Samuel 30:14</a>), who are also mentioned in connection with the Philistines in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out my hand on the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.">Ezekiel 25:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-5.htm" title="Woe to the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD is against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy you, that there shall be no inhabitant.">Zephaniah 2:5</a>. Besides, these names appear as those of bodies of troops only during the reign of David, and the objection that he would have been unlikely to employ foreign mercenaries may be met by the supposition that they had embraced the religion of Israel. On the other hand, the Chaldee ("archers and slingers<span class= "ital">"</span>) and Syriac ("nobles and Tustics") understood them as appellatives, and it is said that they should properly be translated "executioners and runners," such offices falling to the chief troops in all Oriental armies; no tribe of "Pelethites" is known, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-23.htm" title="Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:">2Samuel 20:23</a> the expression translated "Cherethites and Pelethites" has another form for "Cherethites," which again occurs with "Pelethites" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-4.htm" title="And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and showed them the king's son.">2Kings 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-19.htm" title="And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.">2Kings 11:19</a>, and is translated "the captains and the guard." The question does not seem to admit of positive determination.<p><span class= "bld">Chief rulers.</span>--So these words are rendered in all the ancient versions except the Vulg., and the same term is applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-5.htm" title="And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's friend:">1Kings 4:5</a> to Zabud, with the explanation "the king's friend," and also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-26.htm" title="And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.">2Samuel 20:26</a> to Ira, "a chief ruler about (literally, <span class= "ital">at the side of</span>) David." The word, however (<span class= "ital">cohen</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>is the one generally used for "priest," and there seems here to be a reminiscence in the word of that early time when the chief civil and ecclesiastical offices were united in the head of the family or tribe. Such use of the word had become now almost obsolete, and quite so in the time when the Chronicles were written, since they substitute here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-17.htm" title="And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.">1Chronicles 18:17</a>) "chief about (literally, <span class= "ital">at the hand of</span>) the king." For this change in the use of the word, "exact analogies may be found in ecclesiastical words, as bishop, priest, deacon, minister, and many others."--<span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Cherethites and the Pelethites.</span> As we have already seen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>), the Cherethim were an insignificant tribe inhabiting the southern part of the country of the Philistines. Nor is that place the only proof of this fact; for they are connected with the Philistines also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-5.htm">Zephaniah 2:5</a>. David made their acquaintance when at Ziklag; and probably the Pelethim dwelt in the same neighbourhood, and were a still more unimportant clan or family. Much ingenuity has been expended in finding for their names a Hebrew derivation, and Gesenius explains them as meaning "cutters and runners," though for the latter signification he has to go to the Arabic, where he finds a verb <span class="accented">falata</span>, "to run away," "flee." But this craze of explaining the names of aboriginal tribes and their towns by Hebrew words is not only absurd in itself, but bars the way to sounder knowledge. For it is possible that, by the study of names not belonging to the Hebrew language, we might arrive at some correct ideas about the races who had previously occupied Palestine. Instead of this, the whole system of derivation is corrupted, and philology made ridiculous. What can be more ludicrous than to explain these Pelethim as "runners away," unless it be the notion that the Rephaim took their name from the Hebrew word for "a ghost"? In his "mighties" David had a powerful bodyguard of native Israelites, and Saul previously had formed a similar force of three thousand men, not merely for the protection of his own person, but to guard the land from marauding incursions of Amalekites and other freebooting tribes. Such a body of men was of primary importance for police purposes and the safety of the frontiers. How useful such a force would be we can well understand from the history of the marches between England and Scotland (see also note on 2 Samuel 3:22); but I imagine that the Cherethites and Pelethites were used for humbler purposes. While "the mighties" guarded the frontiers, and kept the peace of the kingdom, these men would be used about the court and in Jerusalem, to execute the commands of the king and his great officers. Native Israelites would refuse such servile work, and the conquered Canaanites might become dangerous if trained and armed; while these foreigners, like the Swiss Guard in France, would be trustworthy and efficient. As for the true-born Israelites, they probably did not form the mass of the population, but, like the Franks in France, were the privileged and dominant race. We read that even from Egypt, besides their own dependents, there went up with Israel "a great mixture" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>, margin). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4</a> these are even contemptuously designated by a word which answers to our "omnium gatherum;" yet even they, after the conquest of Palestine, would be higher in rank than the subjugated Canaanites, from whom, together with another "mixed multitude" spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-3.htm">Nehemiah 13:3</a>, are descended the felahin of the present day. David's armies would be drawn from the Israelites, among whom were now reckoned the mixed multitude which went up from Egypt, and which was ennobled by taking part in the conquest of Canaan. In the army "the mighties" would hold the chief place; while the mercenaries, recruited from Ziklag and its neighbourhood, which continued to be David's private property (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-6.htm">1 Samuel 27:6</a>), would be most useful in the discharge of all kinds of administrative duty, and would also guard the king's person. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-23.htm">2 Samuel 20:23</a> for <span class="accented">Cherethi</span> we find <span class="accented">Cheri</span>, which word also occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4, 19</a>. In the former passage the spelling is a mistake, the letter <span class="accented">t</span> having dropped out, and it is so regarded by the Jews, who read "Cherethi." The versions also translate there just as they do here, namely the Vulgate and LXX., "Cherethi and Pelethi;" and the Syriac by two nouns of somewhat similar sound to the Hebrew, and which signify "freemen and soldiers." In the latter place in Kings it is probable that some other tribe supplied the bodyguard in Queen Athaliah's time. <span class="cmt_word">David's sons were chief rulers;</span> Hebrew and Revised Version, <span class="accented">priests</span>. Similarly, in ch. 20:26, "Ira the Jairite was David's priest," Hebrew, <span class="accented">cohen</span>; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-5.htm">1 Kings 4:5</a>, "Zabud was Solomon's priest." Gesenius and others suppose that they were domestic chaplains, not ministering according to the Levitical law, but invested with a sort of sacerdotal sacredness in honour of their birth. But if we look again at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-5.htm">1 Kings 4:5</a> we find "Zabud was priest, the king's friend;" and the latter words seem to be an explanation of the title <span class="accented">cohen</span>, added because the word in this sense was already becoming obsolete. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-17.htm">1 Chronicles 18:17</a> the language is completely changed, and we read, "and David's sons were chief at the king's hand." We may feel sure that the Chronicler knew what was the meaning of the phrase in the Books of Samuel, and that he was also aware that it had gone out of use, and therefore gave instead the right sense. Evidently the word cohen had at first a wider significance, and meant a "minister and confidant." He was the officer who stood next to his master, and knew his purpose and saw to its execution. And this was the meaning of the term when applied to the confidential minister of Jehovah, whose duty it was to execute his will according to the commands given in the Law; but when so used it gradually became too sacred for ordinary employment. Still, there is a divinity about a king, and so his confidants and the officers nearest to his person were still called cohens; and we find the phrase lingering on for another century and a half. For Jehu puts to death, not only Ahab's great men and kinsfolk, but also "his cohens," the men who had been his intimate friends (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-11.htm">2 Kings 10:11</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:15-18 David neither did wrong, nor denied or delayed right to any. This speaks his close application to business; also his readiness to admit all addresses and appeals made to him. He had no respect of persons in judgment. Herein he was a type of Christ. To Him let us submit, his friendship let us seek, his service let us count our pleasure, diligently attending to the work he assigns to each of us. David made his sons chief rulers; but all believers, Christ's spiritual seed, are better preferred, for they are made kings and priests to our God, Re 1:6.</body></html>
