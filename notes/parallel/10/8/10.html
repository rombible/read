(for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.">1Chronicles 18:10</a>. Joram is probably the Jewish form of the same name. An embassy headed by the king's son was an especially honourable one. The occasion was David's conquest of Toi's neighbour and constant enemy, and the large presents sent by him have something of the character of tribute. The phrase "to bless him," is simply equivalent to "congratulate him," by which the same word is translated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-10.htm" title="He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.">1Chronicles 18:10</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Joram</span>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-10.htm">1 Chronicles 18:10</a> he is called Hadoram, and this was apparently his real name, Joram being merely the substitution of the nearest Hebrew word for something foreign and therefore unintelligible. So among the descendants of the French refugees settled in England similar changes are common. Thus Pillons becomes Pillow; Chevallier, Shoveller; St. Amour, Stammers. As Hamath bordered upon Zobah, and apparently had waged unsuccessful war with the vigorous Hadarezer, Tel was grateful to David for smiting his rival, and sent this embassy of congratulation for the purpose of ensuring the conqueror's friendship. For this end he also sent rich presents; and as a present is called in the Hebrew a <span class="accented">blessing</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-27.htm">1 Samuel 25:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-26.htm">1 Samuel 30:26</a>, margin), the phrase used here, to bless him, contains the idea, not only of congratulation, but of offerings. There is something admirable in this high Oriental courtesy. The material value of the gifts is left in the background. Their worth lies in their being the acknowledgment of the Divine favour resting upon David, and in the prayer that that favour may continue. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-43.htm">Psalm 18:43, 44</a> we have proof of the great pleasure which this embassy from so great a nation gave to David. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:9-14 All the precious things David was master of, were dedicated things; they were designed for building the temple. The idols of gold David destroyed, 2Sa 5:21, but the vessels of gold he dedicated. Thus, in the conquest of a soul by the grace of the Son of David, what stands in opposition to God must be destroyed, every lust must be mortified and crucified, but what may glorify him must be dedicated; thus the property of it is altered. God employs his servants in various ways; some, as David, in spiritual battles; others, as Solomon, in spiritual buildings; and one prepares work for the other, that God may have the glory of all.</body></html>
