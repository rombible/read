the text here has Dodai, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-4.htm" title="And over the course of the second month was Dodai an Ahohite, and of his course was Mikloth also the ruler: in his course likewise were twenty and four thousand.">1Chronicles 27:4</a>, where he is mentioned as the general for the second month. The name is the same under slightly differing forms. "Ahohite" is a patronymic derived from Ahoah, son of Bela, Benjamin's son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-4.htm" title="And Abishua, and Naaman, and Ahoah,">1Chronicles 8:4</a>).<p><span class= "bld">When they defied . . . there gathered.</span>--The words "there gathered" require the mention of some place, and the construction of the word for "defied" is unusual. The parallel passage in Chronicles reads, "He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines," &c. The difference between the two readings is not great in the original, and the latter is better. Pas-dammim is the Ephes-dammim of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-1.htm" title="Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongs to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.">1Samuel 17:1</a>, where Goliath defied the armies of Israel, and was slain by David.<p><span class= "bld">Were gone away</span>--Rather, were <span class= "ital">gathered </span>to battle. So it is translated in the LXX., Vulg., and Syriac, and so the Hebrew requires. The error is a curious one, and seems to have arisen in this way: In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-13.htm" title="He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.">1Chronicles 11:13</a> the mention of the battle in which Shammah was engaged (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-11.htm" title="And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentils: and the people fled from the Philistines.">2Samuel 23:11</a>) is altogether omitted, and the expression "the people fled from before the Philistines" therefore becomes connected with this battle. Josephus follows that text, and our translators were probably misled by him. Several lines have dropped out from the text in Chronicles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Dodo</span>. The Hebrew has <span class="accented">Dodai</span>, and "Dodo" is a mere correction of the Massorites to bring the name into verbal agreement with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-12.htm">1 Chronicles 11:12</a>; but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-4.htm">1 Chronicles 27:4</a> he is called <span class="accented">Dodai</span>, and we there find him in command of the second division of the army. For "Dodai," however, we ought to read there "Eleazar the son of Dodai." <span class="cmt_word">Ahohite</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">the son of an Ahohite</span>, and probably a member of the family descended from Ahoah, a son of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-4.htm">1 Chronicles 8:4</a>). He would thus belong to the most warlike tribe of Israel, though not mentioned among the Benjamites who joined David at Ziklag (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-1.htm">1 Chronicles 12:1-7</a>). He joined him, apparently, at an earlier date. That <span class="cmt_word">were there gathered together.</span> The word "there" implies the previous mention of some place, and though the text in the parallel passage in Chronicles is more corrupt than that before us, it has, nevertheless, preserved the name of the spot where the encounter took place. In Chronicles the name of Shammah is omitted, and his achievement is mixed up in a strange fashion with that of Eleazar. Here the two heroes have each his separate record, and it is only on minor matters that the text there is more correct. Restored from the readings in Chronicles, the narrative is as follows: "He was with David at Pas-dammim, and the Philistines were gathered there to battle, and the men of Israel were gone up: and he stood (that is, made a stand) and smote," etc. <span class="accented">Pas-dammim</span> is called <span class="accented">Ephes-dammim</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-1.htm">1 Samuel 17:1</a>. It was situated in the valley of Elah, and, as being upon the border, was the scene of numerous conflicts, whence its name, "the boundary of blood." It was there that David slew Goliath. <span class="cmt_word">Were gone away;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">went up</span>; that is, to battle. The idea that the Israelites had fled is taken from the parallel place in Chronicles, where, however, it refers to Shammah's exploit. In vers. 9 and 11 there, the phrase, "the Philistines were gathered together," occurs twice, and the scribe, having accidentally omitted the intervening words, has confused together the exploits of Eleazar and Shammah. In this battle Eleazar withstood the Philistine onset, and smote them till his hand clave to his sword hilt. Many such instances of cramp are recorded, and Mr. Kirkpatrick, in his commentary, quotes one in which the muscles of a warrior's hand could be relaxed, after hard fighting, only by fomentations of hot water. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:8-39 David once earnestly longed for the water at the well of Bethlehem. It seems to be an instance of weakness. He was thirsty; with the water of that well he had often refreshed himself when a youth, and it was without due thought that he desired it. Were his valiant men so forward to expose themselves, upon the least hint of their prince's mind, and so eager to please him, and shall not we long to approve ourselves to our Lord Jesus, by ready compliance with his will, as shown us by his word, Spirit, and providence? But David poured out the water as a drink-offering to the Lord. Thus he would cross his own foolish fancy, and punish himself for indulging it, and show that he had sober thoughts to correct his rash ones, and knew how to deny himself. Did David look upon that water as very precious which was got at the hazard of these men's blood, and shall not we much more value those benefits for purchasing which our blessed Saviour shed his blood? Let all beware of neglecting so great salvation.</body></html>
