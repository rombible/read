The list in Chronicles is given in connection with David's becoming king over all Israel; but in both cases the list is not to be understood as belonging precisely to any definite time, but rather as a catalogue of the chief heroes who distinguished themselves at any time in the life of David.<p><span class= "bld">The Tachmonite that sat in the seat.</span>--The text of this verse has undergone several alterations, which may be corrected by the parallel passage in Chronicles. This clause should read, "Jashobeam the Hachmonite," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm" title="And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.">1Chronicles 11:11</a>. Jashobeam came to David at Ziklag (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-1.htm" title="Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they were among the mighty men, helpers of the war.">1Chronicles 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-6.htm" title="Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korhites,">1Chronicles 12:6</a>), and afterwards became the general of the first division of the army (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-2.htm" title="Over the first course for the first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.">1Chronicles 27:2</a>), being immediately followed by Dodo. One of the same family was tutor to David's sons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-32.htm" title="Also Jonathan David's uncle was a counselor, a wise man, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king's sons:">1Chronicles 27:32</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The captains.</span>--The word for <span class= "ital">captain </span>and the word for <span class= "ital">three </span>are much alike, and the text here and in Chronicles perpetually fluctuates between the two. Probably the sense here is that Jashobeam was the chief of the three who stood highest in rank among the heroes.<p>No mention is made in either list of Joab, because, as commander-in-chief, he stood in a rank by himself.<p><span class= "bld">The same was Adino the Eznite.</span>--It is difficult to attach any meaning to these words in their connection, and they are generally considered as a corruption of the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm" title="And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.">1Chronicles 11:11</a>, "he lifted up his spear," which are required and are inserted here in the English. For "eight hundred" Chronicles has "three hundred," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-18.htm" title="And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.">2Samuel 23:18</a>. Variations in numbers are exceedingly common, but the probability is in favour of the correctness of the text here. This large number was slain by Jashobeam and the men under his command in one combat.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These be the names.</span> A similar list is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-10.htm">1 Chronicles 11:10-47</a>, with several variations, and sixteen more names. It is given there in connection with David's elevation to the throne of all Israel, and the conquest of Jerusalem. Such catalogues might possibly be revised from time to time, and new names inserted as there were vacancies caused by death. And this seems to have been the case with the list in Chronicles, which contains the names of all who were admitted during David's reign into the order of the mighties. The present is the actual list of the order as it existed on the day when David, at Hebron, was anointed king over all the twelve tribes. And we can well conceive that, on so grand an occasion, David founded this, the first order of chivalry, and gave his thirty knights, as they would be now called, their special rank and high privileges. <span class="cmt_word">The Tachmonite.</span> This verse is extremely corrupt. A man could not be a Tachmonite and an Eznite at the same time. In the Revised Version the corruption is confessed in the mildest terms, but there is something painfully ludicrous in giving Josheb-basshebeth as the man's name. The reading "Jashobeam the son of a Hachmonite," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>, is confirmed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-6.htm">1 Chronicles 12:6</a>, where Jashobeam is mentioned among those who joined David at Ziklag, and by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-2.htm">1 Chronicles 27:2</a>, where we find him appointed commander of the first brigade of twenty-four thousand men. The error in the present text arose from the scribe's eye being misled by catching sight of <span class="accented">basshebeth</span> in the line above, it being the word translated "in the same place" in the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_word">He Adino the Eznite.</span> These unmeaning words are a corruption of the right reading preserved in Chronicles, "he lifted up his spear." The number of men whom he slew at one time is there stated as having been three hundred; but, as Abishai accomplished this feat, and yet held only inferior rank, eight hundred is probably right. And possibly it is not meant that he slew them all with his own hand, though that is quite possible. He was <span class="cmt_word">chief of the captains.</span> The word for "captain," <span class="accented">shalish</span>, is derived from the numeral "three;" and probably it was the title of the three who formed the first rank of the mighties. But in course of time it seems to have been applied to the commanders of the body guard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-25.htm">2 Kings 10:25</a>); and we find Bidcar so styled when in personal attendance upon Jehu (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-25.htm">2 Kings 9:25</a>); and Pekah used the opportunities afforded by this office for the murder of Pekahiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-25.htm">2 Kings 15:25</a>). It is not used of military officers generally. Those admitted to the list were evidently the outlaws . who had been with David in his wanderings and at Ziklag. They now received their reward, and became, moreover, the stay of David's throne. It is their past history which accounts for the strange composition of the list. A large number came from Judah, and especially from Bethlehem. Several are David's own relatives. Seven towns or families furnish sixteen out of the whole list. We find a father and his son, and pairs of brothers. There are, moreover, numerous foreigners - Hittites, Ammonites, Moabites, a Syrian from Zobah, and Gideonites, descended from the aboriginal inhabitants of the land. Such a list would have been sorely resented had it not been formed out of men who had earned it by their past services and their fidelity to David. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:8-39 David once earnestly longed for the water at the well of Bethlehem. It seems to be an instance of weakness. He was thirsty; with the water of that well he had often refreshed himself when a youth, and it was without due thought that he desired it. Were his valiant men so forward to expose themselves, upon the least hint of their prince's mind, and so eager to please him, and shall not we long to approve ourselves to our Lord Jesus, by ready compliance with his will, as shown us by his word, Spirit, and providence? But David poured out the water as a drink-offering to the Lord. Thus he would cross his own foolish fancy, and punish himself for indulging it, and show that he had sober thoughts to correct his rash ones, and knew how to deny himself. Did David look upon that water as very precious which was got at the hazard of these men's blood, and shall not we much more value those benefits for purchasing which our blessed Saviour shed his blood? Let all beware of neglecting so great salvation.</body></html>
