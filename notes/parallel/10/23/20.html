The meaning of the description given of him there is disputed; but probably it should be translated, "Benaiah the son of Jehoiada the priest, as head," that is, of the brigade. He was thus the son of the Jehoiada who was leader of the house of Aaron, and whose coming to Hebron with three thousand seven hundred martial priests did so much to make David king of all Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-27.htm">1 Chronicles 12:27</a>). Subsequently he took the side of Solomon against Adonijah, and was rewarded by being made commander-in-chief, in place of Joab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-35.htm">1 Kings 2:35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Kabzeel</span>. An unidentified place in the south of Judah, on the Edomite border (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21</a>), called <span class="accented">Jekabzeel</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-25.htm">Nehemiah 11:25</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Two lionlike men of Moab.</span> The Septuagint reads, "the two sons of Ariel of Moab." which the Revised Version adopts. "Ariel" means "lion of God," and is a name given to Jerusalem in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1, 2</a>. The Syriac supports the Authorized Version in understanding by the term "heroes," or "champions;" but the use of poetical language in a prosaic catalogue is so strange that the Septuagint is probably right. If so, Ariel is the proper name of the King of Moab and the achievement took place in the war recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">A lion.</span> This achievement would be as gratefully remembered as the killing of a man eating tiger by the natives in India. A lion, driven by the cold from the forests, had made its lair in a dry tank near some town, and thence preyed upon the inhabitants as they went in and out of the city. And Benaiah had pity upon them, and came to the rescue, and went down into the pit, and, at the risk of his life, slew the lion. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:8-39 David once earnestly longed for the water at the well of Bethlehem. It seems to be an instance of weakness. He was thirsty; with the water of that well he had often refreshed himself when a youth, and it was without due thought that he desired it. Were his valiant men so forward to expose themselves, upon the least hint of their prince's mind, and so eager to please him, and shall not we long to approve ourselves to our Lord Jesus, by ready compliance with his will, as shown us by his word, Spirit, and providence? But David poured out the water as a drink-offering to the Lord. Thus he would cross his own foolish fancy, and punish himself for indulging it, and show that he had sober thoughts to correct his rash ones, and knew how to deny himself. Did David look upon that water as very precious which was got at the hazard of these men's blood, and shall not we much more value those benefits for purchasing which our blessed Saviour shed his blood? Let all beware of neglecting so great salvation.</body></html>
