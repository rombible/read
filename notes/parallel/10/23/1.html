The word "said," used twice, is a peculiar form (used between two hundred and three hundred times) of direct Divine utterances, and applied to human sayings only here, in the places referred to in Numbers, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-1.htm" title="The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spoke to Ithiel, even to Ithiel and Ucal,">Proverbs 30:1</a>, in all which special claim is made to inspiration.<p><span class= "bld">The sweet psalmist of Israel.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">He that is pleasant in Israel's psalms, i.e., </span>by the composition and arrangement of Israel's liturgical songs he was entitled to be called "pleasant." David, with life now closing, fitly sends down this prophetic song to posterity with such description of its human writer as should secure to it authority.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now these be the last words of David.</span> A long interval separates this psalm from the preceding. The one was written when David had just reached the zenith of his power, and, when still unstained by foul crime, he could claim God's favour as due to his innocence. These last words were David's latest inspired utterance, written, probably, towards the end of the calm period which followed upon his restoration to his throne, and when time and the sense of God's renewed favour had healed the wounds of his soul. <span class="cmt_word">David the son of Jesse said.</span> It was probably this account of the author, and its personal character, which caused the exclusion of this hymn from the Book of Psalms. It seemed to belong rather to David's private history than to a collection made for use in the public services of the temple. <span class="cmt_word">Said</span>. The word is one usually applied to a message coming directly from God. It is used, however, four times in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24.htm">Numbers 24</a>. of the words of Balaam, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30.htm">Proverbs 30</a>. of those of Agur. The solemnity of the word indicates the fatness of its inspiration. <span class="cmt_word">The sweet psalmist;</span> literally, <span class="accented">he who is pleasant in the psalms of Israel.</span> David might well claim this title, as, under God, we owe the Psalter to him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-7 These words of David are very worthy of regard. Let those who have had long experience of God's goodness, and the pleasantness of heavenly wisdom, when they come to finish their course, bear their testimony to the truth of the promise. David avows his Divine inspiration, that the Spirit of God spake by him. He, and other holy men, spake and wrote as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. In many things he had his own neglect and wrong conduct to blame. But David comforted himself that the Lord had made with him an everlasting covenant. By this he principally intended the covenant of mercy and peace, which the Lord made with him as a sinner, who believed in the promised Saviour, who embraced the promised blessing, who yielded up himself to the Lord, to be his redeemed servant. Believers shall for ever enjoy covenant blessings; and God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, shall be for ever glorified in their salvation. Thus pardon, righteousness, grace, and eternal life, are secured as the gift of God through Jesus Christ. There is an infinite fulness of grace and all blessings treasured up in Christ, for those who seek his salvation. This covenant was all David's salvation, he so well knew the holy law of God and the extent of his own sinfulness, that he perceived what was needful for his own case in this salvation. It was therefore all his desire. In comparison, all earthly objects lost their attractions; he was willing to give them up, or to die and leave them, that he might enjoy full happiness, Ps 73:24-28. Still the power of evil, and the weakness of his faith, hope, and love, were his grief and burden. Doubtless he would have allowed that his own slackness and want of care were the cause; but the hope that he should soon be made perfect in glory, encouraged him in his dying moments.</body></html>
