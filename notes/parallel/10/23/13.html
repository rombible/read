"The thirty" seems to have been a common name for this band of heroes (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/23-23.htm" title="He was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard.">2Samuel 23:23-24</a>, &c), who were perhaps originally exactly thirty, but whose number varied from time to time, being here given (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-39.htm" title="Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.">2Samuel 23:39</a>) as thirty-seven.<p><span class= "bld">In the harvest time.</span>--"The preposition does not mean <span class= "ital">in, </span>and the reading in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-15.htm" title="Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.">1Chronicles 11:15</a> 'to the rock' is perhaps the true one" (<span class= "ital">Kirkpatrick</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>On "the valley of Rephaim," see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-18.htm" title="The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.">2Samuel 5:18</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And three.</span> The Hebrew text has "thirty," for which both the Authorized Version and the Revised Version silently substitute "three," as is correctly given in Chronicles. The absence of the article shows that these three were not Jashobeam, Eleazar, and Shammah, but probably Abishai, Be-naiah, and another whose name and exploits have been purposely omitted both here and in Chronicles. Apparently this narrative, so interesting as showing the fascination which David exercised over his men, is given as having led to the institution of this second order of three in the brotherhood of the mighties. <span class="cmt_word">In the harvest time.</span> The Hebrew is "to harvest," but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-15.htm">1 Chronicles 11:15</a> "to the rock." As the preposition used here cannot mean "in," this is probably the right reading. In this case, also, it is the similarity of the words that has led to the con. fusion. Is it possible that these lists were taken from very old and worn catalogues, which it was very difficult to decipher? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:8-39 David once earnestly longed for the water at the well of Bethlehem. It seems to be an instance of weakness. He was thirsty; with the water of that well he had often refreshed himself when a youth, and it was without due thought that he desired it. Were his valiant men so forward to expose themselves, upon the least hint of their prince's mind, and so eager to please him, and shall not we long to approve ourselves to our Lord Jesus, by ready compliance with his will, as shown us by his word, Spirit, and providence? But David poured out the water as a drink-offering to the Lord. Thus he would cross his own foolish fancy, and punish himself for indulging it, and show that he had sober thoughts to correct his rash ones, and knew how to deny himself. Did David look upon that water as very precious which was got at the hazard of these men's blood, and shall not we much more value those benefits for purchasing which our blessed Saviour shed his blood? Let all beware of neglecting so great salvation.</body></html>
