The variation, however, mast have been ancient, since the LXX. combines the two.<p><span class= "bld">Cornets.</span>--This word occurs only here, and is thought from its etymology to mean some kind of metal instrument with bells or rings, which gave forth its sound on being shaken. The Vulg. translates <span class= "ital">sistra. </span>Instead of it Chronicles has "trumpets."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Played</span>. The word does not mean "played on a musical instrument," but "danced and rejoiced." <span class="cmt_word">On all manner... of fir wood.</span> The Hebrew literally is, <span class="accented">with all cypress woods.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-8.htm">1 Chronicles 13:8</a> we find "with all their might, even with songs," etc. Gesenius, in his 'History of the Hebrew Language,' describes this as a mere guess at a misunderstood text, and Maurer ridicules it as a stupid emendation. More sensibly Thenius regards it as the right reading, and the words here as a corruption of it, caused by some scribe misspelling the words, which are nearly identical. In our version the ambiguous meaning of the word "played" makes the passage less startling. For "they danced with all cypress woods" is unintelligible. The musical instruments mentioned here are the harp, Hebrew <span class="accented">chinnor</span>, a guitar; the psaltery, Hebrew <span class="accented">nebel</span>, a kind of <span class="cmt_word">harp</span> of a triangular shape, with the point downwards; the <span class="cmt_word">timbrel</span>, Hebrew <span class="accented">tof</span>, a tambourine or small drum; the <span class="cmt_word">cornet</span>, Hebrew <span class="accented">mena'na'</span>, a bar on which were a number of loose metal rings, which were shaken in time to the music, but others think that "castanets" are meant, which are pieces of wood beaten in time. The Revised Version adopts this rendering. And finally <span class="cmt_word">cymbals</span>. For "cornets" we find in the parallel place "trumpets," whence the translators of the Authorized Version took their rendering; but the Hebrew word means "things to shake." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-5 God is present with the souls of his people, when they want the outward tokens of his presence; but now David is settled in the throne, the honour of the ark begins to revive. Let us learn hence, to think and to speak highly of God; and to think and speak honourably of holy ordinances, which are to us as the ark was unto Israel, the tokens of God's presence, Mt 28:20. Christ is our Ark; in and by him God manifests his favour, and accepts our prayers and praises. The ark especially typified Christ and his mediation, in which the name of Jehovah and all his glories are displayed. The priests should have carried the ark upon their shoulders. Philistines may carry the ark in a cart without suffering for it; but if Israelites do so, it is at their peril, because this was not what God appointed.</body></html>
