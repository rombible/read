In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-9.htm" title="And the border was drawn from the top of the hill to the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjathjearim:">Joshua 15:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-6.htm" title="And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up there the ark of God the LORD, that dwells between the cherubim, whose name is called on it.">1Chronicles 13:6</a>, Baale is said to be another name for Kirjath-jearim. This was the place to which the ark was carried after its removal from Bethshemesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-2.htm" title="And it came to pass, while the ark stayed in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.">1Samuel 7:2</a>), and it had remained here ever since. It has been generally identified with <span class= "ital">Kuryet-el-enab, </span>about eight miles a little north of west from Jerusalem. More recent opinion places it at <span class= "ital">'Erma, </span>about eleven miles a little south of west from Jerusalem, and four miles east of Bethshemesh. In either case it was three or four hours' march from the capital.<p><span class= "bld">Whose name is called.</span>--Neither the text nor the margin of the English represents the original quite accurately. Translate, <span class= "ital">which is called by the name, the name of Jehovah of hosts. </span>The ark is thus described as being the visible symbol of God's presence and of His covenant with His people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From Baale of Judah.</span> We learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-9.htm">Joshua 15:9, 60</a> that Baalah, or Kirjath-Baal, "the city of Baal," was the old Canaanite name of Kirjath-jearim, the "city of woods." It lay about eight miles westward from Jerusalem (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-21.htm">1 Samuel 6:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1, 2</a>). The preposition "from" is very startling, as really David went <span class="accented">to</span> Baale. Yet all the versions have it, but they put on Baale an incorrect meaning. Baal means "lord," "master," and they render, "David went with all the people that were with him <span class="accented">from</span> [or, <span class="accented">of</span>] the citizens of Judah," understanding by "master" a householder, one who was master of a family. The real explanation probably is that the narrator wrote according to the sense, and not according to the grammar. The thought in his mind was the bringing up of the ark from its long resting place, and not the prior physical necessity of going down to the place where it was. <span class="cmt_word">With all the people.</span> David had consulted with "the captains of thousands and hundreds, and every leader" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-1.htm">1 Chronicles 13:1</a>), and it was with their good will that he drew the ark of God out of its long concealment. A select body of these nobles, or sheiks, would accompany the king, while the rest, with their attendants, would be posted along the eight miles of road. <span class="cmt_word">Whose name is called by the name.</span> In the Hebrew, the word "name" is twice repeated, the words literally being, <span class="accented">the ark of Elohim, whereon is called the Name, the Name of Jehovah of Sabaoth.</span> Most of the versions omit the second <span class="accented">Name</span>, and the translators of the Authorized Version also felt it to be a difficulty, which they have tried to escape by inserting words between the two. Really it is a most interesting sign of the existence at this early date of a special reverence for the name "with four consonants" which we call "Jehovah." Subsequently it was never pronounced, but the word "Lord" was read instead, in the Revised Version, the importance of the passage is well brought out by the first Name being written with a capital, of the use of which the Revisers are very chary. With their usual inconsecutiveness, they retain Lord for <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>, though this is "the Name," and though they have restored the word <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> in several less important places. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-5 God is present with the souls of his people, when they want the outward tokens of his presence; but now David is settled in the throne, the honour of the ark begins to revive. Let us learn hence, to think and to speak highly of God; and to think and speak honourably of holy ordinances, which are to us as the ark was unto Israel, the tokens of God's presence, Mt 28:20. Christ is our Ark; in and by him God manifests his favour, and accepts our prayers and praises. The ark especially typified Christ and his mediation, in which the name of Jehovah and all his glories are displayed. The priests should have carried the ark upon their shoulders. Philistines may carry the ark in a cart without suffering for it; but if Israelites do so, it is at their peril, because this was not what God appointed.</body></html>
