Moreover, it is said of the Obed-edom of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/26-4.htm" title="Moreover the sons of Obededom were, Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth, and Nethaneel the fifth.">1Chronicles 26:4-5</a>, that "God blessed him," which seems to refer to this passage. The name, although a singular one (<span class= "ital">servant of Edom</span>) was not uncommon, and was also borne by one having charge of the vessels of the sanctuary in the days of King Amaziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-24.htm" title="And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.">2Chronicles 25:24</a>). The Obed-edoms of David's time were porters of the Tabernacle, Levitical musicians, and took an active part in bringing the ark to Jerusalem, and afterwards in ministering before it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-16.htm" title="And David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers to be the singers with instruments of music, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.">1Chronicles 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-18.htm" title="And with them their brothers of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.">1Chronicles 15:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-21.htm" title="And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.">1Chronicles 15:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-24.htm" title="And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.">1Chronicles 15:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/16-4.htm" title="And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:">1Chronicles 16:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/16-37.htm" title="So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brothers, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required:">1Chronicles 16:37-38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-1.htm" title="Concerning the divisions of the porters: Of the Korhites was Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.">1Chronicles 26:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-4.htm" title="Moreover the sons of Obededom were, Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth, and Nethaneel the fifth.">1Chronicles 26:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/26-13.htm" title="And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according to the house of their fathers, for every gate.">1Chronicles 26:13-15</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Obed-Edom.</span> We find two Levites of this name among David's officials - one belonging to the family of Merari, a singer and doorkeeper for the ark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-18.htm">1 Chronicles 15:18, 21, 24</a>); the other of the family of Korah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-4.htm">1 Chronicles 26:4, 5</a>). And as it is there said that "God blessed him," he probably it was into whose house the ark was taken. He is called a Gittite, because he belonged to Gath-Rimmon, a Levitical city in the tribe of Dan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-45.htm">Joshua 19:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-24.htm">Joshua 21:24</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:6-11 Uzzah was struck dead for touching the ark. God saw presumption and irreverence in Uzzah's heart. Familiarity, even with that which is most awful, is apt to breed contempt. If it were so great a crime for one to lay hold on the ark of the covenant who had no right to do so, what is it for those to lay claim to the privileges of the covenant that come not up to the terms of it? Obed-edom opened his doors without fear, knowing the ark was a savour of death unto death to those only who treated it wrong. The same hand that punished Uzzah's proud presumption, rewarded Obed-edom's humble boldness. Let none think the worse of the gospel for the judgments on those that reject it, but consider the blessings it brings to all who receive it. Let masters of families be encouraged to keep up religion in their families. It is good to live in a family that entertains the ark, for all about it will fare the better.</body></html>
