So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.">2Samuel 10:14</a>. Joab had spent the winter or rainy season at Jerusalem; now he returns to Ammon. David had evidently hurried his campaign against Hadarezer to prevent the junction of his foes, and Joab had probably been sent at first with only a small force to hold the Ammonites in check. With the speedy and successful close of David's own operations, he returned to Jerusalem, while the bulk of the army was sent to join Joab. By the curious insertion of a letter the Hebrew text reads "when angels (<span class= "ital">or </span>messengers) go forth." It is corrected in the margin.<p><span class= "bld">Destroyed the children.</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.">1Chronicles 20:1</a>, explains "wasted the country of the children." After the custom of ancient warfare, while the army was besieging Rabbah, foraging parties were sent out to lay waste the country and cut off any stragglers. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/13-17.htm" title="And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shual:">1Samuel 13:17-18</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After the year was expired;</span> Hebrew and Revised Version, <span class="accented">at the return of the year</span>; that is, as Josephus paraphrases it, "the next spring." It seems quite certain that the war with Hadarezer did not take place in the same year as the defeat of the Syrians at Medeba. For the gathering of his mercenaries by Nahash would occupy a long time, and it was done so leisurely, that not only did news of it reach Jerusalem, but David was able to collect his forces, and instead of awaiting the invasion, could deliver his attack on the enemy's ground. The battle at Medeba took place in the autumn, and, as it was impossible to keep the field with winter so near, Joab marched back to Jerusalem, intending in the spring to return to the siege of Rabbah. But David quickly had information that a more serious war was impending, and, instead of sending Joab, he now gathers "all Israel," and, after gaining a victory, it is plain that he marched into the Syrian territories, and compelled by his presence the allies of Hadarezer to transfer their allegiance to him. Simultaneously with this war he had to meet the attack of the Edomites, for which purpose he detached Abishai with a portion of his army; and it was necessary also to post garrisons in their country, and in Atom of Damascus. It was while he was thus occupied in the Aramean states that he gathered the "much brass" spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-8.htm">2 Samuel 8:8</a>. The Ammonites would necessarily be left to themselves while these great events were going on, but now, after a respite of a year and a half, David <span class="cmt_word">sent Joab, and his servants,</span> that is, his officers - the word "servant" in Oriental courts being constantly used to designate those, high in rank near the king's person - <span class="cmt_word">and all Israel;</span> that is, an army gathered from all the tribes. In accordance with the cruel customs of ancient warfare, they began by laying the whole country waste, and putting all whom they found to the sword, and thus <span class="cmt_word">destroyed the children of Ammon</span> before laying siege to the capital, into which all the people by these harsh measures had been forced to go for refuge. In the Hebrew there is a curious spelling, the word "kings" being written <span class="accented">melakim</span>, with an <span class="accented">aleph</span> to represent the long a. It is a mistake to suppose that a different word, <span class="accented">malakim</span>, "angels" or "ambassadors," is meant, as it is nothing more than an archaic method of spelling, instances of which have been made rare by the extreme fastidiousness of Hebrew scribes. There is, however, another example not far off, where the Hebrew word for "poor" is also written with an inserted <span class="accented">aleph.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-5 Observe the occasions of David's sin; what led to it. 1. Neglect of his business. He tarried at Jerusalem. When we are out of the way of our duty, we are in temptation. 2. Love of ease: idleness gives great advantage to the tempter. 3. A wandering eye. He had not, like Job, made a covenant with his eyes, or, at this time, he had forgotten it. And observe the steps of the sin. See how the way of sin is down-hill; when men begin to do evil, they cannot soon stop. Observe the aggravations of the sin. How could David rebuke or punish that in others, of which he was conscious that he himself was guilty?</body></html>
