Having been the cause of his murder, she is careful to make for him the customary mourning. How long it lasted is uncertain. The mourning for Aaron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-29.htm">Numbers 20:29</a>) and that for Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-8.htm">Deuteronomy 34:8</a>) were each for thirty days; while that for Jacob at Atad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-10.htm">Genesis 50:10</a>) and that of the men of Jabesh-Gilead for Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-13.htm">1 Samuel 31:13</a>) lasted only for seven days. Both these, however, were under such exceptional circumstances as made them no rule; but in Ecclus. 22:12 we read, "Seven days do men mourn for him that is dead," and the national lamentation for Judith lasted the same time (Judith 16:24). Probably, however, the mourning of a widow for her husband would last a month. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:14-27 Adulteries often occasion murders, and one wickedness is sought to be covered by another. The beginnings of sin are much to be dreaded; for who knows where they will end? Can a real believer ever tread this path? Can such a person be indeed a child of God? Though grace be not lost in such an awful case, the assurance and consolation of it must be suspended. All David's life, spirituality, and comfort in religion, we may be sure were lost. No man in such a case can have evidence to be satisfied that he is a believer. The higher a man's confidence is, who has sunk in wickedness, the greater his presumption and hypocrisy. Let not any one who resembles David in nothing but his transgressions, bolster up his confidence with this example. Let him follow David in his humiliation, repentance, and his other eminent graces, before he thinks himself only a backslider, and not a hypocrite. Let no opposer of the truth say, These are the fruits of faith! No; they are the effects of corrupt nature. Let us all watch against the beginnings of self-indulgence, and keep at the utmost distance from all evil. But with the Lord there is mercy and plenteous redemption. He will cast out no humble, penitent believer; nor will he suffer Satan to pluck his sheep out of his hand. Yet the Lord will recover his people, in such a way as will mark his abhorrence of their crimes, to hinder all who regard his word from abusing the encouragements of his mercy.</body></html>
