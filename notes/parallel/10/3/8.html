for he could scarcely have expected Ishbosheth to endure quietly what at least was a great insult. But probably the question, <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?</span> does not mean a mild expostulation on the king's part, but the purpose to degrade Abner and strip him of his office. Probably after the defeat by Joab at Gibeon, the army was less satisfied with its leader, and his detractors may gladly have encouraged the king to use this opportunity for bringing Abner down to his proper place. Weak kings often try to play the strong man; but the attempt here only drove the imperious soldier to put the matter to the proof, and show that the strength was his. We know that David groaned all his life through under Joab's iron will, and, though he tried, yet that he never succeeded in throwing off the yoke. But Joab never behaved unfaithfully to his sovereign as Abner did here, and his crimes were deeds of violence committed in David's cause. <span class="cmt_word">Am I a dog's head, which against Judah, etc.?</span> The words literally are, <span class="accented">Am I a dog's head that is for Judah?</span> and are rightly rendered in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">Am I a dog's head that belongeth to Judah?</span> Am I at once worthless and a traitor, a thing of no account, and on the side of thy enemies? In the words that follow he protests, not so much his innocence as his great deserts. <span class="cmt_word">This day</span> - that is, at this very time - <span class="cmt_word">I am showing kindness unto the house of Saul... and this day thou wouldest visit upon me</span> - that is, punish me for - <span class="cmt_word">the fault about this woman.</span> I make and maintain thee as king, and thou wouldst play the king upon me, the kingmaker! <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:7-21 Many, like Abner, are not above committing base crimes, who are too proud to bear reproof, or even the suspicion of being guilty. While men go on in sin, and apparently without concern, they are often conscious that they are fighting against God. Many mean to serve their own purposes; and will betray those who trust them, when they can get any advantage. Yet the Lord serves his own designs, even by those who are thus actuated by revenge, ambition, or lust; but as they intend not to honour him, in the end they will be thrown aside with contempt. There was real generosity both to Michal and to the memory of Saul, in David's receiving the former, remembering probably how once he owed his life to her affection, and knowing that she was separated from him partly by her father's authority. Let no man set his heart on that which he is not entitled to. If any disagreement has separated husband and wife, as they expect the blessing of God, let them be reconciled, and live together in love.</body></html>
