The Midrash explains Chileab as meaning "Quite like the father." He is called Daniel in the parallel genealogy in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-1.htm">1 Chronicles 3:1</a>, and this was probably his real name, and Chileab a name of affection. He must have died young, for Adonijah appears as David's eldest son after the death of Amnon and Absalom; and it is thus natural that he should still be known by the name he bore as a child. <span class="cmt_word">Geshur</span>. The word signifies "Bridgeland," and is the name of two districts, one of which formed the northern part of the tribe of Manasseh, and extended on both sides of the Jordan, from the little Hermon to the sea of Gennesareth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-5.htm">Joshua 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-13.htm">Joshua 13:13</a>). The other was in Syria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-8.htm">2 Samuel 15:8</a>), and probably was situated upon some river, though its exact position is not yet known. Talmai, its king, now gave his daughter to be one of David's wives, and though he was probably only a petty prince, still it is a proof of David's growing power that a potentate living at so great a distance was willing to make an alliance with him. Of the other wives and their sons nothing is known except of Adonijah, who inherited, on the death of Absalom, the dangerous position of firstborn; and who, after trying to make his rights good, was put to death by Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-25.htm">1 Kings 2:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As Eglah is especially called David's wife,</span> the Jewish interpreters hold that she was the highest in rank in his household, and therefore identical with Michal, who was restored to David while at Hebron. But she was childless; and more probably the words are to be taken as simply closing the narrative, and as belonging, therefore, equally to each of the six. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 The length of this war tried the faith and patience of David, and made his settlement at last the more welcome. The contest between grace and corruption in the hearts of believers, may fitly be compared to this warfare. There is a long war between them, the flesh lusting against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; but as the work of holiness is carried on, corruption, like the house of Saul, grows weaker and weaker; while grace, like the house of David, grows stronger and stronger.</body></html>
