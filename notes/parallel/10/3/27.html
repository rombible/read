he then took him "aside" to some place of privacy, as the LXX. reads, "by the side of the gate." On the phrase "fifth rib," see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-23.htm" title="However, he refused to turn aside: why Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.">2Samuel 2:23</a>. The reason for this cold-blooded and treacherous murder on the part of Joab is expressly said to be "for the blood of Asahel his brother;" but no doubt his revenge was quickened by jealousy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Joab took him aside in the gate.</span> As we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-24.htm">2 Samuel 18:24</a> of David sitting "between the two gates," and of "the roof over the gate," and in ver. 33 of "the chamber over the gate," Ewald's idea of there being a roofed inner space, with a guard room over it, as in the mediaeval gate towers in German towns, is probably right. As the "two gates" would make the space between them gloomy, the spot would just suit Joab's purpose. He meets Abner, therefore, in a friendly manner, and drawing him aside, as if to converse with him apart from the people going in and out, there assassinates him. The place was so public that the deed must have been witnessed by multitudes, though the gloom, felt the more by them from the contrast with the bright glare of sunshine outside, had given Joab the opportunity of drawing his sword without Abner's observing it. <span class="cmt_word">For the blood of Asahel his brother.</span> Joab's act was in accordance with Oriental feeling; and the duties of the avenger of blood might with some straining be made to cover his retaliation for an act done by Abner in self-defence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-26.htm">Numbers 35:26, 27</a>). It is remarkable that Hebron was itself a city of refuge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>), and this may have led Joab to murder him in the gate, before he had actually entered. Still, Abner did not expect any such retribution, and supposing that Joab knew of the purpose that had brought him to Hebron, he could not suppose that he would be so indifferent to his master's interests as to put a summary stop to the negotiations for uniting the tribes under David. As it was, this deed brought upon David an evil name, and four or five years had to elapse before the tribes could be induced to take him for their king. Even then his hold over them was far less than it would otherwise have been; for though the shock was gradually got over, yet the suspicion still dung to him. And if the deed was Joab's own act, still David had contributed to it by underhand dealings. His very fear of Joab had caused him to wrong his able general, and given him just cause for resentment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:22-39 Judgments are prepared for such scorners as Abner; but Joab, in what he did, acted wickedly. David laid Abner's murder deeply to heart, and in many ways expressed his detestation of it. The guilt of blood brings a curse upon families: if men do not avenge it, God will. It is a sad thing to die like a fool, as they do that any way shorten their own days, and those who make no provision for another world. Who would be fond of power, when a man may have the name of it, and must be accountable for it, yet is hampered in the use of it? David ought to have done his duty, and then trusted God with the issue. Carnal policy spared Joab. The Son of David may long delay, but never fails to punish impenitent sinners. He who now reigns upon the throne of David, has a kingdom of a nobler kind. Whatever He doeth, is noticed by all his willing people, and is pleasing to them.</body></html>
