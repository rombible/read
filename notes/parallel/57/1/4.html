This is an habitual phrase of St. Paul (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-4.htm">1 Corinthians 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-16.htm">Ephesians 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-3.htm">Philippians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-3.htm">2 Timothy 1:3</a>). "It is to be noted that for the thing on account of which he gives thanks, he at the same time prays" (Calvin). For no good work is ever so complete in us that it does not need to be "continued and ended" in us by God. <span class="cmt_word">Making mention of thee in my prayers.</span> The foregoing remark attain applies. Grotius observes that "we learn from this that all addresses to God may be <span class="accented">called prayers</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span>, even those in which nothing is asked but thanks are given." But this is apparently not such a case; the petition which St. Paul offered for Philemon being stated in Ver. 6. And thus Chrysostom explains the passage. "Always" may be connected with "I thank," or with "making mention," preferably the former (Chrysostom, Theophylact, Calvin, Lightfoot). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philemon/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 Faith in Christ, and love to him, should unite saints more closely than any outward relation can unite the people of the world. Paul in his private prayers was particular in remembering his friends. We must remember Christian friends much and often, as their cases may need, bearing them in our thoughts, and upon our hearts, before our God. Different sentiments and ways in what is not essential, must not make difference of affection, as to the truth. He inquired concerning his friends, as to the truth, growth, and fruitfulness of their graces, their faith in Christ, and love to him, and to all the saints. The good which Philemon did, was matter of joy and comfort to him and others, who therefore desired that he would continue and abound in good fruits, more and more, to God's honour.</body></html>
