All thoughtful readers of the Epistle must recognise in this a peculiar courtesy and delicacy of tone, through which an affectionate earnestness shows itself, and an authority all the greater because it is not asserted in command. The substance is equally notable in its bearing on slavery. Onesimus is doubly welcomed into the Christian family. He is St. Paul's son in the faith: he is to Philemon a brother beloved in the Lord. In that recognition is the truth to which, both in theory and in practice, we may look as being the destruction of slavery.<p>(8, 9) <span class= "bld">Wherefore . . . for love's sake . . .</span>--Still the same idea runs on. Philemon's love, shown in Christian fellowship, is in the Apostle's mind; "therefore," he adds, "for love's sake"--speaking in the spirit of love, to which he knew there would be a ready response--he will not command, as an Apostle, what is "convenient," <span class= "ital">i.e., seemly, </span>in a Christian (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-14.htm" title="Why he said, Awake you that sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light.">Ephesians 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-18.htm" title=" Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.">Colossians 3:18</a>), but will "entreat" as a brother.<p>(9) <span class= "bld">Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</span>--At this time St. Paul must have been between fifty and sixty, and after a life of unexampled labour and suffering he might well call himself "aged," not, perhaps, in comparison with Philemon, but in relation to his need of ministry from his "son" Onesimus. It has been suggested by Dr. Lightfoot that we should read here (by a slight change, or without any change, in the original), <span class= "ital">the ambassador, and also</span> <span class= "ital">the prisoner, of Jesus Christ.</span> The parallel with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-20.htm" title="For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.">Ephesians 6:20</a>--"for which I am an ambassador in bonds"--and, indeed, with the tone in which St. Paul in the other Epistles speaks of his captivity as his glory, is tempting. But the change seems to take much from the peculiar beauty and pathos of the passage; which fr<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philemon/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - Render: <span class="cmt_word">Although I have abundant freedom</span> [boldness, or. even license] <span class="cmt_word">in Christ to enjoin upon thee that which is fitting.</span> It was only <span class="accented">in Christ</span>, and by his authority as an apostle, that he could claim to come between a slave and his master. Secular warrant for doing so he had none. Such authority and license, however, he would not use on this occasion. He prefers to rely wholly on the respect and personal attachment felt towards him by Philemon, for the granting of his request, which he now proceeds to state. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philemon/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:8-14 It does not lower any one to condescend, and sometimes even to beseech, where, in strictness of right, we might command: the apostle argues from love, rather than authority, in behalf of one converted through his means; and this was Onesimus. In allusion to that name, which signifies profitable, the apostle allows that in time past he had been unprofitable to Philemon, but hastens to mention the change by which he had become profitable. Unholy persons are unprofitable; they answer not the great end of their being. But what happy changes conversion makes! of evil, good; of unprofitable, useful. Religious servants are treasures in a family. Such will make conscience of their time and trusts, and manage all they can for the best. No prospect of usefulness should lead any to neglect their obligations, or to fail in obedience to superiors. One great evidence of true repentance consists in returning to practise the duties which have been neglected. In his unconverted state, Onesimus had withdrawn, to his master's injury; but now he had seen his sin and repented, he was willing and desirous to return to his duty. Little do men know for what purposes the Lord leaves some to change their situations, or engage in undertakings, perhaps from evil motives. Had not the Lord overruled some of our ungodly projects, we may reflect upon cases, in which our destruction must have been sure.</body></html>
