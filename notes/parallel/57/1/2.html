There seems little doubt that Apphia was Philemon's wife, like himself "the beloved," though not the "fellow-labourer" or "partner" of St. Paul.<p><span class= "bld">Archippus our fellow soldier.</span>--From this mention of Archippus we may certainly conclude that he was a member of Philemon's family; the ordinary conjecture makes him his son. The name "fellow-soldier," applied elsewhere only to Epaphroditus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-25.htm" title="Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.">Philippians 2:25</a>), as the name "soldier of Jesus Christ" to Timothy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-3.htm" title="You therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.">2Timothy 2:3</a>), appears to denote ministerial office in Archippus, which agrees with the charge to him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-18.htm" title=" The salutation by the hand of me Paul.

The specially domestic and personal character of the Epistle need not induce any limitation of the phrase to Philemon's own family. As the joining of Timothy's name in giving the salutation did not prevent the Letter from being St. Paul's only, so the joining the Church in the house in the receiving of the salutation does not prevent its being addressed only to Philemon and his family, who were, like himself, interested in Onesimus.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philemon/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Our beloved Apphia</span>. Codices A, D*, E*, F, G, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> (Sinaiticus) read <span class="accented">adelphe</span> (sister) for <span class="accented">agapete</span> (beloved), and also Jerome, Griesbach, Meyer; which also has been adopted in the Revised Version. The name Appia, or Apphia, is either the Roman Appia Hellenized, which was the conjecture of Grotins (see Introduction), or more probably a native Phrygian name, from <span class="accented">Appa</span> or <span class="accented">Appha</span>, <span class="accented">a term of endearment</span>. The name does not occur elsewhere in Scripture. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x1fc6;</span> is not unlikely to have been added by way of explanation. St. Paul has used it in five other places, and always in the same sense, viz. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-15.htm">1 Corinthians 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-2.htm">1 Timothy 5:2</a>. Most commentators, and particularly Chrysostom, Theodoret, and Theophylact, among the ancients, infer that Apphia was the wife of Philemon. Otherwise, why mention her name here? <span class="cmt_word">Archippus</span>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-17.htm">Colossians 4:17</a>, where he is said to have received a <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e. a</span> ministry or service, in the Church. This word, when used without a determining genitive, denotes <span class="accented">service to</span> others in a general and undefined sense. But more commonly with some limiting word; as <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, office of teaching (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-4.htm">Acts 6:4</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, office or function of death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7</a>). The general view is that Archippus was the presbyter who ministered to that congregation which assembled at the house of Philemon, though Ambrose and Jerome, with other commentators ancient and modern, think that he was the bishop. Grotius, however, takes him to have been a deacon. (It is a very precarious inference that he was <span class="accented">a son</span> of Philemon and Appia.) Probably he was fulfilling a temporary mission only in Colossae, and that would be the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in the passage cited. Epaphras, a resident in Colossae (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>), is spoken of as having been the founder of the Church there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7, 8</a>), and as still being responsible for it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-13.htm">Colossians 4:13</a>). Primasius calls Epaphras bishop and Archippus deacon; and so Grotius. It may be that these theories err in ascribing too rigid and technical a meaning to the terms of ecclesiastical service at this early stage of their employment. Epaphras was, however, at this time in Rome with St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12, 13</a>), and it is possible that Archippus was filling his place temporarily. It will be safer to call him (with Bishop Wordsworth) a presbyter. It is, as we have said, an unsupported idea of some writers ancient and modern (Theod. Mopsuest., Michaelis, Rosenmuller, Olshausen, Lightfoot) that he was the <span class="accented">son</span> of Philemon (but see below). <span class="cmt_word">Our fellow-soldier</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of himself and St. Timothy, as engaged in the same warfare for Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-7.htm">1 Corinthians 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-18.htm">1 Timothy 1:18</a>). The same term is applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25</a> to Epaphroditus, and also the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> of Ver. 1. And to the <span class="cmt_word">Church in thy house.</span> Mede (so Chrysostom and Theodoret also) understands this as meaning "and to the whole of thy family" (which is a Christian one) - a suggestion quite worth considering. For a separate letter "to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colossae" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-2.htm">Colossians 1:2</a>) was brought by the same messengers, and it would seem natural that, in a matter so personal to Philemon, salutations should be confined to his own family. The phrase is used more than once (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-5.htm">Romans 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>, which seems rather to point the other way; but especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-15.htm">Colossians 4:15</a>, "Nymphas and the Church which is in his house," which, since it was in Colossae itself, seems almost conclusive for that meaning). The <span class="accented">Ecclesia domestica</span> was very familiar in the apostolic times. Theodoret states that the house of Philemon was still pointed out as late as the fifth century. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philemon/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 Faith in Christ, and love to him, should unite saints more closely than any outward relation can unite the people of the world. Paul in his private prayers was particular in remembering his friends. We must remember Christian friends much and often, as their cases may need, bearing them in our thoughts, and upon our hearts, before our God. Different sentiments and ways in what is not essential, must not make difference of affection, as to the truth. He inquired concerning his friends, as to the truth, growth, and fruitfulness of their graces, their faith in Christ, and love to him, and to all the saints. The good which Philemon did, was matter of joy and comfort to him and others, who therefore desired that he would continue and abound in good fruits, more and more, to God's honour.</body></html>
