There is, indeed, an usage of the word which applies it to children as begotten of our own body. But this is hardly St. Paul's usage (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-12.htm" title="You are not straitened in us, but you are straitened in your own bowels.">2Corinthians 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-8.htm" title="For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.">Philippians 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-1.htm" title="If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,">Philippians 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;">Colossians 3:12</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-7.htm" title="For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by you, brother.">Philemon 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-20.htm" title="Yes, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.">Philemon 1:20</a> of this Epistle), though it suits very well with the phrase "whom I have begotten" above.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philemon/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whom I sent back</span> [<span class="cmt_word">to thee</span>, according to A, C, D*, E, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;</span>] (aorist for present); but the decision reflects the struggle. It had not been altogether easy for the apostle to part with the youth, whom he might not see again. The whole Epistle is full of this strong and yearning affection. Thou therefore receive him. Do thou also act as becomes a Christian; receive him as my son. "Wonderfully efficacious this method for appeasing the anger of Philemon! For he was not able to rage or to do anything harshly against one whom Paul had called his own bowels" (Estius). A, F, G, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> omit "receive," as also Tischendorf. The Revised Version omits this clause. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philemon/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:8-14 It does not lower any one to condescend, and sometimes even to beseech, where, in strictness of right, we might command: the apostle argues from love, rather than authority, in behalf of one converted through his means; and this was Onesimus. In allusion to that name, which signifies profitable, the apostle allows that in time past he had been unprofitable to Philemon, but hastens to mention the change by which he had become profitable. Unholy persons are unprofitable; they answer not the great end of their being. But what happy changes conversion makes! of evil, good; of unprofitable, useful. Religious servants are treasures in a family. Such will make conscience of their time and trusts, and manage all they can for the best. No prospect of usefulness should lead any to neglect their obligations, or to fail in obedience to superiors. One great evidence of true repentance consists in returning to practise the duties which have been neglected. In his unconverted state, Onesimus had withdrawn, to his master's injury; but now he had seen his sin and repented, he was willing and desirous to return to his duty. Little do men know for what purposes the Lord leaves some to change their situations, or engage in undertakings, perhaps from evil motives. Had not the Lord overruled some of our ungodly projects, we may reflect upon cases, in which our destruction must have been sure.</body></html>
