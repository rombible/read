St. Paul now touches on Onesimus' "being parted" from Philemon, using a phrase not only (as has been noted) euphemistic, but also one which suggested that his running away was, however unconsciously, overruled by a higher hand. God, in His wisdom, "parted" him from Philemon "for a season, that he might receive him for ever." The phrase "for ever" is the word always used for "eternal." The contrast with "for a season" might be satisfied here by the merely relative sense of "perpetual" or "life-long service;" but, considering that the phrase is used in direct reference to the brotherhood of the Communion of Saints, it is better to take it in its absolute sense, of fellowship in the life eternal.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philemon/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>; for this purpose (final cause). <span class="cmt_word">Departed for a season.</span> He was therefore parted from thee for a time (Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">Forever</span>; everlastingly (accusative, not an adverb). The relation of master and slave would have been in any case, and would still be, terminated by death. But it was now replaced by a new relation of Christian brotherhood, which would be permanent - a great advantage. So Calvin, Grotius, and many others. Meyer's objection does not seem of much weight (compare the <span class="accented">Perpetua mancipia</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-17.htm">Deuteronomy 15:17</a>). Baur thinks that in this verse he has reached the core of the Epistle - the ethical truth which it seeks to embody (but see Introduction: "Authenticity and Characteristics"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philemon/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-22 When we speak of the nature of any sin or offence against God, the evil of it is not to be lessened; but in a penitent sinner, as God covers it, so must we. Such changed characters often become a blessing to all among whom they reside. Christianity does not do away our duties to others, but directs to the right doing of them. True penitents will be open in owning their faults, as doubtless Onesimus had been to Paul, upon his being awakened and brought to repentance; especially in cases of injury done to others. The communion of saints does not destroy distinction of property. This passage is an instance of that being imputed to one, which is contracted by another; and of one becoming answerable for another, by a voluntary engagement, that he might be freed from the punishment due to his crimes, according to the doctrine that Christ of his own will bore the punishment of our sins, that we might receive the reward of his righteousness. Philemon was Paul's son in the faith, yet he entreated him as a brother. Onesimus was a poor slave, yet Paul besought for him as if seeking some great thing for himself. Christians should do what may give joy to the hearts of one another. From the world they expect trouble; they should find comfort and joy in one another. When any of our mercies are taken away, our trust and hope must be in God. We must diligently use the means, and if no other should be at hand, abound in prayer. Yet, though prayer prevails, it does not merit the things obtained. And if Christians do not meet on earth, still the grace of the Lord Jesus will be with their spirits, and they will soon meet before the throne to join for ever in admiring the riches of redeeming love. The example of Onesimus may encourage the vilest sinners to return to God, but it is shamefully prevented, if any are made bold thereby to persist in evil courses. Are not many taken away in their sins, while others become more hardened? Resist not present convictions, lest they return no more.</body></html>
