In the other Epistles of this period (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/3-1.htm" title="For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,">Ephesians 3:1-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm" title="I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation with which you are called,">Ephesians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-20.htm" title="For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.">Ephesians 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/1-12.htm" title="But I would you should understand, brothers, that the things which happened to me have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel;">Philippians 1:12-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-18.htm" title=" The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.">Colossians 4:18</a>) the Apostle's captivity is dwelt upon mainly as a ground of glory and thankfulness, only secondarily as a cause for sympathy. Here, on the contrary, in this personal Epistle, and in accordance with St. Paul's courteous determination "not to command, but for love's sake to entreat," the latter aspect assumes an almost exclusive prominence.<p><span class= "bld">Timothy.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm" title="Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-1.htm" title=" Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,">Colossians 1:1</a>. Here, as in the other Epistles, the salutation includes Timothy, as desiring to imply in him, St. Paul's "own son in the faith," a closeness of connection and sympathy with the Apostle not found in others. But in all cases, and especially in this, the Letter is emphatically the Letter of St. Paul alone.<p><span class= "bld">Philemon.</span>--See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philemon/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A prisoner of Christ Jesus.</span> He writes a private letter, as friend to friend, and therefore does not describe himself by his official title of apostle. Having to plead the cause of a <span class="accented">slave</span>, he begins by putting himself into a similar position as the "bondman of Jesus Christ" -"to obtain thereby the more ready compliance" (Chrysostom). By such a reverend bondage he beseeches Philemon, "and the bondage of Paul was liberty to Onesimus" (Scipio Gentilis). <span class="cmt_word">Timothy</span>, etc. He was, then, with St. Paul at the time of writing; therefore at Rome; and this fixes the date of composition at all events before that of the Second Epistle to Timothy, when the apostle was again at Rome (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-17.htm">2 Timothy 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6, 16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Fellow-worker</span> with St. Paul in promoting the spread of the gospel, either by his wealth and influence, less probably by preaching. The time <span class="accented">when</span> would be that of St. Paul's long stay at Ephesus and its neighborhood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-8.htm">Acts 19:8-22</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philemon/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 Faith in Christ, and love to him, should unite saints more closely than any outward relation can unite the people of the world. Paul in his private prayers was particular in remembering his friends. We must remember Christian friends much and often, as their cases may need, bearing them in our thoughts, and upon our hearts, before our God. Different sentiments and ways in what is not essential, must not make difference of affection, as to the truth. He inquired concerning his friends, as to the truth, growth, and fruitfulness of their graces, their faith in Christ, and love to him, and to all the saints. The good which Philemon did, was matter of joy and comfort to him and others, who therefore desired that he would continue and abound in good fruits, more and more, to God's honour.</body></html>
