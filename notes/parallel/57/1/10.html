At last the name is given, and even then comes, in the same breath, the declaration of the change in him from past uselessness to present usefulness, both to the Apostle and to his former master.<p><span class= "bld">Onesimus.</span>--Of Onesimus we know absolutely nothing, except what we read here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-9.htm" title=" With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you.

Tradition, of course, is busy with his name, and makes him Bishop of Ber?a, in Macedonia, or identifies him with the Onesimus, Bishop of Ephesus, mentioned in the Ignatian <span class= "ital">Epistle to the Ephesians</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-2.htm" title="Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.">Ephesians 1:2-6</a>). The name was a common one, especially among slaves.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philemon/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I beseech thee for my son ... Onesimus</span>; <span class="accented">my child</span> (Revised Version). The name of Onesimus could not have been a pleasing one in the ears of Philemon. Note with what caution and almost timidity it is at length introduced. He does not interpose for the ingrate with apostolic dignity, but pleads for him with fatherly love. He puts himself side by side with him, and calls him <span class="accented">his son</span>. Some of the old commentators conclude, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-9.htm">Colossians 4:9</a>, that Onesimus was a native of Colossae, and thence discuss whether he could have been a slave born in Philemon's house of a slave-mother, or whether he was sold in his youth by his father - a custom so common to the Phrygians (as to the Circassians in later times) as to have been noticed by Cicero. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philemon/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:8-14 It does not lower any one to condescend, and sometimes even to beseech, where, in strictness of right, we might command: the apostle argues from love, rather than authority, in behalf of one converted through his means; and this was Onesimus. In allusion to that name, which signifies profitable, the apostle allows that in time past he had been unprofitable to Philemon, but hastens to mention the change by which he had become profitable. Unholy persons are unprofitable; they answer not the great end of their being. But what happy changes conversion makes! of evil, good; of unprofitable, useful. Religious servants are treasures in a family. Such will make conscience of their time and trusts, and manage all they can for the best. No prospect of usefulness should lead any to neglect their obligations, or to fail in obedience to superiors. One great evidence of true repentance consists in returning to practise the duties which have been neglected. In his unconverted state, Onesimus had withdrawn, to his master's injury; but now he had seen his sin and repented, he was willing and desirous to return to his duty. Little do men know for what purposes the Lord leaves some to change their situations, or engage in undertakings, perhaps from evil motives. Had not the Lord overruled some of our ungodly projects, we may reflect upon cases, in which our destruction must have been sure.</body></html>
