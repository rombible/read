(1) One is that "faith" here (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-3.htm" title="For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?">Romans 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm" title="But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,">Galatians 5:22</a>) is simply fidelity; but this can hardly be accepted as an explanation of so well-known and almost technical a phrase as "faith toward the Lord Jesus Christ." (2) Another, noting the distinction in the original between the two prepositions here--the former (<span class= "ital">pros</span>) signifying direction towards, and the latter (<span class= "ital">eis</span>) actual contact with, its object--explains the phrase as signifying "the faith which has as its object the Lord Jesus Christ, but which shows itself practically towards all saints." But this, even if the word "hast" will bear this gloss, seems too artificial for such a Letter as this. (3) The comparison with the contemporaneous Letter to the Colossians--where we read, "your faith in the Lord Jesus, and your love toward all the saints" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-4.htm" title=" Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have to all the saints,">Colossians 1:4</a>)--seems to clear up the matter. We have here an equivalent phrase, in which, however (by what the grammarians called <span class= "ital">chiasmus</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>the extremes and means correspond to each other. The idea which runs through the Letter is Philemon's "love to the saints." In writing of that love St. Paul cannot refrain from (4) referring it to its true origin--the faith towards the Lord Jesus Christ. Hence the broken phrase. The sense seems therefore to be that which in some MSS. has been brought out by a natural correction, "thy faith towards the Lord Jesus, and thy love to all the saints."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philemon/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hearing of thy love, and of the faith ... saints.</span> He would hear of these instances of Philemon's faith and love naturally through Epaphras (see on Ver. 2). Refer "faith" to "the Lord Jesus" and "love" to "all the saints" (a <span class="accented">chiasmus</span>, or cross-reference). Note that the phrase is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="accented">i.e. erga</span>, towards) <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> upon) <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>; perhaps because Christ cannot now be <span class="accented">reached</span> by bodily efforts, but only <span class="accented">aspired towards</span> by the soul; while the poor can actually be reached and ministered unto. "Ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not always" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-11.htm">Matthew 26:11</a>). All Christians are called "saints" in the Scriptures, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-1.htm">Ephesians 1:1</a>, and invariably. What a reminder to them of their "<span class="accented">holy calling"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9</a>)! Meyer notes, however, that it is not uncommon with St. Paul to vary the preposition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philemon/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 Faith in Christ, and love to him, should unite saints more closely than any outward relation can unite the people of the world. Paul in his private prayers was particular in remembering his friends. We must remember Christian friends much and often, as their cases may need, bearing them in our thoughts, and upon our hearts, before our God. Different sentiments and ways in what is not essential, must not make difference of affection, as to the truth. He inquired concerning his friends, as to the truth, growth, and fruitfulness of their graces, their faith in Christ, and love to him, and to all the saints. The good which Philemon did, was matter of joy and comfort to him and others, who therefore desired that he would continue and abound in good fruits, more and more, to God's honour.</body></html>
