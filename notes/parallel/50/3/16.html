The original runs thus: <span class= "ital">Nevertheless</span>--<span class= "ital">as to that to which we did attain</span>--<span class= "ital">let us walk by the same.</span> The word "walk" is always used of pursuing a course deliberately chosen. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-24.htm" title="Them take, and purify yourself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning you, are nothing; but that you yourself also walk orderly, and keep the law.">Acts 21:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-12.htm" title="And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.">Romans 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-25.htm" title="If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.">Galatians 5:25</a>.) The nearest parallel (from which the gloss is partly taken) is <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-16.htm" title="And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and on the Israel of God.">Galatians 6:16</a>, "As many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them." In this passage there seems to be the same double reference which has pervaded all St. Paul's practical teaching. He is anxious for two things--that they should keep on in one course, and that all should keep on together. In both senses he addresses the "perfect;" he will have them understand that they have attained only one thing--to be in the right path, and that it is for them to continue in it; he also bids them refrain from setting themselves up above "the imperfect;" for the very fact of division would mark them as still "carnal," mere "babes in Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="And I, brothers, could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, even as to babes in Christ.">1Corinthians 3:1-4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing</span>. Omit, with the best manuscripts, the words from "rule" to "thing," and translate, <span class="accented">R.V.</span>, <span class="accented">only</span>, <span class="accented">whereunto we have already attained</span>, <span class="accented">by that same</span> (<span class="accented">rule</span>) <span class="accented">let us walk</span>; or, more literally, <span class="accented">only</span>, <span class="accented">what we arrived at</span>, <span class="accented">by that same walk. Let</span> there be no falling back; let us, at each point in our Christian course, maintain and walk according to that degree of grace at which we arrived. This explanation seems more probable than the other view, which understands the words, "by the same," of the rule of faith as opposed to the works of the Law. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-21 This simple dependence and earnestness of soul, were not mentioned as if the apostle had gained the prize, or were already made perfect in the Saviour's likeness. He forgot the things which were behind, so as not to be content with past labours or present measures of grace. He reached forth, stretched himself forward towards his point; expressions showing great concern to become more and more like unto Christ. He who runs a race, must never stop short of the end, but press forward as fast as he can; so those who have heaven in their view, must still press forward to it, in holy desires and hopes, and constant endeavours. Eternal life is the gift of God, but it is in Christ Jesus; through his hand it must come to us, as it is procured for us by him. There is no getting to heaven as our home, but by Christ as our Way. True believers, in seeking this assurance, as well as to glorify him, will seek more nearly to resemble his sufferings and death, by dying to sin, and by crucifying the flesh with its affections and lusts. In these things there is a great difference among real Christians, but all know something of them. Believers make Christ all in all, and set their hearts upon another world. If they differ from one another, and are not of the same judgment in lesser matters, yet they must not judge one another; while they all meet now in Christ, and hope to meet shortly in heaven. Let them join in all the great things in which they are agreed, and wait for further light as to lesser things wherein they differ. The enemies of the cross of Christ mind nothing but their sensual appetites. Sin is the sinner's shame, especially when gloried in. The way of those who mind earthly things, may seem pleasant, but death and hell are at the end of it. If we choose their way, we shall share their end. The life of a Christian is in heaven, where his Head and his home are, and where he hopes to be shortly; he sets his affections upon things above; and where his heart is, there will his conversation be. There is glory kept for the bodies of the saints, in which they will appear at the resurrection. Then the body will be made glorious; not only raised again to life, but raised to great advantage. Observe the power by which this change will be wrought. May we be always prepared for the coming of our Judge; looking to have our vile bodies changed by his Almighty power, and applying to him daily to new-create our souls unto holiness; to deliver us from our enemies, and to employ our bodies and souls as instruments of righteousness in his service.</body></html>
