This "conformity to the image of Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-29.htm" title="For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.">Romans 8:29-30</a>)--with which compare the having "Christ formed within us" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-19.htm" title="My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,">Galatians 4:19</a>)--is made by St. Paul the substance of the gracious predestination of God, preceding the call, the justification, the glorification, which mark the various epochs of Christian life.<p>(10, 11) The order of these verses is notable and instructive. (1) First comes the knowledge of "the power of the Resurrection." What this is we see by examining it as historically the main subject of the first apostolic preaching. There it is considered, as in St. Peter's first sermons, as giving the earnest of "forgiveness," or "blotting out of sins," and the "gift of the Holy Ghost" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm" title="Then Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-13.htm" title="The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus; whom you delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.">Acts 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-26.htm" title="To you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.">Acts 3:26</a>), or, as St. Paul expresses it, of "justification from all things" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/13-38.htm" title="Be it known to you therefore, men and brothers, that through this man is preached to you the forgiveness of sins:">Acts 13:38-39</a>). This same idea is wrought out fully in his Epistles. Thus, for example, without it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-17.htm" title="And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; you are yet in your sins.">1Corinthians 15:17</a>) "we are still in our sins." It is the pledge of our justification (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-1.htm" title="Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:">Romans 5:1</a>), and the means of our being "alive unto God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-11.htm" title="Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 6:11</a>). Hence "the power," or <span class= "ital">efficacy, </span>"of His resurrection" is the justification, and regeneration inseparable from it, which lie at the entrance of Christian life. (2) Next comes the "partaking of His sufferings" and "conformity to His death," which are the "taking up the cross, and following Him," in the obedience even unto death. This "fellowship of sufferings," coming partly from the sin of others, partly from our own, is the constant theme of the New Testament. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-13.htm" title="But rejoice, inasmuch as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy.">1Peter 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-5.htm" title="For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds by Christ.">2Corinthians 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-11.htm" title="It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:">2Timothy 2:11</a>.) The "conformity to His death" is the completion of the death unto sin, described as "mortification" of sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a>); "as bearing about in the body the dying (or, properly, <span class= "ital">mortification</span>) of the Lord Jesus" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.">2Corinthians 4:10</a>); or more frequently as being "crucified with Christ," "the world to us and we to the world" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-24.htm" title="And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.">Galatians 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-14.htm" title="But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.">Galatians 6:14</a>). (3) Lastly comes the "attainment to the resurrection of the dead," properly, "the resurrection <span class= "ital">from</span> the dead," which is (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-35.htm" title="But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:">Luke 20:35</a>) the resurrection unto life and the glorification in Him, so nobly described below (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Philippians 3:20-21</a>). "If we have been planted together in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-5.htm" title="For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:">Romans 6:5</a>). For of our resurrection (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-12.htm" title="Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?">1Corinthians 15:12-23</a>) His resurrection is not only the pledge, but the earnest. Note how in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm" title="For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.">1Thessalonians 4:14-18</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1Corinthians 15:51-57</a>, the whole description is only of the resurrection unto life, and compare the first resurrection of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-6.htm" title="Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection: on such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.">Revelation 20:6</a>. This is the completion of all; St. Paul dared not as yet anticipate it with the confidence which hereafter soothed his dying hour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/4-7.htm" title="I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:">2Timothy 4:7-8</a>).<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/3-12.htm" title="Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.">Philippians 3:12-16</a> lead us from the warning against trust in human merit to deprecate the supposition of a perfection here attained even in Christ. The transition is natural. The same spirit which shows itself undisguisedly in the one pretension, comes out half-concealed in the other.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That I may know him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>). For the grammatical construction, see Winer, sect. 44:b. For the sense, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>, where Dr. Westcott notes, "In such a connection, <span class="accented">Knowledge</span> expresses the apprehension of the truth by the whole nature of man. It is not an acquaintance with facts as external, nor an intellectual conviction of their reality, but an appropriation of them (so to speak) as an influencing power into the very being of him who <span class="accented">knows</span> them." <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> differs from <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is "to know," <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is "to recognize" or "to become acquainted with." We must be found in Christ in order to know him; we must have that righteousness which is through the faith of Christ, for we can know him only by being made like unto him. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2</a>, "When he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is;" and now those who see him by faith are in their measure being transformed into the same image. For the knowledge here spoken of is a personal knowledge, gained, not by hearing or reading, but by direct personal communion with the Lord; it is not theoretical, but experimental. "non expertus fuerit, non intelligit" (Anselm, quoted by Meyer). <span class="cmt_word">And the power of his resurrection</span>. The resurrection of Christ was a glorious manifestation of Divine power (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>). That resurrection is now a power in the spiritual life of Christians: it stimulates the spiritual resurrection, the resurrection from the death of sin unto the life of righteousness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>). It is the center of our most cherished hopes, the evidence of our immortality, the earnest of the resurrection of the body. <span class="cmt_word">And the fellowship of his sufferings</span>. This clause and the last are bound together under one article, according to the best manuscripts. There is a very close connection between them (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-11.htm">2 Timothy 2:11, 12</a>). To know the quickening power of his resurrection, we must share his sufferings. The Christian, meditating in loving thought on the sufferings of Christ, is led to feel ever a deeper, a more awful sympathy with the suffering Savior. And if, when we are called to suffer, we take it patiently, looking unto Jesus, then our sufferings are united with his sufferings, "we suffer <span class="accented">with</span> him." And he who hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows feels for us in his sacred heart, being "touched with the feeling of our infirmities." This fellowship in suffering leads through his grace to fellowship in glory (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-5.htm">Romans 6:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Being made conformable unto his death</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">becoming conformed.</span> The participle is present: it implies a continual progress. It is derived from the word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, form, used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a> (where see note), and denotes, not a mere external resemblance, but a deep, real, inner conformity. The reference is not to the impending death of martyrdom, but to that daffy dying unto self and the world which the apostle exhibited in the heroic self-denials of his holy life: he was "crucified with Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-31.htm">1 Corinthians 15:31</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-11 Sincere Christians rejoice in Christ Jesus. The prophet calls the false prophets dumb dogs, Isa 56:10; to which the apostle seems to refer. Dogs, for their malice against faithful professors of the gospel of Christ, barking at them and biting them. They urged human works in opposition to the faith of Christ; but Paul calls them evil-workers. He calls them the concision; as they rent the church of Christ, and cut it to pieces. The work of religion is to no purpose, unless the heart is in it, and we must worship God in the strength and grace of the Divine Spirit. They rejoice in Christ Jesus, not in mere outward enjoyments and performances. Nor can we too earnestly guard against those who oppose or abuse the doctrine of free salvation. If the apostle would have gloried and trusted in the flesh, he had as much cause as any man. But the things which he counted gain while a Pharisee, and had reckoned up, those he counted loss for Christ. The apostle did not persuade them to do any thing but what he himself did; or to venture on any thing but that on which he himself ventured his never-dying soul. He deemed all these things to be but loss, compared with the knowledge of Christ, by faith in his person and salvation. He speaks of all worldly enjoyments and outward privileges which sought a place with Christ in his heart, or could pretend to any merit and desert, and counted them but loss; but it might be said, It is easy to say so; but what would he do when he came to the trial? He had suffered the loss of all for the privileges of a Christian. Nay, he not only counted them loss, but the vilest refuse, offals thrown to dogs; not only less valuable than Christ, but in the highest degree contemptible, when set up as against him. True knowledge of Christ alters and changes men, their judgments and manners, and makes them as if made again anew. The believer prefers Christ, knowing that it is better for us to be without all worldly riches, than without Christ and his word. Let us see what the apostle resolved to cleave to, and that was Christ and heaven. We are undone, without righteousness wherein to appear before God, for we are guilty. There is a righteousness provided for us in Jesus Christ, and it is a complete and perfect righteousness. None can have benefit by it, who trust in themselves. Faith is the appointed means of applying the saving benefit. It is by faith in Christ's blood. We are made conformable to Christ's death, when we die to sin, as he died for sin; and the world is crucified to us, and we to the world, by the cross of Christ. The apostle was willing to do or to suffer any thing, to attain the glorious resurrection of saints. This hope and prospect carried him through all difficulties in his work. He did not hope to attain it through his own merit and righteousness, but through the merit and righteousness of Jesus Christ.</body></html>
