Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.">2Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-10.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.">Ephesians 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-1.htm" title="Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:">2Thessalonians 3:1</a> (as also in this Epistle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-8.htm" title="Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.">Philippians 4:8</a>), to usher in the conclusion. Here, on the contrary, it stands nearly in the middle of the Epistle. Moreover, the commendation above of Timothy and Epaphroditus is exactly that which, according to St. Paul's custom, would mark the final sentences of the whole. Again, the words "rejoice in the Lord" may, according to the common usage of the time (although certainly that usage is not adopted in other Letters of St. Paul), not improbably signify <span class= "ital">farewell in the Lord;</span> and even if not used in this formal and conventional sense, yet certainly hold the position of final good wishes, which that sense implies. The resumption of them in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-4.htm" title="Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice.">Philippians 4:4</a>, where the actual conclusion now begins, is striking. It seems, therefore, highly probable, that in this place the Letter was originally drawing to an end, and that some news was at that moment brought which induced the Apostle to add a second part, couched in language of equal affection, but of greater anxiety and more emphatic warning. Of such a break, and resumption with a far more complete change of style, we have a notable instance at the beginning of the tenth chapter of the Second Epistle to the Corinthians; as also of the addition of postscript after postscript in the last chapter of the Epistle to the Romans.<p>[<span class= "bld">7.Words of Warning </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-1.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord.

Now, it is true that this is the burden of the Epistle; but this interpretation suits ill the following words, "for you it is safe," which obviously refer to some warning against danger or temptation. Hence it is far better to refer them to the abrupt and incisive warnings that follow.<p>These, then, are said to be a repetition; but of what? Hardly of the former part of this Epistle, for it is difficult there to find anything corresponding to them. If not, then it must be of St. Paul's previous teaching, by word or by letter. For the use here of the word "to write," though it suits better the idea of former communication by writing, cannot exclude oral teaching. That there was more than one Epistle to Philippi has been inferred (probably, but not certainly) from an expression in Polycarp's letter to the Philippians (sect. 3), speaking of "the Epistles" of St. Paul to them. It is not in itself unlikely that another Epistle should have been written; nor have we any right to argue decisively against it, on the ground that no such Epistle is found in the canon of Scripture. But however this may be, it seems natural to refer to St. Paul's former teaching as a whole. Now, when St. Paul first preached at Philippi, he had not long before carried to Antioch the decree of the council against the contention of "them of the circumcision;" and, as it was addressed to the churches "of Syria and Cilicia," he can hardly have failed to communicate it, when he passed through both regions "confirming the churches" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-41.htm" title="And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.">Acts 15:41</a>). At Thessalonica, not long after, the jealousy of the Jews at his preaching the freedom of the gospel drove him from the city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-5.htm" title="But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took to them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.">Acts 17:5</a>). When he came to Macedonia on his next journey, the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, written there and probably at Philippi, marks the first outburst of the Judaising controversy; and when he returned to Philippi, on his way back, he had just written the Epistles to the Galatians and Romans, which deal exhaustively with the whole question. Nothing is more likely than that his teaching at Philippi had largely dealt with the warning against the Judaisers. What, then, more natural than to introduce a new warning on the subject--shown to be necessary by news received--with the courteous half-apology, "To write the same things to you, to me is not grievous (or, <span class= "ital">tedious</span>) but for you it is safe," making assurance doubly sure?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord</span>. This word "finally" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> is frequently used by St. Paul to introduce a practical conclusion after the doctrinal portion of his Epistles: thus it occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>, and also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:1</a>. Some render <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> "farewell;" but "rejoice" seems more suitable here. The golden thread of spiritual joy runs through this Epistle. "Rejoice in the Lord" is the oft-repeated refrain of St. Paul's solemn hymn of praise. <span class="cmt_word">To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe</span>. "The same things:" does he refer to his oral instructions, to a previous Epistle now lost, to his exhortations to unity, or to his reiterated command "Rejoice"? The words seem most naturally to point to something in the same Epistle rather than to advice given on former occasions. It is true that Polycarp, in his letter to the Philippiaus (section 3), says that St. Paul wrote Epistles (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>) to them; but there is no trace of any other Epistle; and the mere plural number is not sufficient to support the theory of other letters, the plural word being frequently used of a single letter. Bishop Lightfoot suggests the exhortation to unity in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a>. But this topic does not reappear before <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-2.htm">Philippians 4:2</a>. And the hypothesis of an interruption, which (as Bishop Lightfoot and others think) suddenly turned the apostle's thoughts into another channel and prevented him from explaining <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span> (the same things) till <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-2.htm">Philippians 4:2</a>, seems forced and unnecessary, notwithstanding the great authority by which it is supported. It seems more probable (Bengel and others) that St. Paul refers to the constant admonition of this Epistle, "Rejoice in the Lord." To repeat this again and again was to him not grievous (rather, with R.V., "irksome"), but safe for the Philippians. Christian joy has a close connection with safety, for it implies unswerving faith, and, more than that, the presence of Christ. Compare the oft-repeated exhortation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37.htm">Psalm 37</a>, "Fret not thyself: it tends only to evil-doing" (ver. 8, in the Hebrew). Possibly, however, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c2;</span> here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-30.htm">Acts 22:30</a> and. 25:26, may mean "certain." The repetition is not irksome to St. Paul, while it makes his meaning and his wishes certain to the Philippians. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-11 Sincere Christians rejoice in Christ Jesus. The prophet calls the false prophets dumb dogs, Isa 56:10; to which the apostle seems to refer. Dogs, for their malice against faithful professors of the gospel of Christ, barking at them and biting them. They urged human works in opposition to the faith of Christ; but Paul calls them evil-workers. He calls them the concision; as they rent the church of Christ, and cut it to pieces. The work of religion is to no purpose, unless the heart is in it, and we must worship God in the strength and grace of the Divine Spirit. They rejoice in Christ Jesus, not in mere outward enjoyments and performances. Nor can we too earnestly guard against those who oppose or abuse the doctrine of free salvation. If the apostle would have gloried and trusted in the flesh, he had as much cause as any man. But the things which he counted gain while a Pharisee, and had reckoned up, those he counted loss for Christ. The apostle did not persuade them to do any thing but what he himself did; or to venture on any thing but that on which he himself ventured his never-dying soul. He deemed all these things to be but loss, compared with the knowledge of Christ, by faith in his person and salvation. He speaks of all worldly enjoyments and outward privileges which sought a place with Christ in his heart, or could pretend to any merit and desert, and counted them but loss; but it might be said, It is easy to say so; but what would he do when he came to the trial? He had suffered the loss of all for the privileges of a Christian. Nay, he not only counted them loss, but the vilest refuse, offals thrown to dogs; not only less valuable than Christ, but in the highest degree contemptible, when set up as against him. True knowledge of Christ alters and changes men, their judgments and manners, and makes them as if made again anew. The believer prefers Christ, knowing that it is better for us to be without all worldly riches, than without Christ and his word. Let us see what the apostle resolved to cleave to, and that was Christ and heaven. We are undone, without righteousness wherein to appear before God, for we are guilty. There is a righteousness provided for us in Jesus Christ, and it is a complete and perfect righteousness. None can have benefit by it, who trust in themselves. Faith is the appointed means of applying the saving benefit. It is by faith in Christ's blood. We are made conformable to Christ's death, when we die to sin, as he died for sin; and the world is crucified to us, and we to the world, by the cross of Christ. The apostle was willing to do or to suffer any thing, to attain the glorious resurrection of saints. This hope and prospect carried him through all difficulties in his work. He did not hope to attain it through his own merit and righteousness, but through the merit and righteousness of Jesus Christ.</body></html>
