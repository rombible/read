It should be, <span class= "ital">who shall change the fashion of the body of our humiliation, to be conformed to the body of His glory.</span> (1) On the difference between "fashion" and "form," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-7.htm" title="But made himself of no reputation, and took on him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:">Philippians 2:7-8</a>. The contrast here signifies that humiliation is but the outward fashion or vesture of the body; the likeness to Christ is, and will be seen to be, its essential and characteristic nature. This "humiliation" marks our condition in this life, as fallen from our true humanity under the bondage of sin and death. The body is not really "vile," though it is fallen and degraded. (2) "His glory" is His glorified human nature, as it was after the Resurrection, as it is now in His ascended majesty, as it shall be seen at His second coming. What it is and will be we gather from the sublime descriptions of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/1-13.htm" title="And in the middle of the seven candlesticks one like to the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the breasts with a golden girdle.">Revelation 1:13-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/19-12.htm" title="His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.">Revelation 19:12-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-11.htm" title="And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.">Revelation 20:11</a>. What is here briefly described as change to conformity with that glory is worked out in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-42.htm" title="So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:">1Corinthians 15:42-44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-53.htm" title="For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.">1Corinthians 15:53-54</a>, into the contrast between corruption and incorruption, dishonour and glory, weakness and power, the natural (animal) body and the spiritual body. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-18.htm" title="But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.">2Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-16.htm" title="For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.">2Corinthians 4:16</a>, we read of the beginning of glorification in the spirit here; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/4-17.htm" title="For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;">2Corinthians 4:17-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.">2Corinthians 5:1-4</a>, of the completion of "the exceeding weight of glory" in the hereafter, as glorifying also "our house which is in heaven. St. John describes that glorification with brief emphatic solemnity, "We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is," and draws out explicitly the moral which St. Paul here implies, "Every man that hath this hope purifieth himself, even as He is pure."<p><span class= "bld">According to the working . . .</span>--Properly, <span class= "ital">in virtue of the effectual working of His power to subject all things to Himself.</span> Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-19.htm" title="And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,">Ephesians 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-7.htm" title="Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the effectual working of his power.">Ephesians 3:7</a>, and Notes there. Here, as there, St. Paul speaks of His power as not dormant or existing in mere capacity, but as energetic in working, unhasting and unresting. Here briefly, as more fully in the celebrated passage of the First Epistle to the Corinthians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-24.htm" title="Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1Corinthians 15:24-28</a>) he describes it as "subduing all things unto Himself," till the consummation of this universal conquest in the Last Judgment and the delivery of "the kingdom to God, even the Father . . . that God may be all in all." Of that power the primary exhibition, in which He is pleased to delight, is in salvation, gradually preparing His own for heaven; the secondary exhibition, undertaken under a moral necessity, is in retributive judgment. It is of the former only that St. Paul speaks here, as it shall be made perfect in the resurrection unto eternal life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation</span>, <span class="accented">that it may be conformed to the body of his glory.</span> Compare the description of our Lord's person and work in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-8</a>. There St. Paul tells us that he who was originally in the form of God took upon him the form of a servant, and was found in fashion as a man. Here he uses the derivatives of the same words "form" and "fashion" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), to describe the change of the bodies of the saved at the resurrection. He had already told us (ver. 10) that the Christian soul is being gradually conformed during life unto the death of Christ. He now tells us that this conformity of the Christian unto Christ is ultimately to extend to the body. The Lord shall change the outward fashion of our body; but this change will be more than a change of outward fashion: it will result in a real conformity of the resurrection-body of the believer unto the glorious body of the Lord. <span class="accented">The body of our humiliation</span>; not "vile body." St. Paul does not despise the body, like the Stoics and Gnostics; the Christian's body is a sacred thing - it is the temple of the Holy Ghost, and the seed of the resurrection-body (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">According to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself</span>. According to the working, the energy, of his power not only to change and glorify the bodies of the redeemed, but also to subdue all things, the whole universe, unto himself. "The apostle shows," says Chrysostom, "greater works of the Savior's power, that thou mightest believe in these." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-21 This simple dependence and earnestness of soul, were not mentioned as if the apostle had gained the prize, or were already made perfect in the Saviour's likeness. He forgot the things which were behind, so as not to be content with past labours or present measures of grace. He reached forth, stretched himself forward towards his point; expressions showing great concern to become more and more like unto Christ. He who runs a race, must never stop short of the end, but press forward as fast as he can; so those who have heaven in their view, must still press forward to it, in holy desires and hopes, and constant endeavours. Eternal life is the gift of God, but it is in Christ Jesus; through his hand it must come to us, as it is procured for us by him. There is no getting to heaven as our home, but by Christ as our Way. True believers, in seeking this assurance, as well as to glorify him, will seek more nearly to resemble his sufferings and death, by dying to sin, and by crucifying the flesh with its affections and lusts. In these things there is a great difference among real Christians, but all know something of them. Believers make Christ all in all, and set their hearts upon another world. If they differ from one another, and are not of the same judgment in lesser matters, yet they must not judge one another; while they all meet now in Christ, and hope to meet shortly in heaven. Let them join in all the great things in which they are agreed, and wait for further light as to lesser things wherein they differ. The enemies of the cross of Christ mind nothing but their sensual appetites. Sin is the sinner's shame, especially when gloried in. The way of those who mind earthly things, may seem pleasant, but death and hell are at the end of it. If we choose their way, we shall share their end. The life of a Christian is in heaven, where his Head and his home are, and where he hopes to be shortly; he sets his affections upon things above; and where his heart is, there will his conversation be. There is glory kept for the bodies of the saints, in which they will appear at the resurrection. Then the body will be made glorious; not only raised again to life, but raised to great advantage. Observe the power by which this change will be wrought. May we be always prepared for the coming of our Judge; looking to have our vile bodies changed by his Almighty power, and applying to him daily to new-create our souls unto holiness; to deliver us from our enemies, and to employ our bodies and souls as instruments of righteousness in his service.</body></html>
