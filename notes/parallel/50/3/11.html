The apostle uses the language of humble expectation. For the particles, "if by any means" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-12.htm">Acts 27:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-10.htm">Romans 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-14.htm">Romans 11:14</a>. The verb "attain" means to arrive at the end of a journey; it presents the figure of a pilgrimage. Read, with R.V. and the best manuscripts, <span class="accented">the resurrection from the dead.</span> This phrase (used also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-35.htm">Luke 20:35</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-2.htm">Acts 4:2</a>) means the resurrection of the <span class="accented">blessed</span> dead (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>). This meaning is strengthened here by the repetition of the preposition with the word "resurrection" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>). The general resurrection is always called the resurrection <span class="accented">of</span> the dead. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-11 Sincere Christians rejoice in Christ Jesus. The prophet calls the false prophets dumb dogs, Isa 56:10; to which the apostle seems to refer. Dogs, for their malice against faithful professors of the gospel of Christ, barking at them and biting them. They urged human works in opposition to the faith of Christ; but Paul calls them evil-workers. He calls them the concision; as they rent the church of Christ, and cut it to pieces. The work of religion is to no purpose, unless the heart is in it, and we must worship God in the strength and grace of the Divine Spirit. They rejoice in Christ Jesus, not in mere outward enjoyments and performances. Nor can we too earnestly guard against those who oppose or abuse the doctrine of free salvation. If the apostle would have gloried and trusted in the flesh, he had as much cause as any man. But the things which he counted gain while a Pharisee, and had reckoned up, those he counted loss for Christ. The apostle did not persuade them to do any thing but what he himself did; or to venture on any thing but that on which he himself ventured his never-dying soul. He deemed all these things to be but loss, compared with the knowledge of Christ, by faith in his person and salvation. He speaks of all worldly enjoyments and outward privileges which sought a place with Christ in his heart, or could pretend to any merit and desert, and counted them but loss; but it might be said, It is easy to say so; but what would he do when he came to the trial? He had suffered the loss of all for the privileges of a Christian. Nay, he not only counted them loss, but the vilest refuse, offals thrown to dogs; not only less valuable than Christ, but in the highest degree contemptible, when set up as against him. True knowledge of Christ alters and changes men, their judgments and manners, and makes them as if made again anew. The believer prefers Christ, knowing that it is better for us to be without all worldly riches, than without Christ and his word. Let us see what the apostle resolved to cleave to, and that was Christ and heaven. We are undone, without righteousness wherein to appear before God, for we are guilty. There is a righteousness provided for us in Jesus Christ, and it is a complete and perfect righteousness. None can have benefit by it, who trust in themselves. Faith is the appointed means of applying the saving benefit. It is by faith in Christ's blood. We are made conformable to Christ's death, when we die to sin, as he died for sin; and the world is crucified to us, and we to the world, by the cross of Christ. The apostle was willing to do or to suffer any thing, to attain the glorious resurrection of saints. This hope and prospect carried him through all difficulties in his work. He did not hope to attain it through his own merit and righteousness, but through the merit and righteousness of Jesus Christ.</body></html>
