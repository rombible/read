(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-15.htm" title="Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing you be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you.">Philippians 3:15</a>.) Not only does St. Paul refuse to count that he has ever yet "attained;" he will not allow that he is yet in a position even to grasp at the prize. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-27.htm" title="But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.">1Corinthians 9:27</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Forgetting those things which are behind . . .</span>--The precept is absolutely general, applying to past blessings, past achievements, even past sins. The ineradicable instinct of hope, which the wisdom of the world (not unreasonably if this life be all) holds to be a delusion, or at best a condescension to weakness, is sanctioned in the gospel as an anticipation of immortality. Accordingly hope is made a rational principle, and is always declared to be, not only a privilege, but a high Christian duty, co-ordinate with faith and love (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-13.htm" title="And now stays faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.">1Corinthians 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-4.htm" title="There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling;">Ephesians 4:4</a>). St. Paul does not scruple to say that, if we have it not, for the next life as well as this, we Christians are "of all men most miserable" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-19.htm" title="If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.">1Corinthians 15:19</a>). Hence past blessing is but an earnest of the future; past achievements of good are stepping-stones to greater things; past sins are viewed in that true repentance which differs from remorse--"the sorrow of this world which worketh death" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-10.htm" title="For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world works death.">2Corinthians 7:10</a>)--in having a sure and certain hope of the final conquest of all sin. The "eternal life" in Christ is a present gift, but one test of its reality in the present is its possession of the promise of the future.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended</span>; rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">I reckon.</span> Two of the best manuscripts read "not yet" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span>). The pronouns are emphatic: whatever others may think of me or of themselves, "I reckon not <span class="accented">myself to</span> have apprehended." <span class="cmt_word">But this one thing</span>. The ellipse here is forcible; some supply "I reckon;" others, "I say;" others, as A.V., "I do," which seems best suited to the context. <span class="cmt_word">I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before</span>. St. Paul concentrates all his thoughts and all his energies on the one great end of life, the one thing needful. He forgets those things which are behind; that is, not, as some explain, his Jewish privileges and distinctions, but that part of his Christian race already past. So Chrysostom, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f60;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>; <span class="accented">Reaching forth.</span> The Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>; is singularly emphatic: it means that the athlete throws himself forward in the race with all his energies strained to the very utmost. Compare Bengel, "Oculus manum, manus pedem praevertit et trahit." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-21 This simple dependence and earnestness of soul, were not mentioned as if the apostle had gained the prize, or were already made perfect in the Saviour's likeness. He forgot the things which were behind, so as not to be content with past labours or present measures of grace. He reached forth, stretched himself forward towards his point; expressions showing great concern to become more and more like unto Christ. He who runs a race, must never stop short of the end, but press forward as fast as he can; so those who have heaven in their view, must still press forward to it, in holy desires and hopes, and constant endeavours. Eternal life is the gift of God, but it is in Christ Jesus; through his hand it must come to us, as it is procured for us by him. There is no getting to heaven as our home, but by Christ as our Way. True believers, in seeking this assurance, as well as to glorify him, will seek more nearly to resemble his sufferings and death, by dying to sin, and by crucifying the flesh with its affections and lusts. In these things there is a great difference among real Christians, but all know something of them. Believers make Christ all in all, and set their hearts upon another world. If they differ from one another, and are not of the same judgment in lesser matters, yet they must not judge one another; while they all meet now in Christ, and hope to meet shortly in heaven. Let them join in all the great things in which they are agreed, and wait for further light as to lesser things wherein they differ. The enemies of the cross of Christ mind nothing but their sensual appetites. Sin is the sinner's shame, especially when gloried in. The way of those who mind earthly things, may seem pleasant, but death and hell are at the end of it. If we choose their way, we shall share their end. The life of a Christian is in heaven, where his Head and his home are, and where he hopes to be shortly; he sets his affections upon things above; and where his heart is, there will his conversation be. There is glory kept for the bodies of the saints, in which they will appear at the resurrection. Then the body will be made glorious; not only raised again to life, but raised to great advantage. Observe the power by which this change will be wrought. May we be always prepared for the coming of our Judge; looking to have our vile bodies changed by his Almighty power, and applying to him daily to new-create our souls unto holiness; to deliver us from our enemies, and to employ our bodies and souls as instruments of righteousness in his service.</body></html>
