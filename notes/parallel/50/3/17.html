The co-existence of these two parties was, it may be remarked, a feature of the Gnosticism already beginning to show itself in the Church. He deals with this perversion of liberty into licentiousness in exactly the same spirit as in Romans 6, but with greater brevity; with less of argument and more of grave condemnation. It stands, indeed, he says, self-condemned, by the very fact of our present citizenship in heaven, and our growth towards the future perfection of likeness to Christ in glory.<p>(17) <span class= "bld">Followers together of me.</span>--The word is peculiar. It signifies <span class= "ital">unite in following me.</span> In accordance with the genius of the whole Epistle, St. Paul offers his example as a help not only to rectitude but to unity. For the simple phrase "followers of me," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-16.htm" title="Why I beseech you, be you followers of me.">1Corinthians 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-1.htm" title="Be you followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.">1Corinthians 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm" title="And you became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.">1Thessalonians 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-9.htm" title="Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample to you to follow us.">2Thessalonians 3:9</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-1.htm" title="Be you followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.">1Corinthians 11:1</a>, a passage dealing with the right restraints of Christian liberty, we have the ground on which the exhortation is based, "Be ye followers of me, <span class= "ital">even as I also am of Christ."</span> In that consciousness, knowing the peculiar power of example, both for teaching and for encouragement, St. Paul will not allow even humility to prevent his bringing it to bear upon them. Yet even then we note how gladly he escapes from "followers <span class= "ital">of me"</span> to the "having <span class= "ital">us</span> for an example."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">imitators together.</span> They are to unite, one and all, in imitating him. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-1.htm">1 Corinthians 11:1</a> he gives the ground of this advice, "As I also am of Christ." <span class="accented">Mark</span>, here in order to imitate; elsewhere (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-17.htm">Romans 16:17</a>) in order to avoid. He changes the singular number to the plural, modestly shrinking from proposing himself alone as their example. But "ensample" is still singular, because they all (Timothy, Epaphroditus, etc.) present the same image, all imitating Christ. Observe the change of metaphor: hitherto the Christian life has been compared to a race; now he speaks of walking; literally, <span class="accented">walking about</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>), moving hither and thither in the daily path of life. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-21 This simple dependence and earnestness of soul, were not mentioned as if the apostle had gained the prize, or were already made perfect in the Saviour's likeness. He forgot the things which were behind, so as not to be content with past labours or present measures of grace. He reached forth, stretched himself forward towards his point; expressions showing great concern to become more and more like unto Christ. He who runs a race, must never stop short of the end, but press forward as fast as he can; so those who have heaven in their view, must still press forward to it, in holy desires and hopes, and constant endeavours. Eternal life is the gift of God, but it is in Christ Jesus; through his hand it must come to us, as it is procured for us by him. There is no getting to heaven as our home, but by Christ as our Way. True believers, in seeking this assurance, as well as to glorify him, will seek more nearly to resemble his sufferings and death, by dying to sin, and by crucifying the flesh with its affections and lusts. In these things there is a great difference among real Christians, but all know something of them. Believers make Christ all in all, and set their hearts upon another world. If they differ from one another, and are not of the same judgment in lesser matters, yet they must not judge one another; while they all meet now in Christ, and hope to meet shortly in heaven. Let them join in all the great things in which they are agreed, and wait for further light as to lesser things wherein they differ. The enemies of the cross of Christ mind nothing but their sensual appetites. Sin is the sinner's shame, especially when gloried in. The way of those who mind earthly things, may seem pleasant, but death and hell are at the end of it. If we choose their way, we shall share their end. The life of a Christian is in heaven, where his Head and his home are, and where he hopes to be shortly; he sets his affections upon things above; and where his heart is, there will his conversation be. There is glory kept for the bodies of the saints, in which they will appear at the resurrection. Then the body will be made glorious; not only raised again to life, but raised to great advantage. Observe the power by which this change will be wrought. May we be always prepared for the coming of our Judge; looking to have our vile bodies changed by his Almighty power, and applying to him daily to new-create our souls unto holiness; to deliver us from our enemies, and to employ our bodies and souls as instruments of righteousness in his service.</body></html>
