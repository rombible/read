But both the grammatical form and the ordinary usage of the word (not elsewhere found in the New Testament) point to the former sense; which is also far better accordant with the general wording of the passage. For the word "is" is the emphatic word, which signifies "actually exists"; and the reference to the appearance of the Lord Jesus Christ is obviously suggested by the thought that with it will also come the manifestation of the "Jerusalem which is above . . . the mother of us all" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-26.htm" title="But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.">Galatians 4:26</a>); as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm" title="And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.">Revelation 21:2</a>, "I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from heaven." The force of the passage would, however, in either case be much the same. "Their mind is on earth; our country is in heaven," and to it our affections cling, even during our earthly pilgrimage. It is impossible not to remember the famous words of Plato of his <span class= "ital">Divine Republic, </span>"In heaven, perhaps, the embodiment of it is stored up for any one who wills to see it, and seeing it, to claim his place therein" (<span class= "ital">Rep.</span> ix., p. 592B). But the infinite difference between the shadowy republic of the philosopher, to which each has to rise, if he can, by his own spiritual power, and the well-centred "kingdom of God," is suggested by the very words that follow here. The kingdom is real, because there is a real King, who has given us a place there, who will one day be manifested to take us home. It should be noted that the city is spoken of as ours already. As all the citizens of Philippi, the Roman colony, were citizens of the far distant imperial city, so the Philippian Christians even now were citizens of the better country in heaven. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-19.htm" title="Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;">Ephesians 2:19</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">We look for.</span>--Properly, <span class= "ital">we eagerly wait for.</span> The word is a peculiar and striking expression of longing, found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-19.htm" title="For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.">Romans 8:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-28.htm" title="And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.">Romans 8:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-25.htm" title="But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.">Romans 8:25</a>, "The earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God" (where see Note).<p><span class= "bld">The Saviour.</span>--The title is emphatic in relation to the hope of perfected salvation which follows. But we note that the use of the word "Saviour" by St. Paul is peculiar to the later Epistles, and especially frequent in the Pastoral Epistles. It is found also again and again in the Second Epistle of Peter.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For our conversation is in heaven</span>. The word "our" is emphatic; the apostle refers back to ver. 17: "Follow us, not those enemies of the cross; <span class="accented">our</span> conversation is in heaven; <span class="accented">they</span> mind earthly things." The A.V. has this same word "conversation" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>, where the Greek (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) is the verb corresponding with the noun (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x39c;&#x3b1;</span>) which occurs here. The verb is used in the sense of a certain mode of life or conversation, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-1.htm">Acts 23:1</a>, but it does not appear that the noun ever bears that meaning. The rendering" citizenship" also seems deficient in authority. In classical Greek the word has three meanings: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a form of government; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> political acts, politics; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> a commonwealth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The last seems the most suitable here. The unworthy Christians mentioned in the last verse mind earthly things; but our city, our country, our home, is in heaven: there is the state of which we are citizens; there is the general assembly and Church of the Firstborn, whoso names are inscribed in the roll of the citizens of the heavenly city. Our real home is there <span class="accented">now</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>, "Ye are no longer strangers and foreigners, but ye <span class="accented">are</span> fellow-citizens of the saints" (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-10.htm">Hebrews 11:10, 16</a> and Hebrews 13:14; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-26.htm">Galatians 4:26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From whence also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ</span>; rather, we <span class="accented">eagerly wait for</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-5.htm">Galatians 5:5</a>) t<span class="accented">he Lord Jesus Christ as a Savior</span>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-9.htm">Isaiah 25:9</a>, "This is the Lord; we have waited for him; we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-21 This simple dependence and earnestness of soul, were not mentioned as if the apostle had gained the prize, or were already made perfect in the Saviour's likeness. He forgot the things which were behind, so as not to be content with past labours or present measures of grace. He reached forth, stretched himself forward towards his point; expressions showing great concern to become more and more like unto Christ. He who runs a race, must never stop short of the end, but press forward as fast as he can; so those who have heaven in their view, must still press forward to it, in holy desires and hopes, and constant endeavours. Eternal life is the gift of God, but it is in Christ Jesus; through his hand it must come to us, as it is procured for us by him. There is no getting to heaven as our home, but by Christ as our Way. True believers, in seeking this assurance, as well as to glorify him, will seek more nearly to resemble his sufferings and death, by dying to sin, and by crucifying the flesh with its affections and lusts. In these things there is a great difference among real Christians, but all know something of them. Believers make Christ all in all, and set their hearts upon another world. If they differ from one another, and are not of the same judgment in lesser matters, yet they must not judge one another; while they all meet now in Christ, and hope to meet shortly in heaven. Let them join in all the great things in which they are agreed, and wait for further light as to lesser things wherein they differ. The enemies of the cross of Christ mind nothing but their sensual appetites. Sin is the sinner's shame, especially when gloried in. The way of those who mind earthly things, may seem pleasant, but death and hell are at the end of it. If we choose their way, we shall share their end. The life of a Christian is in heaven, where his Head and his home are, and where he hopes to be shortly; he sets his affections upon things above; and where his heart is, there will his conversation be. There is glory kept for the bodies of the saints, in which they will appear at the resurrection. Then the body will be made glorious; not only raised again to life, but raised to great advantage. Observe the power by which this change will be wrought. May we be always prepared for the coming of our Judge; looking to have our vile bodies changed by his Almighty power, and applying to him daily to new-create our souls unto holiness; to deliver us from our enemies, and to employ our bodies and souls as instruments of righteousness in his service.</body></html>
