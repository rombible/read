So St. Paul made it to the Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-20.htm" title="For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.">Acts 28:20</a>), "For the hope of Israel am I bound in this chain." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-20.htm" title="For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.">Ephesians 6:20</a>, "I am an ambassador in bonds.")<p><span class= "bld">In all the palace, and in all other places.</span>--The word "palace" is <span class= "ital">praetorium.</span> It is elsewhere used in the New Testament: first, of the palace of Pilate; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-27.htm" title="Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered to him the whole band of soldiers.">Matthew 27:27</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-16.htm" title="And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.">Mark 15:16</a>, apparently, of the soldiers' guardroom, or barrack; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-28.htm" title="Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas to the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.">John 18:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-33.htm" title="Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?">John 18:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-9.htm" title="And went again into the judgment hall, and said to Jesus, From where are you? But Jesus gave him no answer.">John 19:9</a>, of "the hall of judgment;" and next in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-35.htm" title="I will hear you, said he, when your accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.">Acts 23:35</a>, of the "judgment hall of Herod," evidently forming a part of the palace of Felix. (It may be noted that coincidence with this last passage is the chief, and almost the sole, argument for the untenable idea that this Epistle belongs to the Caesarean and not the Roman captivity.) Its sense here has been disputed. It has been variously interpreted as the emperor's palace, or the praetorian barrack attached to it, or the praetorian camp outside the walls. Its original meaning of "the head-quarters of a general" would lend itself well enough to any of these, as a derivative sense. The first or the second sense (which is virtually the same) is the interpretation of all ancient commentators, and suits best with the mention of "Caesar's household" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-22.htm" title="All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.">Philippians 4:22</a>, but not very well with the historical statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/28-16.htm" title="And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.">Acts 28:16-30</a>, that St. Paul dwelt "in his own hired house," "with a soldier that kept him." The other sense suits better with this last statement, and also with the delivery of the prisoner "to the captain of the guard," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>literally, <span class= "ital">the commander of the camp, </span>or <span class= "ital">praetorian prefect, </span>and perhaps with abstract probability in the case of an obscure Jewish prisoner. But the difficulty is that, although the word might be applied to any of these places, yet, as a matter of fact, it is not found to be so applied. Moreover, we notice here that the words "in all other places" are an inaccurate rendering of a phrase really meaning "to all the rest" (see marginal reading). The connection therefore seems even in itself to suggest that the "praetorium" may more properly refer to a body of men than to a place. Accordingly (following Dr. Lightfoot), since the word "praetorium" is undoubtedly used for the "praetorian guard," it seems best to take that sense here. "My bonds" (says the Apostle) "are known in all the praetorian regiments"--for the soldiers, no doubt, guarded him by turns--"and to all the rest of the world, whether of soldiers or of citizens." This would leave it an open question where St. Paul was imprisoned, only telling us that it was under praetorian surveillance;<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So that my bonds in Christ are manifest</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">so that my bonds became manifest in Christ.</span> At first he seemed like ether prisoners; afterwards it became known that he suffered bonds, not for any crime, but in Christ, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in fellowship with Christ and in consequence of the relation in which he stood to Christ. <span class="cmt_word">In all the palace; rather</span>, as R.V., <span class="accented">throughout the whole Praetorian Guard</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in the whole praetorium</span>, The word elsewhere means a governor's house: Pilate's house in the Gospels, Herod's palace in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-35.htm">Acts 23:35</a>. But at Rome the name so used would give unnecessary offense, and there is no proof that it was ever used for the palatium there. St. Paul must have heard it constantly as the name of the Praetorian regiment; he was kept chained to a soldier of that corps (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-16.htm">Acts 28:16</a>); and as his guard was continually relieved, his name and sufferings for Christ would become gradually known throughout the force. Others, on the authority of a passage in Dion Cassius, understand the word of the barracks of that part of the Praetorian guard attached to the imperial residence on the Palatine. But the passage relates to the time of Augustus, before the Praetorian cohorts were established by Tiberius in the camp outside of the Colline Gate. <span class="cmt_word">And in all other places</span>; rather, as R.V. <span class="accented">and to all the rest</span>; generally, that is, throughout the city. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-20 The apostle was a prisoner at Rome; and to take off the offence of the cross, he shows the wisdom and goodness of God in his sufferings. These things made him known, where he would never have otherwise been known; and led some to inquire after the gospel. He suffered from false friends, as well as from enemies. How wretched the temper of those who preached Christ out of envy and contention, and to add affliction to the bonds that oppressed this best of men! The apostle was easy in the midst of all. Since our troubles may tend to the good of many, we ought to rejoice. Whatever turns to our salvation, is by the Spirit of Christ; and prayer is the appointed means of seeking for it. Our earnest expectation and hope should not be to be honoured of men, or to escape the cross, but to be upheld amidst temptation, contempt, and affliction. Let us leave it to Christ, which way he will make us serviceable to his glory, whether by labour or suffering, by diligence or patience, by living to his honour in working for him, or dying to his honour in suffering for him.</body></html>
