Here he and Timotheus are simply "servants" (not, as in our version, "the servants" in any position of special eminence) "of Jesus Christ"--a title of humility assumed by St. James and St. Jude (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-1.htm" title="James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.">James 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-1.htm" title="Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:">Jude 1:1</a>), but nowhere else by St. Paul without the addition of some title of apostolic authority. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated to the gospel of God,">Romans 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;">Titus 1:1</a>.) Even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-10.htm" title="For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.">Galatians 1:10</a> he declares that he is "the servant of Christ," chiefly to show that he cannot and need not "please men." It is to be noted also that here, as again (with Silas) in the Thessalonian Epistles, Timotheus is joined with St. Paul almost on a footing of equality whereas in other Epistles (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:">2Corinthians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-1.htm" title=" Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,">Colossians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow laborer,">Philemon 1:1</a>), he is separated from the Apostle and distinguished as "Timotheus the brother." This is probably to be accounted for partly by the absence of all necessity for assertion of his own apostleship, partly also by the fact that (with Silas) Timotheus was St. Paul's fellow-worker in the conversion of the Macedonian Churches, and accordingly his chosen messenger to them from time to time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-22.htm" title="So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered to him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.">Acts 19:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-5.htm" title="These going before tarried for us at Troas.">Acts 20:5</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The saints in Christ Jesus.</span>--The same expression is used in the salutations which commence other Epistles of this period (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:">Ephesians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-1.htm" title=" Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,">Colossians 1:1</a>): "the saints and faithful in Christ Jesus."<p><span class= "bld">With the bishops and deacons.</span>--In this passage the word "bishop" is, for the first time, used as a title, although in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a> ("over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers") it is employed as a description of duty, with a distinct reference to its etymological meaning and origin. In the Pastoral Epistles we find it similarly used (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm" title="A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach;">1Timothy 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-7.htm" title="For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;">Titus 1:7</a>). There is now no question--and but for supposed ecclesiastical necessities there never could have been any question--that in Holy Scripture, as also in the First Epistle of an Apostolical Father (<span class= "ital">St. Clement to</span> <span class= "ital">the</span> <span class= "ital">Corinthians, </span>Php. 19), the two titles of "bishop" and "presbyter" are applied to the same persons--the latter, however, being in St. Paul's Epistles the more frequent and conventional term, while the former seems almost always used with reference to its actual meaning. The two titles are of diverse origin. The "presbyter," or "elder," is a Jewish title, so directly descended from the synagogue that the institution of the presbyterate is not, like that of the diaconate, recorded as a historical creation in the Church. The title of "bishop," or "overseer," is of heathen origin, used in classical Greek for a commissioner from head-quarters, applied in the LXX. to various secular offices (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-19.htm" title="And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.">2Kings 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/24-12.htm" title="And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as worked iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.">2Chronicles 24:12-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-9.htm" title="And Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer: and Judah the son of Senuah was second over the city.">Nehemiah 11:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-14.htm" title="And their brothers, mighty men of valor, an hundred twenty and eight: and their overseer was Zabdiel, the son of one of the great men.">Nehemiah 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-22.htm" title="The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micha. Of the sons of Asaph, the singers were over the business of the house of God.">Nehemiah 11:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-17.htm" title="For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make your officers peace, and your exactors righteousness.">Isaiah 60:17</a>). The former is simply a title of dignity, like the many derivations from the Latin <span class= "ital">senior</span> which have passed into modern language. The latter is a title of official duty. Like the word "pastor" and "apostle," it belongs properly only to the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the "Apostle of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-1.htm" title="Why, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;">Hebrews 3:1</a>), and "the Shepherd and Bishop of our souls" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-25.htm" title="For you were as sheep going astray; but are now returned to the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.">1Peter 2:25</a>); but derivatively to His ministers, as having the oversight of His Church. This is directly shown in the application of the title to the Ephesian presbyters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/5-1.htm" title="The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:">1Peter 5:1-2</a>), and the idea of responsible oversight is brought out clearly in the description of the office of the "bishop "in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/3-1.htm" title="This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desires a good work.">1Timothy 3:1-7</a>. The in-different use of the two names is made absolutely clear in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/titus/1-5.htm" title="For this cause left I you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed you:">Titus 1:5-7</a> : "Ordain elders in every city . . . if any be blameless . . . For a bishop must be blameless as a steward of God." It is only necessary to remark briefly that this identification of the two titles (of which St. Clement's Epistle is the last example) in no way weakens the significance of the undoubted historical fact of the development of what we call the Episcopate in the early part of the second century, and the overwhelming probability of its origination, under the sanction of St. John, when the representatives of the higher order of the Apostolate passed away.<p>The name "deacon" is also used for the first time, unless, indeed, as is probable, it is applied officially to Phoebe in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-1.htm" title="I commend to you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:">Romans 16:1</a>. Although the office of the Seven, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.">Acts 6:1-7</a>, is undoubtedly the germ of the diaconate, and although the cognate words ("ministration" and "serve") are used in connection with them (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/1-1.htm" title="Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:">Philippians 1:1-2</a>), yet the actual title of deacons is nowhere given to them.<p>This mention of the ministers as distinct from the Church in salutation is unique. It has been conjectured, with great probability, that in the Letter of the Philippian Church, which no doubt accompanied the mission of alms by Epaphroditus, the presbyters and deacons were so distinguished; as in the letter of the Council at Jerusalem, according to the ordinary reading of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-23.htm" title="And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brothers send greeting to the brothers which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.">Acts 15:23</a> ("the apostles and elders and brethren"). Some ancient authorities held that Epaphroditus was "the apostle" (or what we should call the bishop) of the Church at Philippi, and that he is not named here simply because he was with St. Paul: so that in the Philippian Church the three orders were already represented. (But on this see <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-25.htm" title="Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.">Philippians 2:25</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Paul and Timotheus</span>. St. Paul does not assume his official title in writing to the Macedonian Churches, Philippi and Thessalonica; it is used in all his other Epistles, except the short letter to Philemon. His relations to the Philippians and Thessalonians were those of the deepest personal affection; there was no need of a formal introduction, especially in an Epistle which has so little of an official character as this to the Philippians. He joins the name of Timothy with his own, as in 2 Corinthians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, and Philemon. Thus Timothy is associated with St. Paul in every Epistle in which another name is found except 1 Corinthians, where Sosthenes only is mentioned; this shows the intimate affection that bound St. Paul to his "own son in the faith." There was a special reason for mentioning Timothy in this Epistle, as he was so well known to the Philippians, and St. Paul was intending (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19</a>) to send him shortly to Philippi. But St. Paul writes in his own name from the beginning. Timothy was not in any sense a joint author; he may possibly have been St. Paul's amanuensis, as Tertius was in the case of the Epistle to the Romans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-22.htm">Romans 16:22</a>). Possibly also motives of humility led St. Paul to insert other names besides his own; but it was not to support his teaching by additional authority - he was "an apostle, not of man, neither by man," and needed not the weight of other names. <span class="cmt_word">The servants of Jesus Christ</span>; <span class="accented">slaves</span>, literally: "made free from sin and become servants [slaves] to God," whose service is perfect freedom. We belong to him: he he is our Master (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) as well as Father, we are his slaves as well as his sons: "Ye are not your own, ye are bought with a price." Compare the words of the "damsel possessed with a spirit of divination" at Philippi: "These men are the servants [slaves] of the most high God." She felt the difference between her state and theirs; she was the slave of her Philip-plan masters, of the evil spirit too; St. Paul and his companion were the slaves of God most high. In the best manuscripts, as in the R.V., "Christ" is put before "Jesus" here. The apostle frequently sets the official before the personal name of our Lord; possibly because he knew not the Lord Jesus after the flesh, but saw him first as the Messiah, the Christ of God. <span class="cmt_word">To all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi</span>. The word "all" is of very frequent occurrence in this Epistle. There may possibly be a reference to the dissensions alluded to in ch. 4:2; or, as some think, to the supplies sent for St. Paul's assistance; he addresses all alike, not only those who contributed; he does not recognize their divisions. But it is, perhaps, only the natural expression of his warm affection: the apostle was beloved by all the Philippians, and all were dear to him; there was no hostile faction there, as at Corinth and else where. Compare the affectionate repetition, "always," "every," "all," in Ver. 4. St. Paul uses the word "saint" as the general name for his converts, like "Christian." The word "Christian" occurs only three times in the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-28.htm">Acts 26:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-16.htm">1 Peter 4:16</a>). Christ's people are called "brethren," "disciples," or "saints." Thus St. Paul addresses the Corinthians generally as "saints," though many of them were far from possessing holiness of heart and life. The ancient Church was holy; the Israelites are called "a holy nation," "saints of the Most High." They were holy by God's election, his chosen people, separated unto him by the rite of circumcision. By the same election the Christian Church is holy, dedicated to God in baptism. This holiness of dedication (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-14.htm">1 Corinthians 7:14</a>) does not necessarily involve the actual existence of that inner holiness of heart "without which no man shall see the Lord." But it does imply the bounden duty of striving after that spiritual holiness. "Ye are the temple of the living God," St. Paul says to the Corinthians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>). "for God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people... <span class="accented">therefore</span>... let us cleanse ourselves from el! filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God." The Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (in our translation sometimes "holy," sometimes "saint") is the usual rendering for the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>. The primary idea of the Hebrew word seems to be that of separation - separation from all that defileth. God is "of purer eyes than to behold evil;" those who are dedicated to him must strive by his grace to purify themselves even as he is pure. "Be ye holy, for I am holy." <span class="accented">In Christ Jesus.</span> They are saints in virtue of their relation to Christ. They were once" baptized into one body" - the mystical body of Christ. Holiness of dedication can issue in holiness of heart and life only by abiding <span class="accented">in him</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-6</a>). All saints are one body in Christ; they are knit together into one communion and fellowship by their personal union with the one Lord. <span class="cmt_word">With the bishops and deacons</span>. In the New Testament the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is synonymous with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-17.htm">Acts 20:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-1.htm">1 Peter 5:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-1.htm">1 Timothy 2:1-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5-7</a>). St. Paul is addressing the elders of the Church at Philippi, not bishops in our sense of the word. It is possible that Epaphroditus may have been the presiding bishop of the Church (see notes on Philippians 2:25 and Philippians 4:3). If so, we see a reason why the second and third orders of the ministry only are mentioned, as Epaphroditus was the bearer of the Epistle. But diocesan episcopacy does not seem to have become general till the last quarter of the first century. We know that Paul and Barnabas "ordained elders in every Church" in their first missionary journey; we need not, therefore, be surprised at the mention of these official designations in this Epistle, which was written seventeen or eighteen years later. St. Paul's address to the elders of the Church at Ephesus shows the importance which he attached to the office and to the faithful performance of its duties. Perhaps "the bishops and deacons" are specially mentioned here as having collected. the contributions sent to St. Paul; so Chrysostom and Meyer. On the whole subject, see Bishop Lightfoot's exhaustive 'Dissertation on the Christian Ministry,' in his volume on the Epistle to the Philippians. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 The highest honour of the most eminent ministers is, to be servants of Christ. And those who are not really saints on earth, never will be saints in heaven. Out of Christ, the best saints are sinners, and unable to stand before God. There is no peace without grace. Inward peace springs from a sense of Divine favour. And there is no grace and peace but from God our Father, the fountain and origin of all blessings. At Philippi the apostle was evil entreated, and saw little fruit of his labour; yet he remembers Philippi with joy. We must thank our God for the graces and comforts, gifts and usefulness of others, as we receive the benefit, and God receives the glory. The work of grace will never be perfected till the day of Jesus Christ, the day of his appearance. But we may always be confident God will perform his good work, in every soul wherein he has really begun it by regeneration; though we must not trust in outward appearances, nor in any thing but a new creation to holiness. People are dear to their ministers, when they receive benefit by their ministry. Fellow-sufferers in the cause of God should be dear one to another.</body></html>
