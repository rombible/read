It is true that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-30.htm" title="Having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.">Philippians 1:30</a> he speaks of the Philippians as having themselves to undergo "the same conflict" as his own; but the expression "in my bonds, &c.," can hardly be satisfied simply by this kind of fellowship.<p><span class= "bld">Ye all are partakers of my grace.</span>--Here, on the contrary, the marginal reading is preferable. Ye <span class= "ital">are all partakers with me of the grace</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of the privilege described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm" title="To me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;">Ephesians 3:8</a>.

His love for them increases his confidence. <span class="cmt_word">Inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel</span>. These words may be taken with the preceding, "I have you in my heart during my imprisonment and defense." So Chrysostom, whose words are very striking: <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;</span>. But it is, perhaps, more natural to take them with the following. <span class="cmt_word">Ye all are partakers of my grace</span>; rather, <span class="accented">ye all are partakers with me of the grace.</span> They were partakers of the grace of God given to him in his bonds and in his work. The like grace was given to them both for the passive and active sides of the Christian life - both in endurance of suffering and in propagating the gospel. Thus there seems to be no reference in the words "defense and confirmation" to his public defense before Caesar (which probably had not yet taken place), but generally to his work of preaching the gospel, which was both apologetic, meeting the objections of adversaries, and aggressive, asserting the truth. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 The highest honour of the most eminent ministers is, to be servants of Christ. And those who are not really saints on earth, never will be saints in heaven. Out of Christ, the best saints are sinners, and unable to stand before God. There is no peace without grace. Inward peace springs from a sense of Divine favour. And there is no grace and peace but from God our Father, the fountain and origin of all blessings. At Philippi the apostle was evil entreated, and saw little fruit of his labour; yet he remembers Philippi with joy. We must thank our God for the graces and comforts, gifts and usefulness of others, as we receive the benefit, and God receives the glory. The work of grace will never be perfected till the day of Jesus Christ, the day of his appearance. But we may always be confident God will perform his good work, in every soul wherein he has really begun it by regeneration; though we must not trust in outward appearances, nor in any thing but a new creation to holiness. People are dear to their ministers, when they receive benefit by their ministry. Fellow-sufferers in the cause of God should be dear one to another.</body></html>
