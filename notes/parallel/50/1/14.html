As connected with the word "brethren," they are unmeaning; whereas St. Paul constantly uses them (especially in these Epistles), generally with a verb or verbal adjective, and always to convey some distinct idea. That the words "in my bonds" follow constitutes no difficulty. "In the Lord" expresses the ground of confidence; "in my bonds" simply the occasion and circumstances.<p><span class= "bld">Waxing confident by my bonds.</span>--There is a two-fold sense here, corresponding to the two-fold division of preachers made below. Those who preached Christ "of contention" trusted in St. Paul's captivity as giving them scope; those who preached "of good will" found in it a striking example of evil overruled to good, and so gained from it fresh encouragement.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And many of the brethren in the Lord</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and that most.</span> Most of the brethren took courage; there were exceptions<span class="cmt_word">. Waxing confident by my bonds</span>. The words, "in the Lord," are perhaps better taken with being "confident." Their confidence rests upon St. Paul's bonds, but it is in the Lord. St. Paul's example gives them courage, because they know that he is suffering for the love of Christ, and is supported in his sufferings by the grace of Christ. Are much more bold to speak the word without fear; better, more <span class="accented">abundantly</span>, as R.V. The best manuscripts read here, "the Word of God." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-20 The apostle was a prisoner at Rome; and to take off the offence of the cross, he shows the wisdom and goodness of God in his sufferings. These things made him known, where he would never have otherwise been known; and led some to inquire after the gospel. He suffered from false friends, as well as from enemies. How wretched the temper of those who preached Christ out of envy and contention, and to add affliction to the bonds that oppressed this best of men! The apostle was easy in the midst of all. Since our troubles may tend to the good of many, we ought to rejoice. Whatever turns to our salvation, is by the Spirit of Christ; and prayer is the appointed means of seeking for it. Our earnest expectation and hope should not be to be honoured of men, or to escape the cross, but to be upheld amidst temptation, contempt, and affliction. Let us leave it to Christ, which way he will make us serviceable to his glory, whether by labour or suffering, by diligence or patience, by living to his honour in working for him, or dying to his honour in suffering for him.</body></html>
