It is simply, "I feel certain;" and it is obvious to remark that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-25.htm" title="And now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.">Acts 20:25</a> it is used by St. Paul of a conviction (that he would "see the face" of the Ephesians "no more") which, so far as we can follow out the history, was not verified. The apostolic inspiration, like the apostolic power of miracle, was a gift relative to the apostolic work, not necessarily extending beyond it.<p><span class= "bld">Abide and continue with you.</span>--The latter verb is in the original a compound of the former, "I shall abide," and "shall abide side by side with you." It was for their sakes that it was needful for him to live. Hence to the simple idea "I shall abide," it was natural to add at once the phrase "with you," or "for you," as explaining the very object of his abiding in the flesh.<p><span class= "bld">For your furtherance and joy of faith.</span>--In these words St. Paul's presence with them is spoken of, first, as in some degree necessary for their spiritual advance; next, as being to them a gift of God for their joy and comfort, even beyond what was actually necessary. (See the next verse.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all</span>. Being persuaded of this, that my life is needful for you; or, as others render, "And this I certainly, confidently know." The first translation seems preferable, for St. Paul's assurance does not seem to rest on direct inspiration, but on a calculation of probabilities. The apostles could not always foresee their own future (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-22.htm">Acts 20:22</a>). Bishop Lightfoot says, "The same word <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span> is used <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-25.htm">Acts 20:25</a>, where he expresses his belief that he shall not see his Asiatic converts again. Viewed as infallible presentiments, the two are hardly reconcilable; for the one assumes, the other negatives, his release. The assurance here recorded was fulfilled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>); while the presentiment there expressed was overruled by events (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-15.htm">2 Timothy 1:15, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-20.htm">2 Timothy 4:20</a>)." <span class="cmt_word">For your furtherance and joy of faith</span>; for the progress and joy of your faith, that you may continually increase in faith and take delight in it. Joy is the key-note of this Epistle. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:21-26 Death is a great loss to a carnal, worldly man, for he loses all his earthly comforts and all his hopes; but to a true believer it is gain, for it is the end of all his weakness and misery. It delivers him from all the evils of life, and brings him to possess the chief good. The apostle's difficulty was not between living in this world and living in heaven; between these two there is no comparison; but between serving Christ in this world and enjoying him in another. Not between two evil things, but between two good things; living to Christ and being with him. See the power of faith and of Divine grace; it can make us willing to die. In this world we are compassed with sin; but when with Christ, we shall escape sin and temptation, sorrow and death, for ever. But those who have most reason to desire to depart, should be willing to remain in the world as long as God has any work for them to do. And the more unexpected mercies are before they come, the more of God will be seen in them.</body></html>
