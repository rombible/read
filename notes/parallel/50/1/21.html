The opposition in the passage is between the states of living and dying (or being dead), not between the principles of life and death. It is, therefore, in some sense distinct from the cognate passages--<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/3-3.htm" title=" For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.">Colossians 3:3-4</a>, "Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. . . . Christ is our life;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>, "I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me." Those passages set forth the cause; this the result. If Christ be the principle of life in us, then whatever we think and say and do, exhibiting visibly that inner life, must be the manifestation of Christ.<p><span class= "bld">To die is gain.</span>--This follows from the other. Death is a new stage in the progress of union with Christ. So we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/5-6.htm" title="Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:">2Corinthians 5:6-7</a>, "Knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord . . . we are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord." "To depart" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-23.htm" title="For I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:">Philippians 1:23</a>) is, in a higher sense than can be realised here, "to be with Christ."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain</span>. Others, as Calvin, render (not so well), "For to me Christ is gain both in life and in death." The alternative suggested in Ver. 20 leads St. Paul to a short digression on the comparative advantages of life and death; he is content with either. Life is blessed, for it is Christ; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-4.htm">Colossians 2:4</a>, "Christ, who is our Life," and Galatians it. 20, "Not I, but Christ liveth in me;" "Quit-quid rive, Christum vivo" (Bengel). The life of Christ lives, breathes, energizes, in the life of his saints. His flesh, his incarnate life is their meat; his blood, the mystery of his atonement, is the drink of their souls. He abideth in them, and they in him. And yet death is gain; the slate of death, not the act of dying, is meant (the infinitive is aorist, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>), for the dead in Christ are at home with the Lord (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) in a far more blessed sense than the saints on earth. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:21-26 Death is a great loss to a carnal, worldly man, for he loses all his earthly comforts and all his hopes; but to a true believer it is gain, for it is the end of all his weakness and misery. It delivers him from all the evils of life, and brings him to possess the chief good. The apostle's difficulty was not between living in this world and living in heaven; between these two there is no comparison; but between serving Christ in this world and enjoying him in another. Not between two evil things, but between two good things; living to Christ and being with him. See the power of faith and of Divine grace; it can make us willing to die. In this world we are compassed with sin; but when with Christ, we shall escape sin and temptation, sorrow and death, for ever. But those who have most reason to desire to depart, should be willing to remain in the world as long as God has any work for them to do. And the more unexpected mercies are before they come, the more of God will be seen in them.</body></html>
