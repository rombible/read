It implies an intense and almost painful longing for some crisis, a dulness of suspense lighted up with hope. The phrase is one of the many indications that the joyful and confident tone so often noticed in this Epistle came not from the absence of yearning for the freedom and activity of apostolic life, but from the victory over such longings through faith. Whatever the crisis might be, St. Paul looked eagerly for it.<p><span class= "bld">In nothing I shall be ashamed.</span>--The phrase is elsewhere used by St. Paul with especial reference to the shame which comes from hopes disappointed and professions unfulfilled. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-14.htm" title="For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.">2Corinthians 7:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-4.htm" title="Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, you) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.">2Corinthians 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-8.htm" title="For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord has given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:">2Corinthians 10:8</a>. Compare also the quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.">Isaiah 28:16</a> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm" title="As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumbling stone and rock of offense: and whoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.">Romans 9:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-6.htm" title="Why also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on him shall not be confounded.">1Peter 2:6</a>.) For (he says) "hope (fulfilled) maketh not ashamed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-5.htm" title="And hope makes not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us.">Romans 5:5</a>). So probably here; he trusts that in the hour of trial the confidence which he has felt and professed of being "able to do all things through Christ who strengthenth him" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-13.htm" title="I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.">Philippians 4:13</a>) may not come to shameful failure, but may "magnify Christ in all boldness of speech." There is a subtle touch of true Christian feeling in the fact that, when he speaks of the chance of failure, he uses the first person: "I shall be ashamed;" but when of triumph, it is "Christ shall be magnified" in me. If he fails, it must be through his own fault; if he triumphs, it will be through his Master's strength.<p><span class= "bld">In my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</span>--"In my body:" The phrase is, no doubt, suggested mainly by the idea of death--the death of a martyr in bodily torture or shame. There is the same connection of idea in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.">2Corinthians 4:10</a> : "always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, so that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our body." But while the word "flesh" is used in the New Testament in a bad sense, the "body" is always regarded as that in which we may "glorify God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm" title="For you are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.">1Corinthians 6:20</a>) by word and deed. It is not merely a vesture of the soul, but a part of the true man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm" title="And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.">1Thessalonians 5:23</a>), having membership of Christ, and being the temple of the Holy Ghost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/6-15.htm" title="Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.">1Corinthians 6:15-19</a>). In this passage the whole idea is of Christ in him; hence his body is spoken of as simply the tabernacle of the indwelling presence of Christ, and devoted only to "magnify" Him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed</span>. The Greek word for "earnest expectation," which occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19</a>, means literally, a watching with outstretched head, with the attention concentrated on one object, and turned away from all others. Neither his sufferings nor the opposition of the Judaizers will put him to shame. <span class="cmt_word">But that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</span> <span class="accented">After</span> " <span class="accented">boldness"</span> (<span class="accented">literally</span>, <span class="accented">boldness of speech</span>) we should expect the active form, "I shall magnify." St. Paul, in his humility, prefers the pasture, "Christ shall be magnified." Boldness of speech was to be his part, the glory should be Christ's. Whatever the issue might be, whether a life of Christian labor or a martyr's death, it would be well. The apostles were not omniscient, says Bengel, in relation to their own future lot; they lived in faith and hope. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-20 The apostle was a prisoner at Rome; and to take off the offence of the cross, he shows the wisdom and goodness of God in his sufferings. These things made him known, where he would never have otherwise been known; and led some to inquire after the gospel. He suffered from false friends, as well as from enemies. How wretched the temper of those who preached Christ out of envy and contention, and to add affliction to the bonds that oppressed this best of men! The apostle was easy in the midst of all. Since our troubles may tend to the good of many, we ought to rejoice. Whatever turns to our salvation, is by the Spirit of Christ; and prayer is the appointed means of seeking for it. Our earnest expectation and hope should not be to be honoured of men, or to escape the cross, but to be upheld amidst temptation, contempt, and affliction. Let us leave it to Christ, which way he will make us serviceable to his glory, whether by labour or suffering, by diligence or patience, by living to his honour in working for him, or dying to his honour in suffering for him.</body></html>
