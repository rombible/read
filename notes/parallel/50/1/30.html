How deeply this outrage impressed itself on the Apostle's own mind we see, both by his conduct to the magistrates at the moment, and also by the allusion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.">1Thessalonians 2:2</a>, to the time, when "we had suffered before and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi." Here he uses the remembrance to suggest to the Philippians that their struggle was only the same which he had borne, and borne successfully.

These words are best taken with Ver. 27, vers. 28 and 29 being parenthetical. The apostle returns to the military or gladiatorial metaphor of a contest, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>. He had himself been persecuted at Philippi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16.htm">Acts 16</a>:<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a>); now the Philippians heard of his Roman imprisonment, and were themselves suffering similar persecutions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:27-30 Those who profess the gospel of Christ, should live as becomes those who believe gospel truths, submit to gospel laws, and depend upon gospel promises. The original word conversation denotes the conduct of citizens who seek the credit, safety, peace, and prosperity of their city. There is that in the faith of the gospel, which is worth striving for; there is much opposition, and there is need of striving. A man may sleep and go to hell; but he who would go to heaven, must look about him and be diligent. There may be oneness of heart and affection among Christians, where there is diversity of judgment about many things. Faith is God's gift on the behalf of Christ; the ability and disposition to believe are from God. And if we suffer reproach and loss for Christ, we are to reckon them a gift, and prize them accordingly. Yet salvation must not be ascribed to bodily afflictions, as though afflictions and worldly persecutions deserved it; but from God only is salvation: faith and patience are his gifts.</body></html>
