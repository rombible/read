The word "sincere" (used only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-3.htm" title="According as his divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue:">2Peter 1:3</a>), and the corresponding substantive, "sincerity" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-8.htm" title="Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.">1Corinthians 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.">2Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm" title="For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.">2Corinthians 2:17</a>), although there is some uncertainty as to their derivation, undoubtedly signify purity tested and found clear of all base admixtures. The word "without offence" is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-16.htm" title="And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offense toward God, and toward men.">Acts 24:16</a> ("a conscience void of offence") for that which is free from the stumbling of error; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-32.htm" title="Give none offense, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:">1Corinthians 10:32</a> ("giving none offence") for that at which none will stumble. The latter sense (nearly equivalent to the "unreprovable" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a>) better suits this passage. For "sincere" describes the positive aspect of purity; "without offence" the more negative aspect, in which it is found to present no excuse for fault-finding or scandal. It is, therefore, the "sincerity," not of unconscious innocence, but of well-tried and thoughtful purity, proof even against suspicion, which St. Paul describes as the perfect fruit of love "overflowing in knowledge."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That ye may approve things that are excellent</span>. Love, issuing in spiritual discernment, would enable them to recognize, to test, to prove things that are excellent; so Bengel," Non modo prae malts bona, seal in bonds optima." This seems better than the alternative rendering, "<span class="accented">to</span> prove the things that differ" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-18.htm">Romans 2:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That ye may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ</span>. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> according to the common derivation (from <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f35;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>, sunlight, and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>), means "judged in the full light of the sun," that is, pure, true; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-21.htm">John 2:21</a>, "He that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God." According to another possible derivation, the word would mean "unmixed," that is, genuine, sincere. "Without offense" may be taken actively or passively; without giving offense (causing stumbling) to others, or without stumbling themselves. Perhaps the latter sense is more suitable here. He prays that the Philippians may be true and pure inwardly, and blameless in their outward lives. "Till," rather, "against the day of Christ." The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> does not denote time only, as <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in Ver. 6; it implies preparation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:8-11 Shall not we pity and love those souls whom Christ loves and pities? Those who abound in any grace, need to abound more. Try things which differ; that we may approve the things which are excellent. The truths and laws of Christ are excellent; and they recommend themselves as such to any attentive mind. Sincerity is that in which we should have our conversation in the world, and it is the glory of all our graces. Christians should not be apt to take offence, and should be very careful not to offend God or the brethren. The things which most honour God will most benefit us. Let us not leave it doubtful whether any good fruit is found in us or not. A small measure of Christian love, knowledge, and fruitfulness should not satisfy any.</body></html>
