There is a still fuller disclosure of a similar "spiritual experience" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-8.htm" title="We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;">2Corinthians 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-15.htm" title="And that he died for all, that they which live should not from now on live to themselves, but to him which died for them, and rose again.">2Corinthians 5:15</a>. It is rare in the apostolic writings. St. Paul seems, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="O you Corinthians, our mouth is open to you, our heart is enlarged.">2Corinthians 6:11</a>, almost to apologise for disclosing what is usually kept, in delicacy and reverence, for God alone.<p>(19) <span class= "bld">Shall turn to my salvation.</span>--Or, literally, <span class= "ital">shall issue in salvation to me.</span> The word "salvation" does not appear to be used here in its ordinary sense, that is, of primary or ultimate salvation from sin in Christ, but in the sense of "safety." The enemies of the Apostle thought to stir up fresh danger and difficulty for St. Paul; but the attempt (he says) will only turn out to his safety--a safety which he believes (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/1-25.htm" title="And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;">Philippians 1:25-26</a>) will be shown "in life," by his actual release and return to his beloved churches, but which, if God so wills it, will be at least equally manifested in the "death," which would bring him safe home to Christ. In either case he will be safe from all the enmity both of open sin and of malignant jealousy.<p><span class= "bld">Through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit.</span>--This overruling of all enmity to his safety he hopes for through the intercession of the Philippian Church (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-23.htm" title="There salute you Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;">Philemon 1:23</a>), and the fresh supply of grace which, through such intercession, may be given to him. For the word "supply" in this sense see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-15.htm" title="But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:">Ephesians 4:15</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-5.htm" title="He therefore that ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?">Galatians 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The Spirit of Jesus Christ.</span>--Of the application of this name to the Holy Ghost we have instances in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-9.htm" title="But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.">Romans 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-17.htm" title="Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.">2Corinthians 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm" title="And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.">Galatians 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-11.htm" title="Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.">1Peter 1:11</a>. Of these the first is the most notable, since in two clauses of the same sentence we have first "the Spirit of God," and then "the Spirit of Christ." He who is "sent by the Father in the name of the Son" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-26.htm" title="But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.">John 14:26</a>), and whose regeneration of the soul is the working out the image of Christ in it, may well be called "the Spirit of Christ." But the name has always some specialty of emphasis. Thus here, the whole conception of the passage is of Christ--"to me to live is Christ;" hence the use of this special and comparatively rare name of the Holy Ghost.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I know that this shall turn to my salvation</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, this, refers to the general preaching of Christ, rather than (as Calvin and others interpret) to the affliction raised up for St. Paul. The opposition of his enemies will stir him up to greater activity and earnestness, and so conduce to his spiritual well-being now and to his salvation hereafter. This he <span class="accented">knows</span>, for "all things work together for good to them that love God." Some, as Chrysostom, understand <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> here of present safety or deliverance from prison; but this seems improbable. The words are quoted from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-16.htm">Job 13:16</a>, Septuagint Version<span class="cmt_word">. Through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ</span>. He knows that they pray for him; he humbly believes that those prayers assist him in working out his own salvation. As the prayer ascends, says Bengel, the supply of the Spirit descends; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-5.htm">Galatians 2:5</a>, "He that ministereth ['supplieth,' R.V.] to you the Spirit." The Spirit is the supply; the Lord Jesus sends the quickening Spirit from the Father. Others, as Meyer, make the genitive subjective, and interpret "the aid which the Spirit supplies." The Spirit is here called "the Spirit of Jesus Christ" - "proceeding from the Father <span class="accented">and the Son."</span> So also <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-7.htm">Acts 16:7</a> (in the true reading), "the Spirit of Jesus." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-20 The apostle was a prisoner at Rome; and to take off the offence of the cross, he shows the wisdom and goodness of God in his sufferings. These things made him known, where he would never have otherwise been known; and led some to inquire after the gospel. He suffered from false friends, as well as from enemies. How wretched the temper of those who preached Christ out of envy and contention, and to add affliction to the bonds that oppressed this best of men! The apostle was easy in the midst of all. Since our troubles may tend to the good of many, we ought to rejoice. Whatever turns to our salvation, is by the Spirit of Christ; and prayer is the appointed means of seeking for it. Our earnest expectation and hope should not be to be honoured of men, or to escape the cross, but to be upheld amidst temptation, contempt, and affliction. Let us leave it to Christ, which way he will make us serviceable to his glory, whether by labour or suffering, by diligence or patience, by living to his honour in working for him, or dying to his honour in suffering for him.</body></html>
