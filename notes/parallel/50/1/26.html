It is used both of blessing beyond strict necessity, and of service beyond legal duty; in both of which there is ground for joy and thankfulness. This is, perhaps, best seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/9-15.htm" title="But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done to me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.">1Corinthians 9:15-18</a>, where he declares that the simple preaching of the gospel is "nothing to boast of," but that the preaching it without cost is "the boasting," of which he says that he would "rather die than that any man should make it void." (Comp. also the use of the same word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-16.htm" title="Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain.">Philippians 2:16</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-2.htm" title="For if Abraham were justified by works, he has whereof to glory; but not before God.">Romans 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-6.htm" title="Your glorying is not good. Know you not that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?">1Corinthians 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-14.htm" title="As also you have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as you also are our's in the day of the Lord Jesus.">2Corinthians 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-12.htm" title="For we commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that you may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.">2Corinthians 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-3.htm" title="Yet have I sent the brothers, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, you may be ready:">2Corinthians 9:3</a>.) Here, therefore, St. Paul speaks of them as having in him, and in their connection with him, a cause of boasting, or rejoicing, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-14.htm" title="As also you have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as you also are our's in the day of the Lord Jesus.">2Corinthians 1:14</a> ("We are your rejoicing, even as ye also are ours"), and declares that this will become "more abundant" by his coming to them again.<p><span class= "bld">In Jesus Christ for me.</span>--The original runs, "in Christ Jesus <span class= "ital">in</span> me." The parallelism is instructive: all Christian rejoicing, or confidence, is primarily "in Christ Jesus," even if it be secondarily "in" His servants. The suggestion of this idea here softens the apparent self-consciousness of the previous words. Comp., in 2 Corinthians 11, 12, his declaration of reluctance and distaste for the "boasting" of his apostolic authority and work, which was forced upon him.<p><span class= "bld">By my coming to you again.</span>--See in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm" title="As I sought you to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine,">1Timothy 1:3</a> the evidence of the fulfilment of this confident expectation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again</span>. Glorying or boasting (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), not rejoicing. Perhaps rather, as Meyer," That the matter in which you have to glory [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the bliss in which you rejoice as Christians] may increase abundantly in Christ Jesus [as the element or sphere of the glorying] in me [as the instrument or cause]." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:21-26 Death is a great loss to a carnal, worldly man, for he loses all his earthly comforts and all his hopes; but to a true believer it is gain, for it is the end of all his weakness and misery. It delivers him from all the evils of life, and brings him to possess the chief good. The apostle's difficulty was not between living in this world and living in heaven; between these two there is no comparison; but between serving Christ in this world and enjoying him in another. Not between two evil things, but between two good things; living to Christ and being with him. See the power of faith and of Divine grace; it can make us willing to die. In this world we are compassed with sin; but when with Christ, we shall escape sin and temptation, sorrow and death, for ever. But those who have most reason to desire to depart, should be willing to remain in the world as long as God has any work for them to do. And the more unexpected mercies are before they come, the more of God will be seen in them.</body></html>
