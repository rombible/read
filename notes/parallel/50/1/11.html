It may mean (as in these last two passages) "righteousness as a result," or (in the common sense of "fruit") the "result of righteousness." As the participle is properly "having been filled," thus referring, not to the future day of Christ, but to the whole time which that day shall complete, the former sense seems preferable. The righteousness which is "through Jesus Christ," "not" (as St. Paul says below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-9.htm" title="And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:">Philippians 3:9</a>) "our own righteousness, which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God," is clearly the likeness of Christ, and therefore in itself an all-sufficient fruit. Filled with it, we are (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-19.htm" title="And to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God.">Ephesians 3:19</a>) "filled with all the fulness of God."<p><span class= "bld">Unto the glory and praise of God.</span>--(Comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-6.htm" title="To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved.">Ephesians 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-12.htm" title="That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.">Ephesians 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-14.htm" title="Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.">Ephesians 1:14</a>.) In accordance with our Lord's own teaching: "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven." (See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-31.htm" title="Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.">1Corinthians 10:31</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Being filled with the fruits of righteousness</span>. The best manuscripts read "fruit." He prays that their love may abound, not only in knowledge and discernment, but also in the fruit of holy living. The fruit of righteousness is sanctification, which springs from justification, and manifests itself in holy living (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-12.htm">Amos 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which are by Jesus Christ</span>; rather, <span class="accented">through.</span> The righteousness of God's saints is not that" which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Christ" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4</a>). The branch lives by the life of the vine; the Christian lives by the life of Christ. It is his life, living in, assimilated by the Christian soul, which brings forth the fruit of righteousness. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the glory and praise of God.</span> The righteousness of God's saints, springing from the abiding presence of Christ, shows forth the glory of God. The glory of God is his majesty in itself; praise is the acknowledgment of this majesty by the voice and heart of man. The glory of God is the end of all Christian effort. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:8-11 Shall not we pity and love those souls whom Christ loves and pities? Those who abound in any grace, need to abound more. Try things which differ; that we may approve the things which are excellent. The truths and laws of Christ are excellent; and they recommend themselves as such to any attentive mind. Sincerity is that in which we should have our conversation in the world, and it is the glory of all our graces. Christians should not be apt to take offence, and should be very careful not to offend God or the brethren. The things which most honour God will most benefit us. Let us not leave it doubtful whether any good fruit is found in us or not. A small measure of Christian love, knowledge, and fruitfulness should not satisfy any.</body></html>
