The words "joy" and "rejoice" occur no less than thirteen times in this short Epistle; they express what his own feeling is, and what he desires that theirs should be.<p>(3, 4) <span class= "bld">I thank my God . . .</span>--These verses more accurately rendered will run thus: <span class= "ital">I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you at all times, in every prayer of mine for you all, uttering that prayer with</span> <span class= "ital">joy</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>with joyful confidence. The sense, however, is not materially altered. The emphatic earnestness of thanksgiving is seen in the reiteration which runs through the passage, and its absolute universality of scope is no less clearly marked. The closest parallel is again in the Epistles to the Thessalonians (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm" title="We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;">1Thessalonians 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;">2Thessalonians 2:3</a>), although in every Epistle, except the Epistle to the Galatians, there is an opening of thanksgiving.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I thank my God upon every remembrance of you</span>. All St. Paul's Epistles, except those to the Galatiaus, 1 Timothy, and Titus, begin with a thanksgiving. In this Epistle the thanksgiving is especially warm and earnest; no cloud of doubt darkened the apostle's confidence in the Philippians; he pours forth his gratitude to God for their spiritual gifts fervently and without reserve. <span class="accented">My God.</span> The pronoun expresses the inner consciousness of personal relations with God; it reminds us of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23</a>, "God, whose I am, and whom I serve." <span class="accented">Upon all my remembrance of you</span> (as R.V.) is the more exact rendering. The remembrance (not mention)was continuous; he "had them in his heart," and that unbroken remembrance resulted in unbroken thanksgiving. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 The highest honour of the most eminent ministers is, to be servants of Christ. And those who are not really saints on earth, never will be saints in heaven. Out of Christ, the best saints are sinners, and unable to stand before God. There is no peace without grace. Inward peace springs from a sense of Divine favour. And there is no grace and peace but from God our Father, the fountain and origin of all blessings. At Philippi the apostle was evil entreated, and saw little fruit of his labour; yet he remembers Philippi with joy. We must thank our God for the graces and comforts, gifts and usefulness of others, as we receive the benefit, and God receives the glory. The work of grace will never be perfected till the day of Jesus Christ, the day of his appearance. But we may always be confident God will perform his good work, in every soul wherein he has really begun it by regeneration; though we must not trust in outward appearances, nor in any thing but a new creation to holiness. People are dear to their ministers, when they receive benefit by their ministry. Fellow-sufferers in the cause of God should be dear one to another.</body></html>
