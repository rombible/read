It is itself used only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-36.htm" title="And you yourselves like to men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he comes and knocks, they may open to him immediately.">Luke 12:36</a>, "When he shall return (<span class= "ital">break up</span>) from the wedding." The metaphor is drawn either from "loosing" from the shore of life, or (perhaps better) from striking tents and breaking up a camp. The body (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.">2Corinthians 5:1</a>) is looked upon as a mere tabernacle. Each day is a march nearer home, and death is the last striking of the tent on arrival.<p><span class= "bld">To be with Christ.</span>--This is contemplated by St. Paul as the immediate consequence of death, even while still "out of the body," and before the great day. The state of the faithful departed is usually spoken of as one of "rest" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1Corinthians 15:51-52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm" title="For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.">1Thessalonians 4:14-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-13.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from now on: Yes, said the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.">Revelation 14:13</a>), although not without expectation and longing for the consummation of all things (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/6-10.htm" title="And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, do you not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?">Revelation 6:10-11</a>). Such a condition of rest, and suspension of conscious exercise of spiritual energy, is, indeed, that which human reason and analogy would suggest, so far as they can suggest anything on this mysterious subject. But such passages as this seem certainly to imply that this rest is emphatically a "rest in the Lord," having an inner consciousness of communion with Christ. His "descent unto Hades," not only brings out the reality of the unseen world of souls, but also claims it as His. As on earth and in heaven, so also in the intermediate state, we are "ever with the Lord;" and that state, though not yet made perfect, is spiritually far higher than this earthly life. The original here is an emphatic double comparative, "far, far better."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I am in a strait betwixt two</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but</span> (so the best manuscripts) <span class="accented">I am straitened</span>, <span class="accented">hemmed in</span> (Bishop Lightfoot) <span class="accented">betwixt the two</span> alternatives, life and death, pressing upon me, constraining me on either side. <span class="cmt_word">Having a desire to depart</span>; having my desire set towards departing <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). The word occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> It is used of a ship, to loose from its moorings; or a camp, to break up; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>, "If our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>)." Probably here the metaphor is taken from tent life; to loosen, to remove the tent, the temporary abode, in the journey to the heavenly city. <span class="cmt_word">And to be with Christ</span>. The holy dead are with Christ, they rest from their labors; they live unto God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-38.htm">Luke 20:38</a>); they do not sleep idly without consciousness, for they are described in Holy Scripture as witnesses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>) of the race set before living Christians (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-6.htm">2 Corinthians 5:6, 8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-59.htm">Acts 7:59</a>). Yet they are elsewhere described as sleeping (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51, 52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:14, 15</a>); for the rest of the spirits of just men in Paradise is as a sleep compared with the perfect consummation and bliss of God's elect, both in body and soul, in his everlasting glory. <span class="cmt_word">Which is far better</span>; read and translate, <span class="accented">for it is by much very far better.</span> He piles up comparatives, as if unable to find words capable of expressing the glory of his hope. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:21-26 Death is a great loss to a carnal, worldly man, for he loses all his earthly comforts and all his hopes; but to a true believer it is gain, for it is the end of all his weakness and misery. It delivers him from all the evils of life, and brings him to possess the chief good. The apostle's difficulty was not between living in this world and living in heaven; between these two there is no comparison; but between serving Christ in this world and enjoying him in another. Not between two evil things, but between two good things; living to Christ and being with him. See the power of faith and of Divine grace; it can make us willing to die. In this world we are compassed with sin; but when with Christ, we shall escape sin and temptation, sorrow and death, for ever. But those who have most reason to desire to depart, should be willing to remain in the world as long as God has any work for them to do. And the more unexpected mercies are before they come, the more of God will be seen in them.</body></html>
