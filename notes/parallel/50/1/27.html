Of the history of the Church at Philippi we have no historical record after the notice of St. Paul's first visit, and of the violence which he then had to endure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/16-12.htm" title="And from there to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.">Acts 16:12-40</a>). But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-5.htm" title="For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fights, within were fears.">2Corinthians 7:5</a>, written certainly from Macedonia, probably from Philippi, towards the close of the third missionary journey, we find St. Paul saying, "When we were come to Macedonia our flesh had no rest. Without were fightings, within were fears." (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-2.htm" title="How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.">2Corinthians 8:2</a> of the same Epistle.) It would seem, therefore, that the subsequent history of the Philippian Church corresponded only too well to the circumstances under which its Christianity first began.<p>(27) <span class= "bld">Let your conversation . . .</span>--The original is here (as in the famous passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Philippians 3:20</a>), <span class= "ital">Use your citizenship</span> (that is, of the kingdom of heaven) <span class= "ital">worthily of the gospel of Christ.</span> The same word is employed by St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-1.htm" title="And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.">Acts 23:1</a> ("I have walked in all good conscience before God"), with an obvious reference to his citizenship in the chosen nation of Israel. Its use in this Epistle is suggestive--both as natural to one contemplating the great imperial city, and writing to the people of a Roman colony proud of their full citizenship, and also as leading on to that great conception of the unity of the Church in earth and in heaven, which is the main subject of the Ephesian, and in some degree of the Colossian, Epistle.<p><span class= "bld">In one spirit, with one mind.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">in one spirit, one soul.</span> The phrase "in one spirit" may refer to the spirit of man, or to the Spirit of God. If it be intended to be strictly parallel to the "one soul" (which has no separate preposition in the Greek), the former sense is manifestly suggested. If, however, the words "with one soul" be connected, as is not unnatural, with "striving together," this suggestion falls to the ground; and the usage of this Epistle (see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-1.htm" title="If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,">Philippians 2:1-7</a>), and the other Epistles of the same period (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/2-18.htm" title="For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.">Ephesians 2:18-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-5.htm" title="Which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-18.htm" title="And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;">Ephesians 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-18.htm" title="Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;">Ephesians 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-8.htm" title=" Who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.">Colossians 1:8</a>), certainly favours the latter interpretation. In either case "the soul" (as in the famous three-fold division of men's nature in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm" title="And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.">1Thessalonians 5:23</a>) is that element of humanity which is the seat of emotion and passion. (Comp. the "one heart and one soul" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-32.htm" title="And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.">Acts 4:32</a>.) This element the Christianity of the New Testament, unlike Stoicism or asceticism, will not crush, but enlist, as it enlists the body also, in the free service of God.<p><span class= "bld">Striving together for the faith.</span>--Properly, <span class= "ital">with the faith.</span> The faith of the gospel--the power of Christianity--is personified. The Philippians are to be combatants on the same side against the same foes (compare the use of the same word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-3.htm" title="And I entreat you also, true yoke fellow, help those women which labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellow laborers, whose names are in the book of life.">Philippians 4:3</a>). The metaphor seems drawn from the games, as is seen by the use of the simple verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-8.htm" title="Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:">2Timothy 2:8</a>, "If a man strive . . . he is not crowned, except he strive lawfully." In the exhortation to stand fast (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/6-13.htm" title="Why take to you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.">Ephesians 6:13-14</a>) we have the element of passive endurance, here of active and aggressive energy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Only let your conversation be</span>. St. Paul exhorts the Philippians to steadfastness. Only, whatever happens, whether I come or no, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, behave as citizens (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f29;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>. The verb also occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-1.htm">Acts 23:1</a>, "I have lived (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) in all good conscience towards God." St. Paul was himself a Roman citizen; he was writing from Rome; his presence the re was caused by his having exercised the rights of citizenship in appealing to Caesar. He was writing to a place largely inhabited by Roman citizens (for Philippi was a Roman colony), a place in which he had declared himself to be a Roman (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-37.htm">Acts 16:37</a>). The metaphor was natural. Some of you are citizens of Rome, the imperial city; live, all of you, as citizens of the heavenly country, the city of the living God. <span class="cmt_word">As it becometh the gospel of Christ</span>; rather, as R.V. margin, <span class="accented">behave as citizens worthily of.</span> There is a striking parallel in Polycarp's letter to these same Philippians (sect. 5). <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> literally, "If we live as citizens worthily of him, we shall also reign with him." <span class="cmt_word">That whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit</span>. The metaphor is military, and follows naturally from the thought of citizenship. Philippi was a military colony, its chief magistrates were praetors, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-20.htm">Acts 16:20</a>), literally, "generals" (comp. Eph. 6:13 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>). Spirit is the highest part of our immaterial nature, which, when enlightened by the Holy Spirit of God, can rise into communion with God, and discern the truths of the world unseen. <span class="accented">In one spirit</span>; because the spirits of believers are knit together into one fellowship by the one Holy Spirit of God abiding in them all. This distinction between spirit and soul occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>. The soul is the lower part of our inner being, the seat of the appetites, passions, affections, connected above with the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, below with the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> <span class="cmt_word">With one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel</span>; with one soul (not mind); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with all the desires and emotions concentrated on one object, all acting together in the one great work; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32</a>, "Striving together with one another for the faith," rather than "striving together with the faith." The personification of faith, though approved by high authority, seems forced and improbable. Faith is here used objectively; the faith of the gospel is the doctrine of the gospel, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-23.htm">Galatians 1:23</a>, "The faith which once he destroyed." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:27-30 Those who profess the gospel of Christ, should live as becomes those who believe gospel truths, submit to gospel laws, and depend upon gospel promises. The original word conversation denotes the conduct of citizens who seek the credit, safety, peace, and prosperity of their city. There is that in the faith of the gospel, which is worth striving for; there is much opposition, and there is need of striving. A man may sleep and go to hell; but he who would go to heaven, must look about him and be diligent. There may be oneness of heart and affection among Christians, where there is diversity of judgment about many things. Faith is God's gift on the behalf of Christ; the ability and disposition to believe are from God. And if we suffer reproach and loss for Christ, we are to reckon them a gift, and prize them accordingly. Yet salvation must not be ascribed to bodily afflictions, as though afflictions and worldly persecutions deserved it; but from God only is salvation: faith and patience are his gifts.</body></html>
