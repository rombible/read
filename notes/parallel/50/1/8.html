These instances show in what sense St. Paul interpreted such commands as the "swear not at all" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-34.htm" title="But I say to you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:">Matthew 5:34</a>.<p><span class= "bld">In the bowels of Jesus Christ.</span>--The use of the word, which we translate (not very happily or correctly) by "bowels," is common with St. Paul. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-12.htm" title="You are not straitened in us, but you are straitened in your own bowels.">2Corinthians 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-15.htm" title="And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.">2Corinthians 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;">Colossians 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-7.htm" title="For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by you, brother.">Philemon 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-12.htm" title="Whom I have sent again: you therefore receive him, that is, my own bowels:">Philemon 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-20.htm" title="Yes, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.">Philemon 1:20</a>.) It corresponds to our use of "heart" as the seat of affection--the word "heart" itself in the New Testament being employed, in a wider sense, to signify the whole inner man. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-18.htm" title="The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,">Ephesians 1:18</a> : "the eyes of your heart being enlightened," and Note there.) But the phrase here is striking and even startling. "I long after you" (says St. Paul) "in the heart of Jesus Christ." He can say (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>), "I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me." Hence the deep yearning of love which he feels for them he knows to be an emanation, faint indeed, but true, from the "heart of Jesus Christ" dwelling in him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For God is my record</span> - rather, <span class="accented">witness</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, here rendered "bowels," means the heart, liver, etc.. he not the entrails. The expression is remarkable, and is well illustrated by Bengel's striking words, "Paulus non in Pauli, sed Jesu Christi movetur visceribus." "Not I, but Christ liveth in me." He is so united with Christ that he feels with the heart of Christ, he loves with the love of Christ. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:8-11 Shall not we pity and love those souls whom Christ loves and pities? Those who abound in any grace, need to abound more. Try things which differ; that we may approve the things which are excellent. The truths and laws of Christ are excellent; and they recommend themselves as such to any attentive mind. Sincerity is that in which we should have our conversation in the world, and it is the glory of all our graces. Christians should not be apt to take offence, and should be very careful not to offend God or the brethren. The things which most honour God will most benefit us. Let us not leave it doubtful whether any good fruit is found in us or not. A small measure of Christian love, knowledge, and fruitfulness should not satisfy any.</body></html>
