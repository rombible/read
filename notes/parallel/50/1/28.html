Aurelius, <span class= "ital">Med.</span> xi. 3.)<p><span class= "bld">And that of</span> <span class= "bld">God.</span>--These words apply to the word "token," and so derivatively both to "perdition" and "salvation." The sign is of God, because the gift of spiritual strength is of God, but it may be read by both sides. Like the pillar of God's presence, it is "a cloud and darkness" to the one, but "light by night" to the other.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in nothing terrified by your adversaries</span>; literally, snared, as a frightened horse. <span class="cmt_word">Which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation</span>; translate, <span class="accented">seeing that it</span> (<span class="accented">your courage</span>) <span class="accented">is to them an evident token of perdition</span>, <span class="accented">but</span> (with the best manuscripts) <span class="accented">of your salvation.</span> And that of God. These words are to be taken with "an evident token." The courage of God's saints in the midst of dangers is a proof of his presence and favor, a token of final victory (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-5.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:27-30 Those who profess the gospel of Christ, should live as becomes those who believe gospel truths, submit to gospel laws, and depend upon gospel promises. The original word conversation denotes the conduct of citizens who seek the credit, safety, peace, and prosperity of their city. There is that in the faith of the gospel, which is worth striving for; there is much opposition, and there is need of striving. A man may sleep and go to hell; but he who would go to heaven, must look about him and be diligent. There may be oneness of heart and affection among Christians, where there is diversity of judgment about many things. Faith is God's gift on the behalf of Christ; the ability and disposition to believe are from God. And if we suffer reproach and loss for Christ, we are to reckon them a gift, and prize them accordingly. Yet salvation must not be ascribed to bodily afflictions, as though afflictions and worldly persecutions deserved it; but from God only is salvation: faith and patience are his gifts.</body></html>
