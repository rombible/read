The exact translation is, <span class= "ital">But if to live in the flesh this is to me a fruit of work, and what</span> (or, <span class= "ital">what also</span>)<span class= "ital"> I shall choose I know not.</span> The construction is clearly broken by emotion or absorption in thought; it can only be supplied by conjecture. If (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-2.htm" title="For if I make you sorry, who is he then that makes me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?">2Corinthians 2:2</a>) the word "and," or "also," can be used to introduce the principal clause ("what then I shall choose," &c.), the construction will be correct, though harsh. If otherwise, we must suppose either that the sentence is broken at the word "work," or that the whole should run, <span class= "ital">But what if to live in the flesh is a part of work? And what I shall choose, I know not, </span>&c. But though the construction is obscure, the sense is plain. St. Paul had said, "to die is gain." But the thought crosses him that to live still in the flesh, this and this only is (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>carries with it) a fruit of apostolical labour, in souls brought to Christ or built up in Him. Accordingly what to choose he knows not. For in such a harvest there is a gain, which outweighs his own personal gain on the other side.<p><span class= "bld">I am in a strait betwixt</span> (<span class= "ital">the</span>)<span class= "bld"> two.</span>--The word here used signifies "to be hemmed in," or "confined," and is generally associated with some idea of distress (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-45.htm" title="And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng you and press you, and say you, Who touched me?">Luke 8:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-43.htm" title="For the days shall come on you, that your enemies shall cast a trench about you, and compass you round, and keep you in on every side,">Luke 19:43</a>), not unfrequently with the pressure of disease (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-24.htm" title="And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought to him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.">Matthew 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-38.htm" title="And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they sought him for her.">Luke 4:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-8.htm" title="And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.">Acts 28:8</a>). Our Lord uses it of mental distress in Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-50.htm" title="But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!">Luke 12:50</a>): "How am I straitened till it be accomplished!" Here the sense is clear. St. Paul's mind is "hemmed in" between two opposing considerations, till it knows not which way to move, even in desire.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor: yet what I shall choose I wot not</span>; or perhaps, as Meyer, "I make not known." St. Paul wavers between his own personal longing for rest in Paradise with Christ, and the thought that the continuance of his life on earth might conduce to the spreading of the gospel. The grammar of the Greek sentence aptly represents the apostle's hesitation. The construction is almost hopelessly confused. Perhaps the interpretation of the R.V. is the simplest: "But if to live in the flesh, - if this is the fruit of my work, then what shall choose I wot not." Thus <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is parallel with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (Ver. 21); <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;</span> is also a gain, a fruit; the genitive is one of apposition; the work itself is the fruit. St. Paul, says Bengel, regards his work as fruit, others seek fruit from their work. Bishop Lightfoot proposes another rendering, "But what if my living in the flesh will bear fruit, etc.? In fact what to choose I know not." Surely, says Bengel, the Christian's lot is excellent; he can hesitate only in the choice of blessings; disappointed he cannot be. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:21-26 Death is a great loss to a carnal, worldly man, for he loses all his earthly comforts and all his hopes; but to a true believer it is gain, for it is the end of all his weakness and misery. It delivers him from all the evils of life, and brings him to possess the chief good. The apostle's difficulty was not between living in this world and living in heaven; between these two there is no comparison; but between serving Christ in this world and enjoying him in another. Not between two evil things, but between two good things; living to Christ and being with him. See the power of faith and of Divine grace; it can make us willing to die. In this world we are compassed with sin; but when with Christ, we shall escape sin and temptation, sorrow and death, for ever. But those who have most reason to desire to depart, should be willing to remain in the world as long as God has any work for them to do. And the more unexpected mercies are before they come, the more of God will be seen in them.</body></html>
