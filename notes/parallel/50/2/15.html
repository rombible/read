The whole passage seems certainly a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-5.htm" title="They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.">Deuteronomy 32:5</a>, as it runs in the Greek version, speaking of the Israelites as "no children of God, full of blemish, a crooked and perverse generation." The word "crooked" is similarly applied to the unbelieving Jews by St. Peter in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-40.htm" title="And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.">Acts 2:40</a>, and the epithet "faithless and perverse generation" used by our Lord in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-17.htm" title="Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him here to me.">Matthew 17:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-41.htm" title="And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you?

Christians are as the lesser lights of heaven, dim in comparison with the Sun of Righteousness, perhaps shining by His reflected light, and seen only in the night of this life, till He shall rise on us again in the "day of Christ" spoken of in the next verse. The word, therefore, stands half-way between "light" itself, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-14.htm" title="You are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.">Matthew 5:14</a>, and the merely artificial "light" (or, <span class= "ital">candle</span>) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-35.htm" title="He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.">John 5:35</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That ye may be blameless and harmless</span>; read, with the best manuscripts, <span class="accented">that ye may become</span>; an exhortation to continued progress.

"The slave may murmur," says Chrysostom, "but what <span class="accented">son</span> will murmur, who, while working for his father, works also for himself?" Substitute "blameless" for "without rebuke," and "generation" for "nation." There is a close resemblance bore, especially in the Greek, and an evident reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-5.htm">Deuteronomy 32:5</a>.

With great care, lest, with all our advantages, we should come short. Work out your salvation, for it is God who worketh in you. This encourages us to do our utmost, because our labour shall not be in vain: we must still depend on the grace of God. The working of God's grace in us, is to quicken and engage our endeavours. God's good-will to us, is the cause of his good work in us. Do your duty without murmurings. Do it, and do not find fault with it. Mind your work, and do not quarrel with it. By peaceableness; give no just occasion of offence. The children of God should differ from the sons of men. The more perverse others are, the more careful we should be to keep ourselves blameless and harmless. The doctrine and example of consistent believers will enlighten others, and direct their way to Christ and holiness, even as the light-house warns mariners to avoid rocks, and directs their course into the harbour. Let us try thus to shine. The gospel is the word of life, it makes known to us eternal life through Jesus Christ. Running, denotes earnestness and vigour, continual pressing forward; labouring, denotes constancy, and close application. It is the will of God that believers should be much in rejoicing; and those who are so happy as to have good ministers, have great reason to rejoice with them.</body></html>
