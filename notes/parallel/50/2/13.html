The origination of all in God, and the free action (which is in some sense origination) of man, are both truths recognised by our deepest consciousness, but to our logic irreconcilable. In one passage only (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/9-14.htm" title="What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.">Romans 9:14-24</a>) does St. Paul touch, and that slightly and suggestively, on their reconcilement: generally Holy Scripture--in this confirming human reason--brings out each vividly and profoundly in turn, and leaves the problem of their reconcilement untouched. Here the paradoxical form of the sentence forces on the mind the recognition of the co-existence of both. If that recognition be accepted, the force of the reasoning is clear. The only encouragement to work, in a being weak and finite like man, is the conviction that the Almighty power is working in him, both as to will and deed.<p>The word "worketh in you" is constantly applied to the divine operation in the soul (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-6.htm" title="And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which works all in all.">1Corinthians 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-11.htm" title="But all these works that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.">1Corinthians 12:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-8.htm" title="(For he that worked effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)">Galatians 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-11.htm" title="In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will:">Ephesians 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm" title="Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,">Ephesians 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a>); rarely, as here (in the word rendered "to do") to the action of men. It must necessarily extend to the will as well as the action; otherwise God would not be sovereign in the inner realm of mind (as, indeed, Stoic philosophy denied that He was). We are familiar with the influence of one created will over another--an influence real, though limited, yet in no sense compulsive. From this experience we may catch a faint glimpse of the inner working of the Spirit of God on the spirit of man. Hence, while we cannot even conceive the existence of freedom under an unbending impersonal law or force, the harmony of our will with a Supreme Personal Will is mysterious, indeed, but not inconceivable.<p><span class= "bld">Of his good pleasure.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">on behalf of His good pleasure;</span> that is, in harmony with it. On the double sense of "good pleasure" see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-5.htm" title="Having predestinated us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,">Ephesians 1:5</a>. Here, probably, the meaning is His "gracious will" for our salvation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For it is God which worketh in you</span>.

The grace of God is alleged as a motive for earnest Christian work. The doctrines of grace and free-will are not contradictory: they may seem so to our limited understanding; but in truth they complete and snpplement one another. St. Paul does not attempt to solve the problem in theory; he bids us solve it in the life of faith (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>. he "So run that ye may obtain;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-16.htm">Romans 9:16</a>, "It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy"). <span class="cmt_word">Of his good pleasure</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). As the glory of God is the ultimate end (Ver. 11), so the good will of God is the first cause of our salwttiou: "God will have all men to be saved" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:12-18 We must be diligent in the use of all the means which lead to our salvation, persevering therein to the end. With great care, lest, with all our advantages, we should come short. Work out your salvation, for it is God who worketh in you. This encourages us to do our utmost, because our labour shall not be in vain: we must still depend on the grace of God. The working of God's grace in us, is to quicken and engage our endeavours. God's good-will to us, is the cause of his good work in us. Do your duty without murmurings. Do it, and do not find fault with it. Mind your work, and do not quarrel with it. By peaceableness; give no just occasion of offence. The children of God should differ from the sons of men. The more perverse others are, the more careful we should be to keep ourselves blameless and harmless. The doctrine and example of consistent believers will enlighten others, and direct their way to Christ and holiness, even as the light-house warns mariners to avoid rocks, and directs their course into the harbour. Let us try thus to shine. The gospel is the word of life, it makes known to us eternal life through Jesus Christ. Running, denotes earnestness and vigour, continual pressing forward; labouring, denotes constancy, and close application. It is the will of God that believers should be much in rejoicing; and those who are so happy as to have good ministers, have great reason to rejoice with them.</body></html>
