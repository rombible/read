From this St. Paul proceeds to the last act of His self-humiliation in death: "He became obedient," that is, to God's will, "even up to death." His death is not here regarded as an atonement, for in that light it could be no pattern to us; but as the completion of the obedience of His life. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-19.htm" title="For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.">Romans 5:19</a>.) Of that life as a whole He said, "I came down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him that sent Me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-38.htm" title="For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.">John 6:38</a>); and the doing that will (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/10-9.htm" title="Then said he, See, I come to do your will, O God. He takes away the first, that he may establish the second.">Hebrews 10:9-10</a>) ended in "the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all." In this light His death is the perfection of the suffering which, in consequence of the power of sin in the world, must be faced in doing the will of God (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-12.htm" title="Yes, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.">2Timothy 3:12</a>); in this light we can follow it, and even "fill up what is lacking of the sufferings of Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Even the death of the cross.</span>--Properly, <span class= "ital">and that too, the death of the cross; </span>emphasising its peculiar shame and humiliation as an "accursed" death. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And being found in fashion as a man</span>. He humbled himself in the Incarnation; but this was not all. The apostle has hitherto spoken of our Lord's Godhead which he had from the beginning, and of his assumption of our human nature. He now speaks of him as he appeared in the sight of men. The aorist participle, "being found (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>)," refers to the time of his earthly life when he appeared as a man among men. Fashion (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), as opposed to form (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>), implies the outward and transitory. In outward appearance he was as a man; he was more, for he was God. He humbled himself, and became obedient unto death; translate, as R.V., <span class="accented">obedient.</span> The participle implies that the supreme act of self-humiliation consisted in the Lord's voluntary submission to death. the obedience of his perfect life extended even unto death. "He taketh away [literally, 'beareth,' <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>] the sin of the world;" "The wages of sin is death;" therefore he suffered death for the sin which, himself sinless, he vouchsafed to bear. Here we may remark in passing that this connection of death with sin must have made death all the more awful to our sinless Lord. Even the death of the cross. No ordinary death, but of all forms of death the most torturing, the most full of shame - a death reserved by the Romans for slaves, a death accursed in the eyes of the Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-11 The example of our Lord Jesus Christ is set before us. We must resemble him in his life, if we would have the benefit of his death. Notice the two natures of Christ; his Divine nature, and human nature. Who being in the form of God, partaking the Divine nature, as the eternal and only-begotten Son of God, Joh 1:1, had not thought it a robbery to be equal with God, and to receive Divine worship from men. His human nature; herein he became like us in all things except sin. Thus low, of his own will, he stooped from the glory he had with the Father before the world was. Christ's two states, of humiliation and exaltation, are noticed. Christ not only took upon him the likeness and fashion, or form of a man, but of one in a low state; not appearing in splendour. His whole life was a life of poverty and suffering. But the lowest step was his dying the death of the cross, the death of a malefactor and a slave; exposed to public hatred and scorn. The exaltation was of Christ's human nature, in union with the Divine. At the name of Jesus, not the mere sound of the word, but the authority of Jesus, all should pay solemn homage. It is to the glory of God the Father, to confess that Jesus Christ is Lord; for it is his will, that all men should honour the Son as they honour the Father, Joh 5:23. Here we see such motives to self-denying love as nothing else can supply. Do we thus love and obey the Son of God?</body></html>
