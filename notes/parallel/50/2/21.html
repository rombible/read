St. Paul's declaration is startling; for he had certainly some "brethren with him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-21.htm" title="Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers which are with me greet you.">Philippians 4:21</a>). But the scanty notice of them in the close of this Epistle contrasts strongly with the detailed and affectionate mention of his companions by name in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/4-7.htm" title=" All my state shall Tychicus declare to you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord:">Colossians 4:7-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philemon/1-23.htm" title="There salute you Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;">Philemon 1:23-24</a>. It would seem as if at this time he was either separated accidentally from his most trusty disciples, or that there had been a temporary falling away from him, in some degree like that which he describes with so much sadness in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/4-9.htm" title="Do your diligence to come shortly to me:">2Timothy 4:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-16.htm" title="At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.">2Timothy 4:16</a>. His words need not be taken as accusing all of absolute selfishness and unfaithfulness, but they are nevertheless startling enough.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's</span>. <span class="accented">All of them</span>, he says (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); Timothy is the one exception. He calls those about him brethren in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-21.htm">Philippians 4:21</a>; but, it seems, they were like St. Paul, not willing to spend and to be spent for the salvation of souls. It was a great sacrifice in one who so yearned for Christian sympathy to submit to the absence of the one true loving friend. St. Paul's spiritual isolation increases our wonder and admiration for the strain of holy joy which runs through this Epistle. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:19-30 It is best with us, when our duty becomes natural to us. Naturally, that is, sincerely, and not in pretence only; with a willing heart and upright views. We are apt to prefer our own credit, ease, and safety, before truth, holiness, and duty; but Timothy did not so. Paul desired liberty, not that he might take pleasure, but that he might do good. Epaphroditus was willing to go to the Philippians, that he might be comforted with those who had sorrowed for him when he was sick. It seems, his illness was caused by the work of God. The apostle urges them to love him the more on that account. It is doubly pleasant to have our mercies restored by God, after great danger of their removal; and this should make them more valued. What is given in answer to prayer, should be received with great thankfulness and joy.</body></html>
