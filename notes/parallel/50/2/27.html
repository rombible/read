Apparently a primary word; sadness.</span><br /><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/philippians/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">God had mercy on him . . . and on me also.</span>--The passage, over and above its interest as an example of the strong personal affection which belonged to St. Paul's nature, and harmonised with his wide scope of Christian love, is notable as showing clearly that the Apostle's power of miracle, great as it was, was not his own, to use at his own will. When it was needed to be "the sign of an Apostle" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="Greet one another with an holy kiss.">2Corinthians 13:12</a>) it was given; and at special times, as at Ephesus, it was given in "special" fulness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-11.htm" title="And God worked special miracles by the hands of Paul:">Acts 19:11</a>). As we note, both in the Old Testament and in the New, special epochs of miracles in the history of the Church; so it would seem there were special occasions on which miracle came out prominently in the Apostle's preaching. We may, perhaps, infer from certain points in the descriptions of the healing of the cripple at the Beautiful Gate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-4.htm" title="And Peter, fastening his eyes on him with John, said, Look on us.">Acts 3:4</a>), and at Lystra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-8.htm" title="And there sat a certain man at Lystra, weak in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:">Acts 14:8</a>) that some spiritual intimation warned them when the hour of miracle was come. But an Apostle could not, as our Lord would not, work miracles for his own needs. Thus in this case, deeply as he sorrowed for Epaphroditus, there is no hint of his exercising that power on his behalf. He could only pray that God would have mercy on him, and thank God when that prayer was heard.<p><span class= "bld">Sorrow upon sorrow.</span>--That is, probably, upon the sorrow of captivity the sorrow of losing one who had (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-30.htm" title="Because for the work of Christ he was near to death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.">Philippians 2:30</a>) risked his life in the ardour of service to the captive.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow</span>. St. Paul recognizes the thankfulness of Epaphroditus for the recovery of his health: he shares that thankfulness himself. Mark his human sympathies; he had a "desire to depart," but he rejoices in the recovery of his friend. St. Paul does not seem to have healed Epaphroditus. The power of working miracles, like that of foreseeing the future (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-25.htm">Philippians 1:25</a>, and note), was not, it seems, continuous; both were exercised only in accordance with the revealed will of God and on occasions of especial moment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:19-30 It is best with us, when our duty becomes natural to us. Naturally, that is, sincerely, and not in pretence only; with a willing heart and upright views. We are apt to prefer our own credit, ease, and safety, before truth, holiness, and duty; but Timothy did not so. Paul desired liberty, not that he might take pleasure, but that he might do good. Epaphroditus was willing to go to the Philippians, that he might be comforted with those who had sorrowed for him when he was sick. It seems, his illness was caused by the work of God. The apostle urges them to love him the more on that account. It is doubly pleasant to have our mercies restored by God, after great danger of their removal; and this should make them more valued. What is given in answer to prayer, should be received with great thankfulness and joy.</body></html>
