We observe, however, that the word "disputings" is mostly used of objections and cavils in word (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-19.htm" title="For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:">Matthew 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-22.htm" title="But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said to them, What reason you in your hearts?">Luke 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-8.htm" title="But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the middle. And he arose and stood forth.">Luke 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-21.htm" title="Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.">Romans 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-1.htm" title="Him that is weak in the faith receive you, but not to doubtful disputations.">Romans 14:1</a>); although in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-47.htm" title="And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,">Luke 9:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-38.htm" title="And he said to them, Why are you troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?">Luke 24:38</a>, and perhaps <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-8.htm" title="I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.">1Timothy 2:8</a>, it is applied to the inner strife of the heart. In either case it seems mainly to indicate intellectual questionings. Similarly, the word "murmuring" is used of outward wranglings of discontent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-11.htm" title="And when they had received it, they murmured against the manager of the house,">Matthew 20:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-30.htm" title="But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners?">Luke 5:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-41.htm" title="The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.">John 6:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-43.htm" title="Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Murmur not among yourselves.">John 6:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-61.htm" title="When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said to them, Does this offend you?">John 6:61</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-12.htm" title="And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, No; but he deceives the people.">John 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.">Acts 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-10.htm" title="Neither murmur you, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.">1Corinthians 10:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-9.htm" title="Use hospitality one to another without grudging.">1Peter 4:9</a>), proceeding not so much from the mind, as from the heart. The object, moreover, contemplated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-15.htm" title="That you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the middle of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom you shine as lights in the world;">Philippians 2:15</a> is chiefly good example before men. Hence the primary reference would seem to be to their relation towards men, in spite of the close connection with the preceding verse. Nor can we forget that it is on unity among themselves that the main stress of the exhortation of this chapter turns. Of course it is obvious that the disposition rebuked is sure to show itself in both relations; and that, if checked in one, the check will react on the other.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Do all things without murmurings and disputings</span>. Obedience must be willing and cheerful. The word rendered "murmurings" (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">is that constantly</span> used in the Septuagint of the murmurings of the Israelites during their wanderings. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> may mean, as here rendered, "dis-putings," or more probably, in accordance with the New Testament use of the word, questionings, doubtings. Submission to God's will must be inward as well as outward. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:12-18 We must be diligent in the use of all the means which lead to our salvation, persevering therein to the end. With great care, lest, with all our advantages, we should come short. Work out your salvation, for it is God who worketh in you. This encourages us to do our utmost, because our labour shall not be in vain: we must still depend on the grace of God. The working of God's grace in us, is to quicken and engage our endeavours. God's good-will to us, is the cause of his good work in us. Do your duty without murmurings. Do it, and do not find fault with it. Mind your work, and do not quarrel with it. By peaceableness; give no just occasion of offence. The children of God should differ from the sons of men. The more perverse others are, the more careful we should be to keep ourselves blameless and harmless. The doctrine and example of consistent believers will enlighten others, and direct their way to Christ and holiness, even as the light-house warns mariners to avoid rocks, and directs their course into the harbour. Let us try thus to shine. The gospel is the word of life, it makes known to us eternal life through Jesus Christ. Running, denotes earnestness and vigour, continual pressing forward; labouring, denotes constancy, and close application. It is the will of God that believers should be much in rejoicing; and those who are so happy as to have good ministers, have great reason to rejoice with them.</body></html>
