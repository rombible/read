St. Paul's first reason for sending Epaphroditus was in itself a sufficient one, that in his convalescence he yearned for home, and needed a change thither. The original is strong, <span class= "ital">because he was continually longing</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-8.htm" title="For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.">Philippians 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-1.htm" title="Therefore, my brothers dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.">Philippians 4:1</a>) <span class= "ital">for you all.</span> But besides this he was "full of heaviness," or more properly, <span class= "ital">distressed and uneasy, </span>because of the effect which the news of his apparently fatal illness might cause at home.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he longed after you all</span>. The verb is strengthened by the preposition: "was eagerly longing." Perhaps it should be rendered. he "is longing;" like "I count it necessary," in Ver. 25. <span class="cmt_word">And was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.</span> "Full of heaviness" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) is the word used of our blessed Lord in his agony (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-37.htm">Matthew 26:37</a>). Some derive it from <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, he away from home; others, more probably, from <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, in the sense of loathing, weariness, satiety. The word implies heart-sickness, restless; unsatisfied weariness, produced by some overwhelming distress. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:19-30 It is best with us, when our duty becomes natural to us. Naturally, that is, sincerely, and not in pretence only; with a willing heart and upright views. We are apt to prefer our own credit, ease, and safety, before truth, holiness, and duty; but Timothy did not so. Paul desired liberty, not that he might take pleasure, but that he might do good. Epaphroditus was willing to go to the Philippians, that he might be comforted with those who had sorrowed for him when he was sick. It seems, his illness was caused by the work of God. The apostle urges them to love him the more on that account. It is doubly pleasant to have our mercies restored by God, after great danger of their removal; and this should make them more valued. What is given in answer to prayer, should be received with great thankfulness and joy.</body></html>
