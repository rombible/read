PAUL'S INTENTION TO SEND TIMOTHY, AND HOPE TO COME HIMSELF SHORTLY (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-19.htm" title="But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly to you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.">Philippians 2:19-24</a>).<p>(3) PRESENT MISSION OF EPAPHRODITUS, now recovered from his late sickness, and strong commendation of his zeal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-25.htm" title="Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.">Philippians 2:25-30</a>).]<p>(12-18) By the word "wherefore" St. Paul connects this exhortation with the great passage above. For the main idea is here of the presence of God in them, working out glory through a condition of humiliation, on condition of their fellow-working with Him; so that they shall appear as the "sons of God" and as "lights in the world." In all this there is clearly the imperfect but true likeness of the indwelling of Godhead in our Lord's humanity, exalting it through the two-fold humiliation to the unspeakable glory.<p>(12) <span class= "bld">As ye have always obeyed.</span>--It is notable that this Epistle is the only one which contains no direct rebuke. The Philippian Church has the glory of having "always obeyed," not (like the Galatian Church) "as in his presence only, but now much more in his absence." This "obedience" was to the will of God as set forth by him. In referring to it, there is an allusion to the "obedience" of Christ (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-8.htm" title="And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross.">Philippians 2:8</a>); hence their obedience includes also that willingness to suffer which He Himself has shown. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/1-29.htm" title="For to you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;">Philippians 1:29-30</a>.) To this, perhaps, there is a further allusion in the "fear and trembling" spoken of below. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-15.htm" title="And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.">2Corinthians 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-5.htm" title="Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ;">Ephesians 6:5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Work out your own salvation.</span>--To "work out" is (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-13.htm" title="Why take to you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.">Ephesians 6:13</a>) to carry out to completion what is begun. This is the function of man, as fellow-worker with God, first in his own soul, and then among his brethren. God is the "beginner and perfecter" of every "good work" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-6.htm" title="Being confident of this very thing, that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:">Philippians 1:6</a>); man's co-operation is secondary and intermediate.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence</span>. St. Paul passes to exhortation grounded on the Lord's perfect example. "Ye obeyed" (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) answers to the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of Ver. 8, and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> corresponds with the Savior's exaltation described in vers. 9-11. He encourages them by acknowledging their past obedience; he urges them to work, not for the sake of approving themselves to their earthly teacher, but to think of their unseen Lord, and to realize his presence all the more in St. Paul's absence. <span class="cmt_word">Work out your own salvation</span>. Complete it; God has begun the work; carry it out unto the end. Comp. the same word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a>, "having done all." Christ's work of atonement is finished: work <span class="accented">from</span> the cross: carry out the great work of sanctification by the help of the Holy Spirit. <span class="accented">Your</span> own: it is each man's own work; no human friend, no pastor, not even an apostle, can work it for him. <span class="cmt_word">With fear and trembling</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-15.htm">2 Corinthians 7:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5</a>). "Servi esse debetis exemplo Christi" (Bengel). Have an eager, trembling anxiety to obey God in all things, considering the tremendous sacrifice of Christ, the unspeakable depth and tenderness of his love, the immense importance of a present salvation from sin, the momentous preciousness of a future salvation from death. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:12-18 We must be diligent in the use of all the means which lead to our salvation, persevering therein to the end. With great care, lest, with all our advantages, we should come short. Work out your salvation, for it is God who worketh in you. This encourages us to do our utmost, because our labour shall not be in vain: we must still depend on the grace of God. The working of God's grace in us, is to quicken and engage our endeavours. God's good-will to us, is the cause of his good work in us. Do your duty without murmurings. Do it, and do not find fault with it. Mind your work, and do not quarrel with it. By peaceableness; give no just occasion of offence. The children of God should differ from the sons of men. The more perverse others are, the more careful we should be to keep ourselves blameless and harmless. The doctrine and example of consistent believers will enlighten others, and direct their way to Christ and holiness, even as the light-house warns mariners to avoid rocks, and directs their course into the harbour. Let us try thus to shine. The gospel is the word of life, it makes known to us eternal life through Jesus Christ. Running, denotes earnestness and vigour, continual pressing forward; labouring, denotes constancy, and close application. It is the will of God that believers should be much in rejoicing; and those who are so happy as to have good ministers, have great reason to rejoice with them.</body></html>
