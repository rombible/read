For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in carnal things.">Romans 15:27</a>; and see below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-25.htm" title="Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.">Philippians 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-30.htm" title="Because for the work of Christ he was near to death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.">Philippians 2:30</a>), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-6.htm" title="For for this cause pay you tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually on this very thing.">Romans 13:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-7.htm" title="And of the angels he said, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.">Hebrews 1:7</a>, where "the powers that be" and the angels are respectively called "ministers of God." But the great preponderance of New Testament usage appropriates it to priestly service (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-23.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.">Luke 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm" title="That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.">Romans 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-2.htm" title="A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.">Hebrews 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.">Hebrews 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-21.htm" title="Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.">Hebrews 9:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-11.htm" title="And every priest stands daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:">Hebrews 10:11</a>), which is obviously its sense here. The simplest interpretation of the whole passage would be to consider the Philippians merely as priests, and to suppose "sacrifice" to describe the chief function, and "ministration" the general function, of their priesthood. But the word "sacrifice," though it might etymologically mean the act of sacrifice, has universally in the New Testament the sense, not of the act, but of the thing sacrificed. Accordingly, here it would seem that, following afar off the example of the great high priest, the Christian is described as at once sacrifice and priest, "offering" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a>) "his own body as a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God," and with it the "sacrifice of praise" and the "sacrifice of doing good and communicating" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/13-15.htm" title="By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.">Hebrews 13:15-16</a>, and below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-18.htm" title="But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.">Philippians 4:18</a>). This union of sacrifice and ministration, being the work "of faith," is in St. Paul's view the thing really precious; his own death the mere preparation for it, in which he rejoices "to spend and be spent" for them.<p><span class= "bld">I joy, and rejoice with you all.</span>--That is, <span class= "ital">I joy, and that in sympathy with you.</span> First, "I joy" absolutely, in the feeling that "to depart and be with Christ," following Him in His own way of suffering, is far better. Next, "I joy in sympathy with you," in the sense of community of sacrifice, and brotherhood in suffering, for the sake of the one Lord. The emphasis laid on the latter clause harmonises with the old proverb, that sorrow is halved, and joy doubled, when it is shared with others.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith</span>. He again compares the advantages of life and death, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-20.htm">Philippians 1:20-25</a>. In the last verse he was speaking of the possibility of looking back from the day of Christ upon a life of prolonged labor. Here he supposes the other alternative. The form of the sentence, the particles used (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), and the indicative verb, all imply that the apostle looked forward to a martyr's death as the probable end of his life of warfare: Yea. he if I am even offered, as seems likely, and as I expect. <span class="accented">Offered</span>; the word means "poured out" as a libation or drink offering. St. Paul regards his blood shed in martyrdom as a libation poured forth in willing sacrifice. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "I am already being poured forth: the libation is commencing, the time of my departure is at hand." Compare also the similar words of Ignatius, 'Rom.' 2, and the words of the dying Seneca (Tacitus, 'Annals,' 15:64). Some think that the apostle, writing, as he does, to converted heathen, draws his metaphor from heathen sacrifices: in those sacrifices the libation was a much more important element than the drink offering in the Mosaic rites; and it was poured <span class="accented">upon</span> the sacrifice, whereas the drink offering seems to have been poured around the altar, not upon it. On the other hand, the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> is constantly used of the Jewish drink offering, and does not necessarily mean upon, but only "in addition to," or "at;" the drink offering being an accompaniment to the sacrifice. <span class="accented">Service</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>). This important word denotes in classical Greek <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> certain costly public offices at Athens, discharged by the richer citizens in rotation; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> any service or function In the Greek Scriptures it is used of priestly ministrations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-21.htm">Hebrews 9:21</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16</a>). In ecclesiastical Greek it stands for the order of the Holy Communion, the ancient liturgies; it is sometimes used loosely for any set form of public prayer. The analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, Where St. Paul exhorts Christians to present their bodies a living sacrifice, suggests that here the Philippians are regarded as priests (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-5.htm">1 Peter 3:5</a>), offering the sacrifice of their faith, their hearts, themselves, in the ministrations of the spiritual priesthood; St. Paul's blood being represented as the accompanying drink offering. Others, comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16</a>, where also sacrificial words are used, regard St. Paul himself as the ministering priest, and understand the metaphor of a priest slain at the altar, his blood being shed while he is offering the sacrifice of their faith. <span class="cmt_word">I joy, and rejoice with you all</span>. Meyer, Bengel, and others prefer "congratulate" as the rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span> "I rejoice with you." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:12-18 We must be diligent in the use of all the means which lead to our salvation, persevering therein to the end. With great care, lest, with all our advantages, we should come short. Work out your salvation, for it is God who worketh in you. This encourages us to do our utmost, because our labour shall not be in vain: we must still depend on the grace of God. The working of God's grace in us, is to quicken and engage our endeavours. God's good-will to us, is the cause of his good work in us. Do your duty without murmurings. Do it, and do not find fault with it. Mind your work, and do not quarrel with it. By peaceableness; give no just occasion of offence. The children of God should differ from the sons of men. The more perverse others are, the more careful we should be to keep ourselves blameless and harmless. The doctrine and example of consistent believers will enlighten others, and direct their way to Christ and holiness, even as the light-house warns mariners to avoid rocks, and directs their course into the harbour. Let us try thus to shine. The gospel is the word of life, it makes known to us eternal life through Jesus Christ. Running, denotes earnestness and vigour, continual pressing forward; labouring, denotes constancy, and close application. It is the will of God that believers should be much in rejoicing; and those who are so happy as to have good ministers, have great reason to rejoice with them.</body></html>
