The same is the case in the First Epistle to the Thessalonians (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm" title="Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:">Philippians 1:1</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-2.htm" title="Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.">Philippians 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-6.htm" title="Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.">Philippians 3:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">That I also may be of good comfort.</span>--The words express some anxiety, but greater confidence, as to the news which Timothy on returning was likely to bring. We have instances of a similar but far stronger anxiety of affection in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-13.htm" title="I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from there into Macedonia.">2Corinthians 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/7-6.htm" title="Nevertheless God, that comforts those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;">2Corinthians 7:6-7</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm" title="Why when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;">1Thessalonians 3:1-9</a>. In regard to the Philippians it might exist in detail, but was swallowed up in confidence on all main points.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you</span>; read and translate, with R.V., <span class="accented">I hope in the Lord Jesus.</span> He had urged them, in Ver. 12, not to depend too much on human teachers; but "much more in nay absence work out your own salvation;" still he will give them what help he can - he will send Timotheus. <span class="accented">In the Lord</span> Jesus (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-8.htm">Philippians 1:8, 14</a>; 3:24). Bishop Lightfoot has a beautiful note here: "The Christian is a part of Christ, a member of his body. His every thought and word and deed proceed from Christ, as the center of volition. Thus he loves in the Lord, he hopes in the Lord, he boasts in the Lord, he labors in the Lord. He has one guiding principle in acting and forbearing to act, 'only in the Lord' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-39.htm">1 Corinthians 7:39</a>)."That I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. Timothy is both to assist the Philippians by his presence and counsel, and to comfort St. Paul by bringing back tidings of their Christian life. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:19-30 It is best with us, when our duty becomes natural to us. Naturally, that is, sincerely, and not in pretence only; with a willing heart and upright views. We are apt to prefer our own credit, ease, and safety, before truth, holiness, and duty; but Timothy did not so. Paul desired liberty, not that he might take pleasure, but that he might do good. Epaphroditus was willing to go to the Philippians, that he might be comforted with those who had sorrowed for him when he was sick. It seems, his illness was caused by the work of God. The apostle urges them to love him the more on that account. It is doubly pleasant to have our mercies restored by God, after great danger of their removal; and this should make them more valued. What is given in answer to prayer, should be received with great thankfulness and joy.</body></html>
