Of this He stripped Himself in the Incarnation, taking on Him the "form (or, <span class= "ital">nature</span>) of a servant" of God. He resumed it for a moment in the Transfiguration; He was crowned with it anew at the Ascension.<p><span class= "bld">Made in the likeness of man.</span>--This clause, at first sight, seems to weaken the previous clause, for it does not distinctly express our Lord's true humanity. But we note that the phrase is "the likeness of men," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of men in general, men as they actually are. Hence the key to the meaning is to be found in such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm" title="For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:">Romans 8:3</a>, God sent His own Son in "the likeness of sinful flesh;" or <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-17.htm" title="Why in all things it behooved him to be made like to his brothers, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.">Hebrews 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-15.htm" title="For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.">Hebrews 4:15</a>, "It behoved Him to be made like unto His brethren," "in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin." It would have been an infinite humiliation to have assumed humanity, even in unique and visible glory; but our Lord went beyond this, by deigning to seem like other men in all things, one only of the multitude, and that, too, in a station, which confused Him with the commoner types of mankind. The truth of His humanity is expressed in the phrase "form of a servant;" its unique and ideal character is glanced at when it is said to have worn only the "likeness of men."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But made himself of no reputation</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">but emptied himself</span>; not, he indeed, of the Godhead, which could not be, but of its manifestation, its glory. This he did once for all, as the aorist implies, at the Incarnation. The word "emptied' involves a previous fullness, "a precedent plenitude" (Pearson on the Creed, 2:25). The Divine majesty of which he emptied himself was his own, his own rightful prerogative; and his humiliation was his own voluntary <span class="accented">act - he</span> emptied <span class="accented">himself.</span> "He used his equality with God as an opportunity, not for self-exaltation, but for self-abasement" (Alford). "<span class="accented">Manebat plenus</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, et tureen perinde se gessit ac si esset" (Bengel). And took upon him the form of a servant; rather, as R.V., taking the form. The two clauses refer to the same act of self-humiliation regarded from its two sides. He emptied himself of his glory, taking at the same time the form (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> as in Ver. 6, the essential attributes) of a servant, literally, of a slave. Observe, he was originally (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) in the form of God; he took (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>) the form of a slave. The Godhead was his by right, the manhood by his own voluntary act: both are equally real; he is perfect God and perfect Man. Isaiah prophesied of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49.htm">Isaiah 49</a> and Isaiah 52; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-33.htm">Acts 2:33</a>, in the Greek or R.V.) as the Servant of Jehovah; he came to do the Father's will, submitting his own will in all things: "Not as I will, but as thou wilt" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-27.htm">Matthew 20:27, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-44.htm">Mark 10:44, 45</a><span class="cmt_word">). And was made in the likeness of men</span>; translate, <span class="accented">becoming</span>, or, as R.V., <span class="accented">being made</span> (aorist participle). This clause is another description of the one act of the Incarnation he <span class="accented">was</span> God, he <span class="accented">became</span> man. Form (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>) asserts the reality of our Lord's human nature. Likeness (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) refers only to external appearance: this word, of course, does not imply that our Lord was not truly man, but, as Chrysostom says ('Hom.,' 8:247), he was more. than man; "We are soul and body, but he is God and soul and body." <span class="accented">The likeness of men</span>; because Christ is the Representative of humanity: he took upon him, not a human person, but human nature. He is one person in two natures. As Bishop Lightfoot says, "Christ, as the second Adam, represents, not the individual man, but the human race." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-11 The example of our Lord Jesus Christ is set before us. We must resemble him in his life, if we would have the benefit of his death. Notice the two natures of Christ; his Divine nature, and human nature. Who being in the form of God, partaking the Divine nature, as the eternal and only-begotten Son of God, Joh 1:1, had not thought it a robbery to be equal with God, and to receive Divine worship from men. His human nature; herein he became like us in all things except sin. Thus low, of his own will, he stooped from the glory he had with the Father before the world was. Christ's two states, of humiliation and exaltation, are noticed. Christ not only took upon him the likeness and fashion, or form of a man, but of one in a low state; not appearing in splendour. His whole life was a life of poverty and suffering. But the lowest step was his dying the death of the cross, the death of a malefactor and a slave; exposed to public hatred and scorn. The exaltation was of Christ's human nature, in union with the Divine. At the name of Jesus, not the mere sound of the word, but the authority of Jesus, all should pay solemn homage. It is to the glory of God the Father, to confess that Jesus Christ is Lord; for it is his will, that all men should honour the Son as they honour the Father, Joh 5:23.
