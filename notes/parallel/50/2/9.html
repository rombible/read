It raises Him to the throne of the Mediatorial kingdom, on which He entered by the Ascension, sitting at the right hand of God till He has put all enemies under His feet, and then ready "to deliver up the kingdom to the Father, that God may be all in all." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-24.htm" title="Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1Corinthians 15:24-28</a>.) For it is the "Son of Man" who "cometh in the clouds of heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-64.htm" title="Jesus said to him, You have said: nevertheless I say to you, Hereafter shall you see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.">Matthew 26:64</a>), and has "authority to execute judgment" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-27.htm" title="And has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.">John 5:27</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Hath given him a name.</span>--Or, rather, <span class= "ital">the Name above every name.</span> "The Name" (for this seems to be the best reading) is clearly "the Name" of God. It is properly the name Jehovah, held in the extremest literal reverence by the Jews, and it came to signify (almost like "the Word") the revelation of the presence of God. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/19-12.htm" title="His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.">Revelation 19:12-13</a>, where "the name which no man knew but Himself" is the "Word of God." This is, indeed, made clear by the following verse; for the adoration there described is in the original passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-23.htm" title="I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That to me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.">Isaiah 45:23</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-11.htm" title="For it is written, As I live, said the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.">Romans 14:11</a>), claimed as the sole due of God Himself. The name JESUS, "Jehovah the Saviour" (like "Jehovah our Righteousness," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm" title="In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.">Jeremiah 23:6</a>), does contain, as an integral element, the incommunicable name of God, while the addition of "Saviour" points to the true humanity. Therefore in that Name, of Him who is at once God and Man, "every knee is to bow" with direct worship to Him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him</span>. The exaltation is the reward of the humiliation: "He that humbleth himself shall be exalted." Better, as R.V., <span class="accented">highly exalted.</span> The aorist (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) refers to the historical facts of the Resurrection and Ascension<span class="cmt_word">. And given him a Name which is above every name</span>; read and translate, as R.V., <span class="accented">and gave unto him the Name.</span> The two aorist verbs, "highly exalted" and "freely gave" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>), refer to the time of our Lord's resurrection and ascension. He voluntarily assumed a subordinate position; God the Father exalted him. We must read, with the best manuscripts, <span class="accented">the</span> Name. This seems to mean, not the name Jesus, which was given him at his circumcision, in accordance with the angel's message; but the name Lord or Jehovah (comp. Ver. 11), which was indeed his before his incarnation, but was given (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth") to Jesus Christ, the incarnate Son, God and Man in one Person. Or more probably, perhaps, the word "Name" is used here, as so often in the Hebrew Scriptures, for the majesty, glory, dignity, of the Godhead. Compare the oft-repeated words of the psahnist, "Praise the <span class="accented">Name</span> of the Lord." So Gesenius, in his Hebrew lexicon on the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> he explains the Name of the Lord as (b) Jehovah as being called on and praised by men; and (c) the Deity as being present with mortals (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-4.htm">Hebrews 1:4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-11 The example of our Lord Jesus Christ is set before us. We must resemble him in his life, if we would have the benefit of his death. Notice the two natures of Christ; his Divine nature, and human nature. Who being in the form of God, partaking the Divine nature, as the eternal and only-begotten Son of God, Joh 1:1, had not thought it a robbery to be equal with God, and to receive Divine worship from men. His human nature; herein he became like us in all things except sin. Thus low, of his own will, he stooped from the glory he had with the Father before the world was. Christ's two states, of humiliation and exaltation, are noticed. Christ not only took upon him the likeness and fashion, or form of a man, but of one in a low state; not appearing in splendour. His whole life was a life of poverty and suffering. But the lowest step was his dying the death of the cross, the death of a malefactor and a slave; exposed to public hatred and scorn. The exaltation was of Christ's human nature, in union with the Divine. At the name of Jesus, not the mere sound of the word, but the authority of Jesus, all should pay solemn homage. It is to the glory of God the Father, to confess that Jesus Christ is Lord; for it is his will, that all men should honour the Son as they honour the Father, Joh 5:23. Here we see such motives to self-denying love as nothing else can supply. Do we thus love and obey the Son of God?</body></html>
