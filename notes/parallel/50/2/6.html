Hence it calls attention to the essential being of Christ, corresponding to the idea embodied in the name Jehovah, and thus implying what is more fully expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>. (2) The word "form" (which, except for a casual use in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-12.htm" title="After that he appeared in another form to two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.">Mark 16:12</a>, is found only in this passage of the New Testament) is to be carefully distinguished from "fashion." There can be no doubt that in classical Greek it describes the actual specific character, which (like the structure of a material substance) makes each being what it is; and this same idea is always conveyed in the New Testament by the compound words in which the root "form" is found (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm" title="For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-2.htm" title="And be not conformed to this world: but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.">Romans 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-18.htm" title="But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.">2Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-19.htm" title="My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,">Galatians 4:19</a>). (3) On the other hand, the word "fashion," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-31.htm" title="And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passes away.">1Corinthians 7:31</a> ("the fashion of this world passeth away"), denotes the mere outward appearance (which we frequently designate as "form"), as will be seen also in its compounds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/11-13.htm" title="For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.">2Corinthians 11:13-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-14.htm" title="As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:">1Peter 1:14</a>). The two words are seen in juxtaposition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-2.htm" title="And be not conformed to this world: but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.">Romans 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-21.htm" title="Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.">Philippians 3:21</a> (where see Notes). Hence, in this passage the "being in the form of God," describes our Lord's essential, and therefore eternal, being in the true nature of God; while the "taking on Him the form of a servant" similarly refers to His voluntary assumption of the true nature of man.<p>It should be noticed that, whereas in St. Paul's earlier Epistles, in which he cared not "to know anything save Jesus Christ," and "Him as crucified," the main idea is always of our Lord as the mediator between man and God, yet in the later Epistles (as here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-20.htm" title="Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,">Ephesians 1:20-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/2-9.htm" title=" For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.">Colossians 2:9-11</a>; to which we may add <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2-4</a>) stress is laid, sometimes (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>), on His gathering all things in heaven and earth unto Himself; sometimes, even more explicitly, on His partaking of the divine nature, and (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-17.htm" title=" And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.">Colossians 1:17</a>) of His possessing the divine attribute of creation. All this naturally leads up to the great declaration of His true and perfect Godhead in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1-13</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Thought it not robbery to be equal with God.</span>--There are two main interpretations of this passage; first, the interpretation given in our version, which makes it simply an explanation and enforcement of the words "being in the form of God"; secondly, the translation <span class= "ital">thought it not a prize to be grasped at to be equal with God, </span>which begins in it the statement of our Lord's voluntary self-humiliation, to be completed in the words, "but emptied Himself of glory." The former preserves the literal translation of the original word "robbery;" the latter, in accordance with a not uncommon usage, makes it equivalent to "the thing snatched at," and if this be allowed, has abundant examples in other writings to support the meaning thus given to the whole phrase. Either interpretation yields good sense and sound doctrine; neither does violence to the general context. But the latter is to be preferred; first (1) because it suits better the idea of the passage, which is to emphasise the reality of our Lord's humility, and preserves the opposition implied in the "but" following; (2) because it has the great preponderance of the ancient Greek interpreters in its favour; (3) because it can, on the whole, appeal more confidently to ordinary usage of the phrase. The sense is that, being in the form of God, and therefore having equality with God, He set no store on that equality, as a glory to Himself, compared with the power of giving salvation to all men, which He is pleased to consider a new joy and glory.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who, being in the form of God</span>.

What does the word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> form, mean here? It occurs twice in this passage - Ver. 6, "form of God;" and Ver. 7, "form of a servant;" it is contrasted with <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> fashion, in Ver. 8. In the Aristotelian philosophy (<span class="accented">vide</span> ' De Anima,' 2:1, 2) <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>. is used almost in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> as that which makes a thing to be what it is, the sum of its essential attributes: it is the form, as the expression of those essential attributes, the permanent, constant form; not the fleeting, outward <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, or fashion. St. Paul seems to make a somewhat similar distinction between the two words. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> (or its derivatives) is used of the deep inner change of heart, the change which is described in Holy Scripture as a new creation; while <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is used of the changeful fashion of the world and agreement with it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-31.htm">1 Corinthians 7:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>). Then, when St. Paul tells us that Christ Jesus, being first in the form of God, took the form of a servant, the meaning must be that he possessed originally the essential attributes of Deity, and assumed in addition the essential attributes of humanity. He was perfect God; he became perfect (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>). For a fuller discussion of the meanings of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, see Bishop Lightfoot's detached note ('Philippians,' p. 127), and Archbishop Trench, 'Synonyms of the New Testament,' sect. 70. Thought it not robbery to be equal with God; R.V. "counted it not a prize [margin, 'a thing to be grasped'] to be on an equality with God." These two renderings represent two conflicting interpretations of this difficult passage. Do the words mean that Christ asserted his essential Godhead ("thought it not robbery to be equal with God," as A.V.), or that he did not cling to the glory of the Divine majesty ("counted it not a prize," as R.V.)? Both statements are true in fact. The grammatical form of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which properly implies an action or process, favors the first view, which seems to be adopted by most of the ancient versions and by most of the Latin Fathers. On the other hand, the form of the word does not exclude the passive interpretation; many words of the same termination have a passive meaning, and <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> itself is used in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> by Eusebius, Cyril of Alexandria, and a writer in the 'Catena Possini' on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42</a> (the three passages are quoted by Bishop Lightfoot, <span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">loco</span>). The Greek Fathers (as Chrysostom <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, etc.) generally adopt this interpretation. And the context seems to require it. The aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> points to an act, the act of abnegation; not to a state, the continued assertion. The conjunction "but" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span>) implies that the two sentences are opposed to one another. He did not grasp, but, on the contrary, he emptied himself. The first interpretation involves the tacit insertion of "nevertheless;" he asserted his equality, but nevertheless, etc. And the whole stress is laid on the Lord's humility and unselfishness. It is true that this second interpretation does not so distinctly assert the divinity of our Lord, already sufficiently asserted in the first clause, "being in the form of God." But it implies it. Not to grasp at equality with God would not be an instance of humility, but merely the absence of mad impiety, in one who was not himself Divine. On the whole, then, we prefer the second interpretation. Though he was born the beginning in the form of God, he did not regard equality with God as a thing to be grasped, a prize to be tenaciously retained. Not so good is the view of Meyer and others: "Jesus Christ, when he found himself in the heavenly mode of existence of Divine glory, did not permit himself the thought of using his equality with God for the purpose of seizing possessions and honor for himself on earth." The R.V. rendering of the last words of the clause," to be on an equality," is nearer to the Greek and better than the A.V., "to be equal with God." Christ was equal with God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-18.htm">John 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>). He did not cling to the outward manifestation of that equality. The adverbial form <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> implies the state or mode of equality rather than the equality itself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-11 The example of our Lord Jesus Christ is set before us. We must resemble him in his life, if we would have the benefit of his death. Notice the two natures of Christ; his Divine nature, and human nature. Who being in the form of God, partaking the Divine nature, as the eternal and only-begotten Son of God, Joh 1:1, had not thought it a robbery to be equal with God, and to receive Divine worship from men. His human nature; herein he became like us in all things except sin. Thus low, of his own will, he stooped from the glory he had with the Father before the world was. Christ's two states, of humiliation and exaltation, are noticed. Christ not only took upon him the likeness and fashion, or form of a man, but of one in a low state; not appearing in splendour. His whole life was a life of poverty and suffering. But the lowest step was his dying the death of the cross, the death of a malefactor and a slave; exposed to public hatred and scorn. The exaltation was of Christ's human nature, in union with the Divine. At the name of Jesus, not the mere sound of the word, but the authority of Jesus, all should pay solemn homage. It is to the glory of God the Father, to confess that Jesus Christ is Lord; for it is his will, that all men should honour the Son as they honour the Father, Joh 5:23. Here we see such motives to self-denying love as nothing else can supply. Do we thus love and obey the Son of God?</body></html>
