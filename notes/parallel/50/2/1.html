Out of it comes naturally the "comfort of love," that is, as always, the deep and thankful sense of comfort in His love, overflowing into comfort, lovingly given to our brethren. On this "encouragement" in Christ, both received and given out to others, St. Paul dwells at length (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;">2Corinthians 1:3-7</a>). (2) Next, he speaks of "communion of the Spirit" (the very word used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-13.htm" title="All the saints salute you.">2Corinthians 13:13</a>), by which, indeed, we are brought into that unity with Christ; and of this, still keeping to the main idea of love, he makes the manifestation to be in "bowels and mercies"--that is, both in strong affection, and in that peculiar form of affection which is directed towards suffering, viz., compassion or pity. The whole passage (like <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/4-8.htm" title="Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.">Philippians 4:8-9</a>) is full of a grave and persuasive eloquence characteristic of this Epistle. No absolute distinction is to be drawn between the two elements of the sentence; but it may be noted that the "consolation in Christ" is exhibited in the action which visibly follows His divine example, "the communion with the Holy Spirit" is shown by the inner emotion, not seen, but felt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If there be therefore, any consolation in Christ</span>. Mark the fervor of the apostle. <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c9;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> (Chrysostom). He appeals to the Christian experience of the Philippians; if these experiences are real, as they are; facts verified in the believer's consciousness; not talk, not mere forms of speech, - then fulfill ye my joy. <span class="accented">Consolation</span>; perhaps "exhortation" is the more suitable rendering in this place: if the presence of Christ, if communion with Christ, hath power to stir the heart, to stimulate the emotions, to constrain the will. If any comfort of love; comfort springing out of love. Love is the subjective result of the presence of Christ as an objective reality, and with love comes comfort (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-3.htm">1 Corinthians 14:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">If any fellowship of the Spirit</span>. If the indwelling of the Holy Ghost be true, a felt reality in the Christian life. Not, as some understand, "If there be any fellowship of spirit among themselves." <span class="cmt_word">If any bowels and mercies</span>. Bowels (see note on Philippians 1:8), the seat of the feelings of compassion; mercies, those feelings themselves. The pronoun "any," according to the reading of all the best manuscripts, is masculine singular; the word "bowels," being neuter plural <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> If St. Paul really wrote thus, we must suppose that the warmth of his feelings suddenly led him to substitute <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> for some other word originally in his thoughts. "Under any circumstances," says Bishop Lightfoot, "the reading <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is a valuable testimony to the scrupulous fidelity of the early transcribers, who copied the text as they found it, even when it contained readings so manifestly difficult." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-4 Here are further exhortations to Christian duties; to like-mindedness and lowly-mindedness, according to the example of the Lord Jesus. Kindness is the law of Christ's kingdom, the lesson of his school, the livery of his family. Several motives to brotherly love are mentioned. If you expect or experience the benefit of God's compassions to yourselves, be compassionate one to another. It is the joy of ministers to see people like-minded. Christ came to humble us, let there not be among us a spirit of pride. We must be severe upon our own faults, and quick in observing our own defects, but ready to make favourable allowances for others. We must kindly care for others, but not be busy-bodies in other men's matters. Neither inward nor outward peace can be enjoyed, without lowliness of mind.</body></html>
