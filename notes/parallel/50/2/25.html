But it was a common name; hence any identification with the Epaphras of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-7.htm" title=" As you also learned of Epaphras our dear fellow servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;">Colossians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-12.htm" title=" Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.">Colossians 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-23.htm" title="There salute you Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;">Philemon 1:23</a>, is, to say the least, extremely precarious. It is hardly likely that one who was a native Colossian would be a resident and chosen messenger of Philippi. The three titles here given him are closely joined together in the original, and form a kind of climax--"brother" in a common Christianity, "fellow-worker" in the service of Christ, "fellow-soldier" in the "hardness" of daring and suffering, which the warfare of the Cross implies. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/2-3.htm" title="You therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.">2Timothy 2:3-4</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Your messenger.</span>--The original word is <span class= "ital">apostle;</span> and by some interpreters, ancient and modern, it has been thought that it is intended here to designate the chief pastor--or, in the modern sense, the bishop--of the Philippian Church (as probably is the case with the "angels" of the churches in the Apocalypse); and the word "your" is then explained in the same sense as the words "of the Gentiles" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-13.htm" title="For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify my office:">Romans 11:13</a>. But this is very unlikely, (1) because there seems to be no example to confirm the statement that the chief pastor of a church was ever called its "apostle;" (2) because the character of the apostolate, being general and evangelistic, was very different from that of the local and pastoral episcopate; (3) because in this passage the word is inseparably connected with the following "and minister to my needs," showing the latter phrase to be explanatory of the previous word; (4) because the style of commendation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-29.htm" title="Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:">Philippians 2:29</a> is hardly suitable as applied to one whose office alone should have commanded respect. Our version is, therefore, correct in rendering it "messenger," just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-23.htm" title="Whether any do inquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellow helper concerning you: or our brothers be inquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.">2Corinthians 8:23</a> ("the messengers of the churches"), where there is a similar reference to the transmission of alms.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus</span>; translate, <span class="accented">but I count it necessary.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f29;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> here and in Ver. 28 are epistolary aorists; they point, that is, to the time of reading the letter, not to that of writing it; and are therefore to be rendered by the English present. Epaphroditus is mentioned only in this Epistle. Epaphras is the contracted form, but the name is a common one, and there is no evidence of his identity with the Epaphras of Colossians and Philemon. He seems to have been the bearer of this Epistle. St. Paul felt that to come himself, or even to send Timothy, might possibly not be in his power; he thought it necessary, a matter of duty, to send Epaphroditus at once<span class="cmt_word">. My brother, and companion in labor, and fellow-soldier</span>. Mark how the epithets rise one above another; they imply fellowship in religion, in work, in endurance. <span class="cmt_word">But your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants</span>. "Your" refers to both clauses; "your messenger, and (your) minister to my need." Epaphroditus had brought to St. Paul the contributions of the Philippians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>). Some think that the word rendered "messenger" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, literally "apostle") means that Epaphroditus was the apostle, that is, the bishop of the Philippian Church. It may be so (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>, and note); but there is no proof of the establishment of any diocesan bishops, except St. James at Jerusalem, at so early a period. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. both here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-23.htm">2 Corinthians 8:23</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>), is probably used in its first meaning in the sense of messenger, or delegate. The Greek word for minister, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, seems to imply, like <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in Ver. 30, that St. Paul regarded the alms of the Philippians as an offering to God, ministered by Epaphroditus. (But see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-6.htm">Romans 13:6</a>, also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-43.htm">2 Kings 4:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-15.htm">2 Kings 6:15</a>, etc. in the Greek.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:19-30 It is best with us, when our duty becomes natural to us. Naturally, that is, sincerely, and not in pretence only; with a willing heart and upright views. We are apt to prefer our own credit, ease, and safety, before truth, holiness, and duty; but Timothy did not so. Paul desired liberty, not that he might take pleasure, but that he might do good. Epaphroditus was willing to go to the Philippians, that he might be comforted with those who had sorrowed for him when he was sick. It seems, his illness was caused by the work of God. The apostle urges them to love him the more on that account. It is doubly pleasant to have our mercies restored by God, after great danger of their removal; and this should make them more valued. What is given in answer to prayer, should be received with great thankfulness and joy.</body></html>
