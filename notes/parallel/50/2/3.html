"For," he adds, "each will esteem other better than himself," or, rather, will hold that his neighbour is worthy of higher consideration and a higher place of dignity than himself (comp. the use of the word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm" title="Let every soul be subject to the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.">Romans 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-13.htm" title="Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;">1Peter 2:13</a>, of temporal dignity); for the idea is of the ascription to others, not of moral superiority, but of higher place and honour. Self-assertion will be entirely overborne. So he teaches us elsewhere that "charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/13-4.htm" title="Charity suffers long, and is kind; charity envies not; charity braggs not itself, is not puffed up,">1Corinthians 13:4-5</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let nothing be done through strife or vain-glory</span>. Not "strife," but "faction," as R.V. The word is the same as that rendered "contention" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-10.htm">Philippians 1:10</a>, where see note. Party spirit is one of the greatest dangers in running the Christian race. Love is the characteristic Christian grace; party spirit and vain-glory too often lead professing Christians to break the law of love. <span class="cmt_word">But in lowiness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves</span>. In <span class="accented">your</span> lowliness; the article seems to have a possessive sense, the lowliness characteristic of Christians, which you as Christians possess. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> an exclusively New Testament word: the grace was new, and the word was new. The adjective <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> in classical Greek is used as a term of reproach - abject, mean. The life of Christ ("I am meek and lowly in heart") and the teaching of Christ ("Blessed are the poor in spirit") have raised lowliness to a new position, as one of the chief features in the true Christian character. Here St. Paul bids us, as a discipline of humility, to look at our own faults and at the good points in the character of others (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-10.htm">Romans 12:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-4 Here are further exhortations to Christian duties; to like-mindedness and lowly-mindedness, according to the example of the Lord Jesus. Kindness is the law of Christ's kingdom, the lesson of his school, the livery of his family. Several motives to brotherly love are mentioned. If you expect or experience the benefit of God's compassions to yourselves, be compassionate one to another. It is the joy of ministers to see people like-minded. Christ came to humble us, let there not be among us a spirit of pride. We must be severe upon our own faults, and quick in observing our own defects, but ready to make favourable allowances for others. We must kindly care for others, but not be busy-bodies in other men's matters. Neither inward nor outward peace can be enjoyed, without lowliness of mind.</body></html>
