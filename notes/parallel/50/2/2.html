St. Paul begins with the exhortation not uncommon from him, to be likeminded," that is, to have true sympathy (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-16.htm" title="Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.">Romans 12:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-5.htm" title="Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be like minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:">Romans 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-11.htm" title="Finally, brothers, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.">2Corinthians 13:11</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-16.htm" title="Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.">Philippians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-2.htm" title="I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.">Philippians 4:2</a>); which he naturally strengthens by the addition of "having the same love" (that is, a mutual love), to show that the sympathy is to be one not only of mind but of heart. But this does not satisfy him: he rises to the further exhortation to perfect "union of soul" (which is the proper rendering for "being of one accord") in which they shall not only be likeminded, but (in a phrase peculiar to this passage) be actually "of one mind," living in one another, each sinking his individuality in the enthusiasm of a common love.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fulfil ye my joy</span>. St. Paul has already (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-4.htm">Philippians 1:4</a>) spoken of his joy derived from the life and conduct of the Philippian Christians; now he asks them to complete his joy by living in unity. There were disagreements among them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-2.htm">Philippians 4:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That ye be like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind</span>. The apostle's earnestness leads him to dwell on the idea of unity, clothing the one thought again and again in different words. <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> says Chrysostom, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>. "Having the same love:" loving and beloved; <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (Chrysostom). "Being of one accord <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>," Bishop Ellicott renders more literally, "With accordant souls minding the one thing." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-4 Here are further exhortations to Christian duties; to like-mindedness and lowly-mindedness, according to the example of the Lord Jesus. Kindness is the law of Christ's kingdom, the lesson of his school, the livery of his family. Several motives to brotherly love are mentioned. If you expect or experience the benefit of God's compassions to yourselves, be compassionate one to another. It is the joy of ministers to see people like-minded. Christ came to humble us, let there not be among us a spirit of pride. We must be severe upon our own faults, and quick in observing our own defects, but ready to make favourable allowances for others. We must kindly care for others, but not be busy-bodies in other men's matters. Neither inward nor outward peace can be enjoyed, without lowliness of mind.</body></html>
