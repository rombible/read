Timothy was at Philippi with St. Paul on his first visit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/16-12.htm" title="And from there to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.">Acts 16:12-40</a>); we find him sent to Thessalonica shortly after (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm" title="And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:">1Thessalonians 3:2</a>), and he probably then paid a second visit to Philippi; from Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-22.htm" title="So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered to him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.">Acts 19:22</a>) he is sent again to Macedonia; and with St. Paul on the way to Jerusalem he was at Philippi once more (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4-6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">As a son with the father.</span>--The original construction is curiously broken here. It runs, <span class= "ital">As a son to a father</span>--as though St. Paul was going to speak of Timothy's dutiful ministration and following of his example; but then the sentence changes, in a characteristic humility, and makes Timothy and himself merely fellow-servants--<span class= "ital">he served with me in the gospel.</span> If we may judge of Timothy's character from the general character of St. Paul's directions to him in the Pastoral Epistles, and especially the significant exhortation, "Let no man despise thy youth, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-12.htm" title="Let no man despise your youth; but be you an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.">1Timothy 4:12</a>), it would seem to have been gentle and warm-hearted rather than commanding. Hence, perhaps, the necessity for this singularly emphatic commendation of him. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-10.htm" title="Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do.">1Corinthians 16:10</a>, "If Timotheus come, see that he be with you without fear.")<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But ye know the proof of him</span>.

Naturally, that is, sincerely, and not in pretence only; with a willing heart and upright views. We are apt to prefer our own credit, ease, and safety, before truth, holiness, and duty; but Timothy did not so. Paul desired liberty, not that he might take pleasure, but that he might do good. Epaphroditus was willing to go to the Philippians, that he might be comforted with those who had sorrowed for him when he was sick. It seems, his illness was caused by the work of God. The apostle urges them to love him the more on that account. It is doubly pleasant to have our mercies restored by God, after great danger of their removal; and this should make them more valued. What is given in answer to prayer, should be received with great thankfulness and joy.</body></html>
