"In the Name" is the phrase constantly used for worship of God. "I will lift up my hands in Thy Name" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-4.htm" title="Thus will I bless you while I live: I will lift up my hands in your name.">Psalm 63:4</a>). It denotes worship to Christ, not through Him.<p><span class= "bld">Of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth.</span>--For "things" we may better substitute <span class= "ital">beings, </span>for the reference is properly to personal beings; although in some sense "All the works of the Lord bless the Lord, praise Him and magnify Him for ever." (Comp. here <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-13.htm" title="And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be to him that sits on the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever.">Revelation 5:13</a>, "Every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth . . . heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever." See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-20.htm" title="Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,">Ephesians 1:20-21</a>, and Notes there.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow</span>; translate, <span class="accented">in the name</span>, not at (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>, quoted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-10.htm">Romans 14:10, 11</a>). The words may mean, either that all prayer must be offered to God in the name of Jesus, through his mediation; or that all creation must offer prayer to him. Both alternatives are true, and perhaps both are covered by the words; but the second seems to be principally intended (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-4.htm">Psalm 63:4</a>, "I will lift up my hands in thy Name." Comp. also (in the Greek) Psalm 43:9; 104:3; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-44.htm">1 Kings 8:44</a>; also the common Septuagint phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). Observe, the words are, not "the name Jesus," but "the name of Jesus;" the name, that is, which God freely gave to him (Ver. 9), It is the name which is above every name, that is, the majesty, the glory of Jesus, which is to be the object of Christian worship. The end of the whole passage being the exaltation of Jesus, it seems more natural to understand this verse of worship paid to Jesus than of worship offered through him to God the Father. Observe also that the words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>) on which this passage is formed are the words of Jehovah: "Unto <span class="accented">me</span> every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear." They could not be used without impiety of any but God<span class="cmt_word">. Of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth</span>. Perhaps the angels, the living, and the dead; or, more probably (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-13.htm">Revelation 5:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21, 22</a>), all creation, animate and inanimate, is represented as uniting in the universal adoration. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-11 The example of our Lord Jesus Christ is set before us. We must resemble him in his life, if we would have the benefit of his death. Notice the two natures of Christ; his Divine nature, and human nature. Who being in the form of God, partaking the Divine nature, as the eternal and only-begotten Son of God, Joh 1:1, had not thought it a robbery to be equal with God, and to receive Divine worship from men. His human nature; herein he became like us in all things except sin. Thus low, of his own will, he stooped from the glory he had with the Father before the world was. Christ's two states, of humiliation and exaltation, are noticed. Christ not only took upon him the likeness and fashion, or form of a man, but of one in a low state; not appearing in splendour. His whole life was a life of poverty and suffering. But the lowest step was his dying the death of the cross, the death of a malefactor and a slave; exposed to public hatred and scorn. The exaltation was of Christ's human nature, in union with the Divine. At the name of Jesus, not the mere sound of the word, but the authority of Jesus, all should pay solemn homage. It is to the glory of God the Father, to confess that Jesus Christ is Lord; for it is his will, that all men should honour the Son as they honour the Father, Joh 5:23. Here we see such motives to self-denying love as nothing else can supply. Do we thus love and obey the Son of God?</body></html>
