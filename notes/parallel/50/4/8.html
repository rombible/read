The exhortation is marked by the reiteration of affectionate earnestness, in which, however, we may (as always) trace an underlying method. In each pair of epithets there seems to be reference both to an inner reality and to the outward development, by which it is at once manifested and perfected. In both St. Paul would have them grow up to perfection.<p>(8) <span class= "bld">True . . .</span> <span class= "bld">honest</span> (better, <span class= "ital">venerable;</span> see margin).--Truth is the inherent likeness to God, who is Truth. Whatever is true in itself is also "venerable"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as the original word, usually rendered "grave" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-8.htm" title="Likewise must the deacons be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;">1Timothy 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-11.htm" title="Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.">1Timothy 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-2.htm" title="That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.">Titus 2:2</a>) etymologically signifies, it claims a share of the reverence due primarily to God; it has in it a certain majesty commanding worship.<p><span class= "bld">Just . . . pure.</span>--"Just" is (as St. Paul's habitual usage of "justify" shows) righteous in act and word, as tested by the declared will of man or God. "Pure" is righteous in essence, in the thought, which cannot be thus tested--showing itself in what is just and indeed perfected thereby, but in itself something holier still.<p><span class= "bld">Lovely . . . of good report.</span>--Both words are peculiar to this passage: in both we pass from truth and righteousness to love. "Lovely" is that which deserves love. The phrase "of good report" represents a Greek word which is commonly used for "fair-sounding," or "auspicious" and "acceptable." It is therefore the outward expression of what is "lovely," winning the acceptance which loveliness deserves.<p><span class= "bld">If there be any virtue, and . . . praise.</span>--Still there is the same antithesis--"virtue" is the inherent quality; "praise" is virtue's due. But the word "virtue," so frequent in human morality, is hardly ever used in Scripture. In fact, the only other case of application to man is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-5.htm" title="And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;">2Peter 1:5</a>, where it stands between "faith" and "knowledge," and seems specially to signify the energy of practice by which faith grows into knowledge. The reason of this is clear. To the very name of "virtue" clings the idea of self-reliance--such self-reliance as the Stoic philosophy (then the only dominant system of Roman opinion which had any nobleness in it) made its essential characteristic; and that idea is, of course, foreign to the whole conception of Christian morality. The occurrence, therefore, here of an appeal to "virtue" and to "praise" seems strange. We notice, however, that it is introduced by a new phrase of mere hypothesis ("if there be," &c.), which may be taken to mark it as an outlying consideration, occupying a less firm and important ground. Probably, therefore, it is an appeal to the lower conceptions of the society, so characteristically Roman, around them: "Nay, even if there be any truth in the virtue and praise of mere human morality," &c.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true</span>. He repeats the "finally" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-1.htm">Philippians 2:1</a>, He again and again prepares to close his Epistle, but cannot at once bid farewell to his beloved Philippians. He urges them to fill their thoughts with things good and holy. Christ is the Truth: all that is true comes from him; the false, the vain, is of the earth, earthy. Perhaps the verb (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>) may be emphatic. Sceptics may deny the existence of absolute truth; men may scoffingly ask, "What is truth?" Truth is real, and it is found in Christ, the Truth. <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever things are honest</span>. The word (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;</span>) occurs only here and four times in the pastoral Epistles. It is a word difficult translate. "Honourable" or" reverend" (the renderings of the R.V.) are better equivalents than "honest." It points to a Christian decorum, a Christian self-respect, which is quite consistent with true humility, for it is a reverence for the temple of God. <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever things are just</span>; rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">righteous</span>, in the widest meaning. <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever things are pure</span>; not only chaste, but free from stain or defilement of any sort. The word used here (<span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> not common in the New Testament. The adverb occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-16.htm">Philippians 1:16</a>, where it is rendered "sincerely," and implies purity of motive. <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever things are lovely</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;</span>); not beautiful, but pleasing, lovable; whatsoever things would attract the love of holy souls. <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever things are of good report</span>. The word (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) means "well-speaking" (not "well spoken of"), and so "gracious," "attractive;" in classical Greek it means "auspicious," "of good omen." Of these six heads, the first two describe the subjects of devout thought as they are in themselves; the second pair relate to practical life; the third pair to the moral approbation which the contemplation of a holy life excites in good men. <span class="cmt_word">If there be any virtue</span>. This word, so very common in the Greek moralists, occurs nowhere else in St. Paul. Nor does any other of the New Testament writers use it except St. Peter (l Peter 2:9 (in the Greek); <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-3.htm">2 Peter 1:3, 5</a>). Bishop Lightfoot says, "The strangeness of the word, combined with the change of expression, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, will suggest another explanation: 'Whatever value may reside in your old heathen conception of virtue, whatever consideration is due to the praise of men; ' as if the apostle were anxious not to omit any possible ground of appeal." <span class="cmt_word">And if there be any praise</span>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-21.htm">2 Corinthians 8:21</a>, where St. Paul bids us "provide for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men." Nevertheless, in the highest point of view, the praise of the true Israelite is not of man, but of God. <span class="cmt_word">Think on these things</span>; or, as in the margin of R.V., <span class="accented">take account of.</span> Let these be the considerations which guide your thoughts and direct your motives. The apostle implies that we have the power of governing our thoughts, and so are responsible for them. If the thoughts are ordered well, the outward life will follow. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:2-9 Let believers be of one mind, and ready to help each other. As the apostle had found the benefit of their assistance, he knew how comfortable it would be to his fellow-labourers to have the help of others. Let us seek to give assurance that our names are written in the book of life. Joy in God is of great consequence in the Christian life; and Christians need to be again and again called to it. It more than outweighs all causes for sorrow. Let their enemies perceive how moderate they were as to outward things, and how composedly they suffered loss and hardships. The day of judgment will soon arrive, with full redemption to believers, and destruction to ungodly men. There is a care of diligence which is our duty, and agrees with a wise forecast and due concern; but there is a care of fear and distrust, which is sin and folly, and only perplexes and distracts the mind. As a remedy against perplexing care, constant prayer is recommended. Not only stated times for prayer, but in every thing by prayer. We must join thanksgivings with prayers and supplications; not only seek supplies of good, but own the mercies we have received. God needs not to be told our wants or desires; he knows them better than we do; but he will have us show that we value the mercy, and feel our dependence on him. The peace of God, the comfortable sense of being reconciled to God, and having a part in his favour, and the hope of the heavenly blessedness, are a greater good than can be fully expressed. This peace will keep our hearts and minds through Christ Jesus; it will keep us from sinning under troubles, and from sinking under them; keep us calm and with inward satisfaction. Believers are to get and to keep a good name; a name for good things with God and good men. We should walk in all the ways of virtue, and abide therein; then, whether our praise is of men or not, it will be of God. The apostle is for an example. His doctrine and life agreed together. The way to have the God of peace with us, is to keep close to our duty. All our privileges and salvation arise in the free mercy of God; yet the enjoyment of them depends on our sincere and holy conduct. These are works of God, pertaining to God, and to him only are they to be ascribed, and to no other, neither men, words, nor deeds.</body></html>
