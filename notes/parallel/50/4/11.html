There is evident reference to the habit peculiar to St. Paul, and made by him his especial "glory" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-14.htm" title="Even so has the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.">1Corinthians 9:14</a>), of refusing that maintenance from the churches which was his of right. Compare his words to the Ephesian presbyters, "I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/20-33.htm" title="I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.">Acts 20:33-34</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Content.</span>--The word (like the corresponding substantive in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-8.htm" title="And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:">2Corinthians 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-6.htm" title="But godliness with contentment is great gain.">1Timothy 6:6</a>) properly means, <span class= "ital">self-sufficing.</span> Such self-sufficiency was the especial characteristic claimed by the Stoics for the ideal wise man of their philosophy--a characteristic full of nobleness, so far as it involved the sitting loose to all the things of the world, but inhuman in relation to human affections, and virtually atheistic if it described the attitude of the soul towards the Supreme Power. Only in the first relation does St. Paul claim it here. It is difficult not to suppose that he does so with some reference to a philosophy so essentially Roman in practical development.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content</span>. . He explains himself; it is not want that prompted his words. Literally, I <span class="accented">learned</span> (the verb is aorist); that <span class="accented">is</span>, when he became a Christian. The A.V. is verbally inaccurate in the following words, which mean literally, "In the circumstances in which I am." But the sense is the same. St. Paul is speaking of his present condition: he is content with it, though it involves all the hardships of captivity; his present contentment is a sample of his habitual frame of mind. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> here rendered "<span class="accented">content</span>," is a common word in Greek philosophy. It means "self-sufficient," "<span class="accented">independent."</span> It is of frequent occurrence in Stoical treatises; but St. Paul uses it in a Christian sense; he is <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> in relation to man, but his <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> comes from God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-8.htm">2 Corinthians 9:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:10-19 It is a good work to succour and help a good minister in trouble. The nature of true Christian sympathy, is not only to feel concern for our friends in their troubles, but to do what we can to help them. The apostle was often in bonds, imprisonments, and necessities; but in all, he learned to be content, to bring his mind to his condition, and make the best of it. Pride, unbelief, vain hankering after something we have not got, and fickle disrelish of present things, make men discontented even under favourable circumstances. Let us pray for patient submission and hope when we are abased; for humility and a heavenly mind when exalted. It is a special grace to have an equal temper of mind always. And in a low state not to lose our comfort in God, nor distrust his providence, nor take any wrong course for our own supply. In a prosperous condition not to be proud, or secure, or worldly. This is a harder lesson than the other; for the temptations of fulness and prosperity are more than those of affliction and want. The apostle had no design to urge them to give more, but to encourage such kindness as will meet a glorious reward hereafter. Through Christ we have grace to do what is good, and through him we must expect the reward; and as we have all things by him, let us do all things for him, and to his glory.</body></html>
