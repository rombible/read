There is, says St. Paul, "the fruit" of reward, which "is over" as a surplus, or rather a balance, "placed to their account." Their gift is a token of love and gratitude to him; but, as Christian almsgiving, it is something more, and what that something more is will be seen hereafter, when all accounts shall be finally taken. The idea is not unlike that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-17.htm" title="He that has pity on the poor lends to the LORD; and that which he has given will he pay him again.">Proverbs 19:17</a>, "He that hath pity on the poor lendeth unto the Lord; and behold, what he layeth out it shall be paid him again."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account</span>; rather, as R.V., not <span class="accented">that</span> I <span class="accented">seek for the gift</span>; <span class="accented">but I seek for the fruit that creaseth to your account.</span> He shrinks sensitively from the danger of being mistaken; his words are not to be understood as a hint for further gifts. It is not the gift that he desires; but there is something which he longs for, and that is, charity, the fruit of the Spirit, showing itself in the generosity of the Philippians - the fruit of good works, continually increasing, and set down in heaven to their account. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:10-19 It is a good work to succour and help a good minister in trouble. The nature of true Christian sympathy, is not only to feel concern for our friends in their troubles, but to do what we can to help them. The apostle was often in bonds, imprisonments, and necessities; but in all, he learned to be content, to bring his mind to his condition, and make the best of it. Pride, unbelief, vain hankering after something we have not got, and fickle disrelish of present things, make men discontented even under favourable circumstances. Let us pray for patient submission and hope when we are abased; for humility and a heavenly mind when exalted. It is a special grace to have an equal temper of mind always. And in a low state not to lose our comfort in God, nor distrust his providence, nor take any wrong course for our own supply. In a prosperous condition not to be proud, or secure, or worldly. This is a harder lesson than the other; for the temptations of fulness and prosperity are more than those of affliction and want. The apostle had no design to urge them to give more, but to encourage such kindness as will meet a glorious reward hereafter. Through Christ we have grace to do what is good, and through him we must expect the reward; and as we have all things by him, let us do all things for him, and to his glory.</body></html>
