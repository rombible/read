The time referred to is his leaving Macedonia for Athens and Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-14.htm" title="And then immediately the brothers sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus stayed there still.">Acts 17:14</a>). At Corinth we know that he received offerings from Macedonia: "That which was lacking to me the brethren who came (<span class= "ital">when they came</span>) from Macedonia supplied" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-9.htm" title="And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brothers which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so will I keep myself.">2Corinthians 11:9</a>). His language to the Thessalonian Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail: for laboring night and day, because we would not be chargeable to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.">1Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm" title="Neither did we eat any man's bread for nothing; but worked with labor and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:">2Thessalonians 3:8</a>) precludes all idea that any part of this contribution was from Thessalonica; we learn here that it was from no other Church than Philippi. It is probably to this gift that reference is made; though it is of course possible that some contribution may have reached him at the time of his actual departure in haste after the persecution at Ber?a.<p><span class= "bld">Communicated with me as concerning . . .</span>--The metaphor here is drawn from commercial transaction. Literally the passage runs, <span class= "ital">had dealings with me on account of giving and receiving; "</span>opened (so to speak) an account with me," not of debit and credit, but "of free giving and receiving." There is possibly an allusion (as Chrysostom suggests) to the idea embodied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-11.htm" title="If we have sown to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?">1Corinthians 9:11</a>, "If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things?" (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-27.htm" title="It has pleased them truly; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in carnal things.">Romans 15:27</a>.) In the one respect he had all to give, and they to receive; in the other the relations were reversed. But if there be such allusion, it is kept in <span class= "ital">the</span> background. The prominent idea is of the Philippians, and of them alone, as givers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel when I departed from Macedonia</span>. He reminds them delicately of their former liberality to show his love for them; he was not unwilling to receive kindnesses from them. He had always refused to accept contributions from the Corinthians; but the bonds which bound him to the Macedonian Churches were closer and tenderer. <span class="accented">In the be</span>g<span class="accented">inning of the gospel</span>; when he first preached in Macedonia, ten years ago. The words, "when I departed from Macedonia," may refer either to some gifts not mentioned elsewhere, sent to him when be left Beroea for Athens; or, if the aorist be taken in a pluperfect sense, to the supplies afterwards sent to him at Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-8.htm">2 Corinthians 11:8, 9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">No Church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only</span>. Chrysostom understands this of giving worldly things and receiving spiritual things (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-11.htm">1 Corinthians 9:11</a>). But the context seems to restrict the meaning to temporal gifts: the Philippians gave, St. Paul received. Bengel says, "Poterant diccre, Faciemus, si alii fecerint: nunc eo major horum laus est: ceterorum, eo minor." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:10-19 It is a good work to succour and help a good minister in trouble. The nature of true Christian sympathy, is not only to feel concern for our friends in their troubles, but to do what we can to help them. The apostle was often in bonds, imprisonments, and necessities; but in all, he learned to be content, to bring his mind to his condition, and make the best of it. Pride, unbelief, vain hankering after something we have not got, and fickle disrelish of present things, make men discontented even under favourable circumstances. Let us pray for patient submission and hope when we are abased; for humility and a heavenly mind when exalted. It is a special grace to have an equal temper of mind always. And in a low state not to lose our comfort in God, nor distrust his providence, nor take any wrong course for our own supply. In a prosperous condition not to be proud, or secure, or worldly. This is a harder lesson than the other; for the temptations of fulness and prosperity are more than those of affliction and want. The apostle had no design to urge them to give more, but to encourage such kindness as will meet a glorious reward hereafter. Through Christ we have grace to do what is good, and through him we must expect the reward; and as we have all things by him, let us do all things for him, and to his glory.</body></html>
