But the universal extension of the maxim beyond the immediate occasion and context is not inadmissible. It represents the ultimate and ideal consciousness of the Christian. The first thing needful is to throw off mere self-sufficiency, to know our weakness and sin, and accept the salvation of God's free grace in Christ; the next, to find the "strength made perfect in weakness," and in that to be strong.<p><span class= "bld">Through Christ which strengtheneth me.</span>--The word "Christ" is not found in the best MSS.; it is a gloss, perhaps suggested by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-12.htm" title="And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;">1Timothy 1:12</a>, where we have exactly the same phrase, "Christ Jesus, our Lord, who hath enabled me." The same word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-10.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.">Ephesians 6:10</a>, "Be strong (<span class= "ital">strengthened within</span>) in the Lord." In this sentence we have the world-wide distinction between the Stoic and the Christian. Each teaches respect for the higher humanity in the soul; but to the one that humanity is our own, to the other it is "the Christ within," dwelling in the heart, regenerating and conforming it to Himself. The words of St. Paul are but a practical corollary to the higher truth (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-21.htm" title="For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.">Philippians 1:21</a>) "To me to live is Christ." In this consciousness alone is any thoughtful teaching of "self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-distrust," intelligible and coherent.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">in him that strengtheneth me.</span> The best manuscripts omit the word "Christ" in this place. <span class="accented">In him.</span> It is only in Christ, in spiritual union with him, that the Christian is <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, self-sufficient. His presence gives strength to do and suffer all things (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:10-19 It is a good work to succour and help a good minister in trouble. The nature of true Christian sympathy, is not only to feel concern for our friends in their troubles, but to do what we can to help them. The apostle was often in bonds, imprisonments, and necessities; but in all, he learned to be content, to bring his mind to his condition, and make the best of it. Pride, unbelief, vain hankering after something we have not got, and fickle disrelish of present things, make men discontented even under favourable circumstances. Let us pray for patient submission and hope when we are abased; for humility and a heavenly mind when exalted. It is a special grace to have an equal temper of mind always. And in a low state not to lose our comfort in God, nor distrust his providence, nor take any wrong course for our own supply. In a prosperous condition not to be proud, or secure, or worldly. This is a harder lesson than the other; for the temptations of fulness and prosperity are more than those of affliction and want. The apostle had no design to urge them to give more, but to encourage such kindness as will meet a glorious reward hereafter. Through Christ we have grace to do what is good, and through him we must expect the reward; and as we have all things by him, let us do all things for him, and to his glory.</body></html>
