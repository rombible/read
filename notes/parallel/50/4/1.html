For the faith, which is the root of good works, is not only "the evidence of things not seen," although already existing as spiritual realities, but also "the substantiation of things hoped for" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-1.htm" title="Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.">Hebrews 11:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Dearly beloved and longed for . . .</span>--The peculiar affectionateness of this verse is notable. It is curiously coincident with the words addressed years before to Thessalonica (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm" title="For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?">1Thessalonians 2:19</a>), "What is our hope and joy and crown of rejoicing? Are not ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ . . .? Ye are our glory and our joy." But it has just the addition natural to the yearnings of captivity: they are "longed for," and that (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-8.htm" title="For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.">Philippians 1:8</a>) "in the heart of Jesus Christ." The "crown" is here the garland, the sign of victory in the apostolic race and struggle of which he had spoken above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/3-12.htm" title="Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.">Philippians 3:12-14</a>). The crown of glory, of righteousness, and of life, is usually described as future (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-8.htm" title="From now on there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but to all them also that love his appearing.">2Timothy 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-12.htm" title="Blessed is the man that endures temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him.">James 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-4.htm" title="And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away.">1Peter 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-10.htm" title="Fear none of those things which you shall suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried; and you shall have tribulation ten days: be you faithful to death, and I will give you a crown of life.">Revelation 2:10</a>), and this is the case in the Thessalonian Epistle. Here, without excluding that completer sense, the reference is also to the present. The Philippians are St. Paul's crown, as the Corinthians are his "seal" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-2.htm" title="If I be not an apostle to others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of my apostleship are you in the Lord.">1Corinthians 9:2</a>)--at once the proof of His apostolic mission and the reward of his apostolic labour. In both aspects the present is the earnest of the future.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown.</span> The apostle here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>, urges the hope of a glorious resurrection as an incentive to steadfastness in the Christian life. He seems scarcely able to find words adequate to express his love for the Philippians; he heaps together epithets of affection, dwelling tenderly on the word "beloved." He tells them of his longing desire to see them, repeating the word used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-8.htm">Philippians 1:8</a>. He calls them his "joy and crown" - his joy now, his crown hereafter. He uses the same words of the other great Macedonian Church in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>, "What is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye?" The Greek word for "crown" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) means commonly either the wreath ("the corruptible crown," <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-25.htm">1 Corinthians 9:25</a>) which was the prize of victors at the Grecian games; or a garland worn at banquets and festivities. The royal crown is generally <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. But <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used in the Septuagint for a king's crown (see (in the Greek) <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-30.htm">2 Samuel 12:30</a>; Psalm 20:4 (A.V., Psalms 21:3); <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-15.htm">Esther 8:15</a>). The crown of thorns, too, which was used in mockery of the Savior's kingly title, was <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, though this may possibly have been suggested by the laurel wreath worn by the Roman Caesars (see Trench, 'Synonyms of the New Testament,' sect. 23.). "The crown of life," "the crown of glory that fadeth not away," is the emblem both of victory and of gladness. Yet it is also in some sense kingly: the saints shall sit with Christ in his throne; they shall reign with him; they are kings ("a kingdom," R.V., with the best manuscripts) and priests unto God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>). In this place victory seems to be the thought present to the apostle's mind. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a> and Philippians 2:12-14 he has been comparing the Christian life with the course of the Grecian athletes. Now he represents his converts as constituting his crown or wreath of victory at the last; their salvation is the crowning reward of his labors and sufferings<span class="cmt_word">. So stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved</span>. <span class="accented">So</span>; that is, as ye have us for an example; or perhaps, as becomes citizens of the heavenly commonwealth. The same word (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>, also in connection with the idea of citizenship. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1 The believing hope and prospect of eternal life, should make us steady and constant in our Christian course. There is difference of gifts and graces, yet, being renewed by the same Spirit, we are brethren. To stand fast in the Lord, is to stand fast in his strength, and by his grace.</body></html>
