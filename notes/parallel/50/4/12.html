A Stoic might well have used these words. There is even a touch of the Stoical contempt in the word "to be full," which properly applies to cattle, though frequently used of men in the New Testament. Perhaps, like all ascetics, they mostly knew how "to suffer need," better than how "to abound." But a Marcus Aurelius might have boldly claimed the knowledge of both.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound</span>. St. Paul had experience both of sorrow and of joy, both of distress and of comfort; he knew how to bear himself in both, because his chiefest joy was "in the Lord." This abiding joy raised him above the vicissitudes of this mortal state, and gave him an <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, a Christian independence, which enabled him to act becomingly both in adversity and in prosperity. <span class="cmt_word">Everywhere and in all things I am instructed</span>; literally, as R.V., <span class="accented">in everything and in all things</span>; as we say, "in each and all," in every condition separately and in all collectively. The R.V. translates more accurately, "have I learned the secret." The Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means properly, "I have been' initiated." It is a word adapted from the old Greek mysteries; comp. B.C.ngel, "Disciplina arcana imbutus sum, ignota mundo." St. Paul represents the advanced Christian life as a mystery, the secrets of which are taught by God. the Holy Ghost to the soul that longs to prove in its own personal experience "what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God." St. Paul frequently uses the word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, mystery, for the truths once hidden but now brought to light by the gospel. <span class="cmt_word">Both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</span> The word rendered "to be full" (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) is strictly used of animals, and means "to be foddered;" in the New Testament and later Greek it is used also of men, without any depreciatory significance, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-6.htm">Matthew 5:6</a>, "<span class="accented">They</span> shall be filled (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:10-19 It is a good work to succour and help a good minister in trouble. The nature of true Christian sympathy, is not only to feel concern for our friends in their troubles, but to do what we can to help them. The apostle was often in bonds, imprisonments, and necessities; but in all, he learned to be content, to bring his mind to his condition, and make the best of it. Pride, unbelief, vain hankering after something we have not got, and fickle disrelish of present things, make men discontented even under favourable circumstances. Let us pray for patient submission and hope when we are abased; for humility and a heavenly mind when exalted. It is a special grace to have an equal temper of mind always. And in a low state not to lose our comfort in God, nor distrust his providence, nor take any wrong course for our own supply. In a prosperous condition not to be proud, or secure, or worldly. This is a harder lesson than the other; for the temptations of fulness and prosperity are more than those of affliction and want. The apostle had no design to urge them to give more, but to encourage such kindness as will meet a glorious reward hereafter. Through Christ we have grace to do what is good, and through him we must expect the reward; and as we have all things by him, let us do all things for him, and to his glory.</body></html>
