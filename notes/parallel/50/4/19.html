Where the word relates to God in Himself, His "glory" is His true nature as manifested to His creatures; where it refers to man, "glory" is the perfection of man's nature in the communion with God in Heaven. Here the latter sense is obviously to be taken. The "supplying of every need out of the riches" of God's love can only have its consummation in the "glory" of the future. That it is "in Christ Jesus" is a matter of course; for He is to "change even our body of humiliation to be fashioned like unto the body of His glory" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-21.htm" title="Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.">Philippians 3:21</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But my God shall supply all your need</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">every need of yours, My God</span>; the pronoun is emphatic, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-3.htm">Philippians 1:3</a>. God will accept your offerings as made to him; you have supplied my need, he will supply every need of yours. <span class="cmt_word">According to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus</span>. Not <span class="accented">by</span>; it should be "in Christ Jesus." The reward is given to his saints through union with him: "Beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, they are changed into the same image kern glory to glory." <span class="accented">In glory</span>; that is, by setting them in glory - the glory of holiness now, the glory of eternal life hereafter. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:10-19 It is a good work to succour and help a good minister in trouble. The nature of true Christian sympathy, is not only to feel concern for our friends in their troubles, but to do what we can to help them. The apostle was often in bonds, imprisonments, and necessities; but in all, he learned to be content, to bring his mind to his condition, and make the best of it. Pride, unbelief, vain hankering after something we have not got, and fickle disrelish of present things, make men discontented even under favourable circumstances. Let us pray for patient submission and hope when we are abased; for humility and a heavenly mind when exalted. It is a special grace to have an equal temper of mind always. And in a low state not to lose our comfort in God, nor distrust his providence, nor take any wrong course for our own supply. In a prosperous condition not to be proud, or secure, or worldly. This is a harder lesson than the other; for the temptations of fulness and prosperity are more than those of affliction and want. The apostle had no design to urge them to give more, but to encourage such kindness as will meet a glorious reward hereafter. Through Christ we have grace to do what is good, and through him we must expect the reward; and as we have all things by him, let us do all things for him, and to his glory.</body></html>
