Every saint individually - an expression of personal affection. The words, "in Christ Jesus," may be taken with "salute," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-22.htm">Romans 16:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>. It is a Christian salutation, an acknowledgment of spiritual relationship; or better, perhaps, as in numerous passages, with "saint." All saints are in Christ, members of his body, knit together into one communion and fellowship in the mystical body of Christ. It is this union with Christ which makes them saints. <span class="cmt_word">The brethren which are with me greet you.</span> Observe, he calls them "brethren," though he had none like-minded with him, save only Timothy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-20.htm">Philippians 2:20, 21</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:20-23 The apostle ends with praises to God. We should look upon God, under all our weakness and fears, not as an enemy, but as a Father, disposed to pity us and help us. We must give glory to God as a Father. God's grace and favour, which reconciled souls enjoy, with the whole of the graces in us, which flow from it, are all purchased for us by Christ's merit, and applied by his pleading for us; and therefore are justly called the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.</body></html>
