Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?">Matthew 6:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-34.htm" title="Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof.">Matthew 6:34</a>). The prohibition is of that painful anxiety which is inevitable in all who feel themselves alone in mere self-dependence amidst the difficulties and dangers of life. It is possible to sink below this anxiety in mere levity and thoughtlessness; it is possible to rise above it by "casting our care on Him who careth for us," and knowing that we are simply "fellow-workers with Him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-7.htm" title="Casting all your care on him; for he cares for you.">1Peter 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-1.htm" title="We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that you receive not the grace of God in vain.">2Corinthians 6:1</a>). Hence the Apostle passes on at once to speak of the trustfulness of prayer.<p><span class= "bld">Prayer and supplication with thanksgiving.</span>--By "prayer" is meant worship generally, so called (as in common parlance now) because in this state of imperfection prayer must be its leading element, as praise will be in the perfection of the future. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-42.htm" title="And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.">Acts 2:42</a>, where "the prayers" are among the essential marks of church membership.) To this general word is subjoined the distinction of the two great elements of worship, "supplication with thanksgiving." The very expression, however, shows that, though distinct, they are inseparable. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-18.htm" title="Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;">Ephesians 6:18</a>, and Note there.) Both words "prayer" and "supplication" have the article in the original, and may probably refer to the recognised worship of the Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be careful for nothing</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">in nothing be anxious.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> is anxious, distracting care. St. Paul does not wish his converts to be careless, but to be free from that over-anxiety about worldly things which might distract their thoughts from the service of God, and hinder their growth in holiness. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>, where the apostle bids us cast all our care (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) upon God. The thought of the Lord's nearness should lead us both to be forbearing in our relations to others, and also to keep ourselves free, as far as may be, from worldly anxieties. "He careth for us." <span class="cmt_word">But in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God</span>. "Curare et orare," says Bengel, "plus inter se pugnant quam aqua et ignis." <span class="accented">In everything</span>; in each emergency, little or great, as it arises, pray; cultivate the habit of referring all things, great or small, to God in prayer. The two words rendered "prayer" and "supplication" <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) occur together also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-18.htm">Ephesians 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2.htm">1 Timothy 2</a>:l and Ephesians 5:5. The first has been defined by Chrysostom and others as prayer to obtain a good; the second, prayer to avoid an evil Better, perhaps, as most modern commentators, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> is the general word, covering the idea of prayer in its widest meaning; while <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is a special act of supplication for some particular object of need (see Trench, 'Synonyms of the New Testament,' sect. 51.). <span class="accented">With thanksgiving.</span> Thanksgiving is the necessary accompaniment of prayer; it ought never to be absent from our devotions; it springs out of that holy joy which St. Paul so constantly sets before us in this Epistle as the bounden duty of Christians. St. Paul himself is an example of constant thanksgiving. All his Epistles, except those to the Galatians, 1 Timothy, and Titus, open with a thanksgiving. In the dungeon at Philippi he and Silas "prayed and sang praises unto God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25</a>). Our requests, the things for which we ask, are to be made known unto God; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> before God, in the presence of God, by prayer, the general converse of the soul with God; and by supplication, direct petitions for the supply of our necessities. Indeed, he knows our necessities before we ask; but we are encouraged to make them known before him, as Hezekiah took the letter of Sennacherib and spread it before the Lord. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:2-9 Let believers be of one mind, and ready to help each other. As the apostle had found the benefit of their assistance, he knew how comfortable it would be to his fellow-labourers to have the help of others. Let us seek to give assurance that our names are written in the book of life. Joy in God is of great consequence in the Christian life; and Christians need to be again and again called to it. It more than outweighs all causes for sorrow. Let their enemies perceive how moderate they were as to outward things, and how composedly they suffered loss and hardships. The day of judgment will soon arrive, with full redemption to believers, and destruction to ungodly men. There is a care of diligence which is our duty, and agrees with a wise forecast and due concern; but there is a care of fear and distrust, which is sin and folly, and only perplexes and distracts the mind. As a remedy against perplexing care, constant prayer is recommended. Not only stated times for prayer, but in every thing by prayer. We must join thanksgivings with prayers and supplications; not only seek supplies of good, but own the mercies we have received. God needs not to be told our wants or desires; he knows them better than we do; but he will have us show that we value the mercy, and feel our dependence on him. The peace of God, the comfortable sense of being reconciled to God, and having a part in his favour, and the hope of the heavenly blessedness, are a greater good than can be fully expressed. This peace will keep our hearts and minds through Christ Jesus; it will keep us from sinning under troubles, and from sinking under them; keep us calm and with inward satisfaction. Believers are to get and to keep a good name; a name for good things with God and good men. We should walk in all the ways of virtue, and abide therein; then, whether our praise is of men or not, it will be of God. The apostle is for an example. His doctrine and life agreed together. The way to have the God of peace with us, is to keep close to our duty. All our privileges and salvation arise in the free mercy of God; yet the enjoyment of them depends on our sincere and holy conduct. These are works of God, pertaining to God, and to him only are they to be ascribed, and to no other, neither men, words, nor deeds.</body></html>
