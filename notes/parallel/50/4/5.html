Such distinction the world recognises when it speaks of what is enjoined, not so much by duty as by "good taste, or "right feeling," or (with some peculiarity of application) by "chivalrous" feeling, or the "spirit of a gentleman." Here it denotes the general sense of what is seemly in a Christian tone of character. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-1.htm" title="Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:">2Corinthians 10:1</a> (where it is translated "gentleness") it is ascribed emphatically to our Lord Himself. But <span class= "ital">the</span> usage of the New Testament appropriates it especially to the "sweet reasonableness" which "gentleness" may well designate. Thus, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-4.htm" title="Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious to you, I pray you that you would hear us of your clemency a few words.">Acts 24:4</a> it clearly signifies patience, or forbearance; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-1.htm" title="Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:">2Corinthians 10:1</a> it is associated with meekness; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-3.htm" title="Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;">1Timothy 3:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-2.htm" title="To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, showing all meekness to all men.">Titus 3:2</a>, with peaceableness; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-8.htm" title="And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.">1Peter 2:8</a>, with kindness; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-17.htm" title="But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.">James 3:17</a> the word "gentle" is placed between "peaceable" and "easy to be entreated" (or rather, <span class= "ital">persuaded</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> This spirit is, no doubt, "moderation;" but it is something more. It may refer here both to the exhortation to unity in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/4-1.htm" title="Therefore, my brothers dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.">Philippians 4:1-3</a>, and to the exhortation to joy immediately preceding. It would help the one and chasten the other.<p><span class= "bld">The Lord is at hand.</span>--A translation of the Syriac "Maran-atha" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-22.htm" title="If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.">1Corinthians 16:22</a>--obviously a Christian watchword, probably referring to the Second Advent as near at hand; although, of course, not excluding the larger idea of that presence of Christ in His Church of which that Second Advent is the consummation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let your moderation be known unto all men</span>; rather, <span class="accented">forbearance</span>, or <span class="accented">gentleness.</span> The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (here the neuter adjective is used) is translated "gentleness" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-1.htm">2 Corinthians 10:1</a>, where it is attributed to our Lord himself. In the Aristotelian' Ethics' it stands for the temper which contents itself with less than its due, and shrinks from insisting on its strict rights. There is no joy in a narrow selfishness; joy involves an open heart, a generous love. Joy in the Lord tends to make men gentle and mild to others. "Gaudium in Domino," says Bengel, "parit veram aequitatem erga proximum." <span class="accented">Unto all men</span>; heathen as well as Christian. Compare our Lord's word: "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another." St. Paul would have the heathen <span class="accented">say</span>, "See how these Christians love one another." Their mutual love would be the blessed means of drawing fresh converts to the faith. There may possibly be an allusion here to the differences between Euodia and Syntyche; let there be no more disagreements, but rather mutual forbearance. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is at hand</span>. The Aramaic <span class="accented">Maranatha</span> ("the Lord cometh") in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-22.htm">1 Corinthians 16:22</a> seems to imply that these words were current in the Church as a formula of warning, like "Hallelujah" as a set form of praise. The Lord is at hand therefore be not careful to exact your full rights; love is more precious than gold in the treasury of heaven. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-8.htm">James 5:8</a>, "Be ye also patient,... for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh." Others interpret the words, not of the future advent, but of the Lord's present nearness. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-18.htm">Psalm 145:18</a>, "The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him." But this seems scarcely so appropriate here. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:2-9 Let believers be of one mind, and ready to help each other. As the apostle had found the benefit of their assistance, he knew how comfortable it would be to his fellow-labourers to have the help of others. Let us seek to give assurance that our names are written in the book of life. Joy in God is of great consequence in the Christian life; and Christians need to be again and again called to it. It more than outweighs all causes for sorrow. Let their enemies perceive how moderate they were as to outward things, and how composedly they suffered loss and hardships. The day of judgment will soon arrive, with full redemption to believers, and destruction to ungodly men. There is a care of diligence which is our duty, and agrees with a wise forecast and due concern; but there is a care of fear and distrust, which is sin and folly, and only perplexes and distracts the mind. As a remedy against perplexing care, constant prayer is recommended. Not only stated times for prayer, but in every thing by prayer. We must join thanksgivings with prayers and supplications; not only seek supplies of good, but own the mercies we have received. God needs not to be told our wants or desires; he knows them better than we do; but he will have us show that we value the mercy, and feel our dependence on him. The peace of God, the comfortable sense of being reconciled to God, and having a part in his favour, and the hope of the heavenly blessedness, are a greater good than can be fully expressed. This peace will keep our hearts and minds through Christ Jesus; it will keep us from sinning under troubles, and from sinking under them; keep us calm and with inward satisfaction. Believers are to get and to keep a good name; a name for good things with God and good men. We should walk in all the ways of virtue, and abide therein; then, whether our praise is of men or not, it will be of God. The apostle is for an example. His doctrine and life agreed together. The way to have the God of peace with us, is to keep close to our duty. All our privileges and salvation arise in the free mercy of God; yet the enjoyment of them depends on our sincere and holy conduct. These are works of God, pertaining to God, and to him only are they to be ascribed, and to no other, neither men, words, nor deeds.</body></html>
