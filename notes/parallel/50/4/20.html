"Glory" may be derivatively the privilege of man; but "<span class= "ital">the</span> glory" (for the original has the article here)--the essential and incommunicable glory--must be ascribed to God alone. Whether we supply here the word "is" or "be" matters not. His it is; to Him let it be ascribed. Such doxologies are common with St. Paul (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-27.htm" title="To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.">Romans 16:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-5.htm" title="To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.">Galatians 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-21.htm" title="To him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.">Ephesians 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-17.htm" title="Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.">1Timothy 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-18.htm" title="And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me to his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.">2Timothy 4:18</a>); always with the addition of "for ever and ever," or literally, <span class= "ital">for the ages of the ages, </span>throughout every age till time shall be no more; always in close connection with some declaration, not so much of the majesty, as of the wisdom, and still more the goodness, of the Father.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/4-21.htm" title="Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers which are with me greet you.">Philippians 4:21-23</a> contain the salutation and blessing. The salutation is very brief, as compared, for example, with the corresponding passage in the Colossian Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/4-10.htm" title="But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again; wherein you were also careful, but you lacked opportunity.">Philippians 4:10-15</a>), naming none, either of those saluted or those joining with St. Paul in the salutation. The omission in the latter case may perhaps be accounted for by the words above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-20.htm" title="For I have no man like minded, who will naturally care for your state.">Philippians 2:20-21</a>), in which, with the single exception of Timotheus, St. Paul declares dissatisfaction with those near him, because "all seek their own, and not the things which are Jesus Christ's.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Amen</span>; rather, with R.V., <span class="accented">unto our God and Father be the glory.</span> The thought of God's present mercies, and the hope of glory to come mentioned in the last verse, suggest the doxology. Observe, St. Paul <span class="accented">says</span>, "our God and Father" here. He said, "my God" in ver. 19, where he was speaking of the reward which God would give for kindness shown to himself; but now "our God," as the one Object of praise and worship from the universal Church. <span class="accented">The</span> glory; the article is commonly used with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> in these doxologies - the glory which is God's peculiar possession, which is essentially his (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>). Bishop Lightfoot says, in his note on Galatians 1:5, "It is probable that we should supply <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;</span> in such cases rather than <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>. It is an affirmation rather than a wish. Glory is the essential attribute of God. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a9;&#x1fbe;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and the doxology added to the Lord's Prayer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>)." <span class="accented">For ever and ever</span>; literally, <span class="accented">for the ages of ages</span>; for the ages which consist, not of years, but of ages, for the countless ages of eternity (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-5.htm">Galatians 1:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-17.htm">1 Timothy 1:17</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:20-23 The apostle ends with praises to God. We should look upon God, under all our weakness and fears, not as an enemy, but as a Father, disposed to pity us and help us. We must give glory to God as a Father. God's grace and favour, which reconciled souls enjoy, with the whole of the graces in us, which flow from it, are all purchased for us by Christ's merit, and applied by his pleading for us; and therefore are justly called the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.</body></html>
