Hence it has been conjectured that the second <span class= "ital">Mene</span> was originally <span class= "ital">Madai,</span> or Media. This, though it appears plausible, has no external support. The word <span class= "ital">Mene,</span> "numbered," is repeated twice for the sake of emphasis. The days of Babylon are numbered; it is God Himself who has numbered them. "Mene" is used in the double sense of "numbering" and "bringing to an end." Similarly, "Tekel" implies both the act of "weighing" and the fact of "being light." The "<span class= "ital">u"</span> in <span class= "ital">Upharsin</span> is the conjunction "and," while <span class= "ital">pharsin,</span> or, rather, <span class= "ital">parsin,</span> is the plural of <span class= "ital">peres,</span> a noun which implies "divisions" and also Persians. It appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-28.htm" title="PERES; Your kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.">Daniel 5:28</a> that the divided empire of Babylon and the Medo-Persian empire are signified.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN. This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it. TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians</span>. The Septuagint has two versions of this passage, one m the text, the other in the portion at the beginning, which we think is really composed of marginal readings. In the text the Aramaic is not given at all. As we have already seen, the verse which corresponds to ver. 25 here is really the latter part of ver. 17 of the Septuagint, "This is the writing: It hath been numbered; it is reckoned; it has been carried away." In the verses which are appended to the beginning of the chapter, we have the Aramaic words, but given in a different order, and without the repetition of the first word: "MANE, PHARES, THEKEL. MANE, It has been numbered; PHARES, It is carried away; TnEKEL, It has been set up." Here not only is the order different, but the meaning assigned to <span class="accented">phares</span> is singular. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;</span> means in Syriac, "spread out." It would seem that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span> meant "stretched out" as well as "carried away." It is still more difficult to understand how <span class="accented">thekel </span>can mean "set up," unless the words, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1ff7;</span>, "on the balance," are understood. The Septuagint of the best version is briefer than the Massoretic, though less so than it is in some of the other passages, "Numbered is the time of thy kingdom; ceases thy kingdom; cut short and ended has been thy kingdom; to the Modes and the Persians has it been given." The word interpreted is not repeated as in the Massoretic text, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span> is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, which in some of the conjugations means "destroyed," whereas in ver. 17 it is rendered <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, "it is reckoned," a rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e7;&#x5dc;</span> which makes it mean "weigh." The Septuagint rendering of the first clause is an evident attempt at explaining the numbering implied. The Massoretic reading involves a pun in both the last words; there is a play between <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">teqel</span>), "to weigh," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">qelal</span>), "to be light," although the introduction of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5db;&#x5d7;</span> rather conceals this. In the last the play is between <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e8;&#x5e1;</span>, "to divide," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5d3;&#x5e1;</span>, "a Persian." Theodotion avoids the repetition of the first word, otherwise he is in somewhat close agreement with the Massoretic text, "MANE, God hath measured thy kingdom; THEKEL, It is set on the balance, and found wanting; PHARES, Thy kingdom is cut asunder, and given to the Medes and the Persians." The Peshitta is in close agreement with the Massoretic text. The actual meaning of the words, taking them as they appear in the Massoretictext, as Aramaic words, is, to give English equivalents, "a pound, a pound, an ounce, and quarters;" hence the impossibility of interpreting the words. We find all these words, <span class="accented">mena</span>, <span class="accented">teqel</span> (shekel), <span class="accented">pares</span>, in the Ninevite inscriptions. As the words are interpreted, we cannot fail to be impressed with the peremptory style of the inscription, as Hitzig has it. Zockler refers to the sculpturesque style (<span class="accented">lapidarstil</span>). This brevity rendered it difficult for the soothsayers to put any meaning into the words at all. In all the versions the fact that the kingdom is to be given to the Medes and Persians <span class="cmt_word">is</span> emphasized, but, moreover, the play on words in the last clause implies the Persians as the prominent assailants of the Babylonian power, but really that the two powers were united. It seems extraordinary that any one, in the face of this, should maintain that the author of Daniel separated the two powers, and thought the Median power succeeded the Babylonian, and then that the Persian succeeded the Median. We know now that Herodotus's representation of the history of Media and Persia is utterly false and misleading. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:18-31 Daniel reads Belshazzar's doom. He had not taken warning by the judgments upon Nebuchadnezzar. And he had insulted God. Sinners are pleased with gods that neither see, nor hear, nor know; but they will be judged by One to whom all things are open. Daniel reads the sentence written on the wall. All this may well be applied to the doom of every sinner. At death, the sinner's days are numbered and finished; after death is the judgment, when he will be weighed in the balance, and found wanting; and after judgment the sinner will be cut asunder, and given as a prey to the devil and his angels. While these things were passing in the palace, it is considered that the army of Cyrus entered the city; and when Belshazzar was slain, a general submission followed. Soon will every impenitent sinner find the writing of God's word brought to pass upon him, whether he is weighed in the balance of the law as a self-righteous Pharisee, or in that of the gospel as a painted hypocrite.</body></html>
