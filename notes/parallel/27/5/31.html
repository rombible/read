(See <span class= "ital">Excursus D.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">Took</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> received it from the hands of a conqueror. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-1.htm" title="In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;">Daniel 9:1</a>, where Darius is said to have been "made king over the realm of the Chaldeans.")<p><span class= "bld">EXCURSUS D: DARIUS THE MEDE (Daniel 5:31).</span><p>It appears from the account given by Daniel that Darius the Mede was the sovereign appointed to rule over Babylonia after the death of Belshazzar. Cyrus, after the capture of Babylon, appointed a man named Gubaru (Gobryas) as his governor at Babylon. Can he and Darius the Mede be the same person? It is impossible to identify Darius with any personage mentioned in profane history, and hitherto no traces of any such name have been found in Babylonian inscriptions belonging to this period. Till time or circumstances shall give further information, we must maintain that a book like Daniel's, which is correct on many minor points, cannot fail to be accurate upon the subject of Darius.<p>Difficulties were experienced at a very early time in reference to this subject. The LXX., assuming that Ahasuerus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-1.htm" title="In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;">Daniel 9:1</a>) was Xerxes, identified him with Artaxerxes. The opinion of Josephus is that Darius (<span class= "ital">Antt.</span> x. 11, ? 4) and his kinsman Cyrus destroyed the supremacy of Babylon; and at the fall of the capital, this Darius, son of Astyages, took Daniel with him to Media, and placed him in an exalted situation. St. Jerome agrees to this relationship between Cyrus and Darius. St. Ephraim is silent; but Theodoret goes further, and identifies Darius with Cyaxares, son of Astyages. In modern times the identity of Darius with Cyaxares II. has been strongly maintained, though without paying sufficient attention to the very slight evidence in favour of the existence of the latter. The identification of Darius with Astyages has an obvious refutation, for in B.C. 536 Astyages would have exceeded the age ascribed to Darius by Daniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-31.htm" title="And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about three score and two years old.">Daniel 5:31</a>).<p>It is evident from history that Cyrus was the immediate conqueror of Babylon, and that no Median Empire came between the Babylonian and the Persian Empires. It is also clear that Daniel regards Darius as one who "received the kingdom" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-31.htm" title="And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about three score and two years old.">Daniel 5:31</a>), and who "was made king" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-1.htm" title="In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;">Daniel 9:1</a>). If the word Darius means "a maintainor," all that is mentioned in this chapter amounts to no more than the statement that a Median governor took the kingdom." How. ever, the use of the word (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-1.htm" title="In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;">Daniel 9:1</a>) requires the name of a person rather than an office.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about three score and two years old</span>. It is probable that the Massoretic division of the chapters here is to be preferred. According to it, this verse is assigned to the begining of the next chapter, but most of the more ancient versions, Theodotion, the Peshitta, and the Vulgate, agree with our English arrangement. The Septuagint, like the Massoretic text, assigns this verse to the sixth chapter. Its rendering manifests several striking peculiarities, "And Artaxerxes of the Medes received (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;</span>) <span class="accented">the</span> kingdom, and Darius was full of days, and reverend (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) in old age." This is the product of doublets <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;</span>, Artaxerxes, being suggested by some scribe as in his opinion a more probable name than Darius. So the one name begins the first clause, and the other the second. The last clause is evidently due to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">kebar</span>), "about" ("as the son of"), being read <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">kaber</span>), "great," "multiplied" - a meaning this word has in Syriac, but not in Chahlee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>). Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. The uncertainty as to the name has to be noted. We shall reserve for fuller discussion the question of Darius the Mede, only we would say that the name not improbably was modified from a less-known name to one somewhat like it but well known. We know that "<span class="accented">Go-baru</span>," or "<span class="accented">Oybaru"</span> <span class="accented">-</span> "Gobryas," in Greek - was appointed governor by Cyrus when he conquered Babylon, and that, in the script of the Sindschirli monuments, <span class="accented">Gobryas</span>, or . is not unlike <span class="accented">Darius</span>. One point to be noted is the fact that the verb used is wrongly translated "took." really means "received." When this is said, we naturally expect some one, either God or man, from whom he has received this honour. If this purported to be a history of Babylonia, then it might be reasoned that the implied source from whom the kingdom was received was God; in such a case <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span> would be used of one who succeeded to the kingdom by inheritance; this cannot be the meaning here. In this passage it is merely incidentally mentioned in order to explain the events that immediately follow. The more natural interpretation is that he was put on the throne by another person, his superior. The instance quoted by Professor Bevan, in which this verb is used of the accession of Julian the Apostate, tells really against his contention. Julian expected to have to conquer the empire: but, by the death of his cousin, he received it as an inheritance. Nothing could be more unlike what occurred in Babylon, according to his theory of what the author of Daniel meant. He maintains that the author of Daniel thought Darius conquered Babylon, and so ascended the throne. The example he brings does not show that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span> could be used in that sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:18-31 Daniel reads Belshazzar's doom. He had not taken warning by the judgments upon Nebuchadnezzar. And he had insulted God. Sinners are pleased with gods that neither see, nor hear, nor know; but they will be judged by One to whom all things are open. Daniel reads the sentence written on the wall. All this may well be applied to the doom of every sinner. At death, the sinner's days are numbered and finished; after death is the judgment, when he will be weighed in the balance, and found wanting; and after judgment the sinner will be cut asunder, and given as a prey to the devil and his angels. While these things were passing in the palace, it is considered that the army of Cyrus entered the city; and when Belshazzar was slain, a general submission followed. Soon will every impenitent sinner find the writing of God's word brought to pass upon him, whether he is weighed in the balance of the law as a self-righteous Pharisee, or in that of the gospel as a painted hypocrite.</body></html>
