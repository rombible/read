The Greek versions here differ considerably from the Massoretic text. The LXX. is as follows: "And out of one there sprang a strong horn, and it prevailed and smote toward the south, toward the south-west (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), and toward the east, and toward the north." In this case, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is clearly a doublet - an alternative rendering that has got into the text from the margin. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span> results from reading <span class="accented">tzephonah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) instead of <span class="accented">tzebee</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>). Theodotion renders, "From one of them went forth a strong horn, and was magnified exceedingly to the south and to the power" - reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">tzaba</span>), "host," for <span class="accented">tzebee.</span> It is to be observed that both translate <span class="accented">mitztze'eeroth</span> as "strong" (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) instead of "little." The reason of this is that they have taken <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;</span> as equivalent to <span class="accented">ex</span>, therefore equivalent to a negative. The Peshitta agrees with the Authorized in reading <span class="accented">mitztzeeroth as</span> "little," but leaves out the difficult final word rendered "the pleasant land" in our Authorized Version. Jerome translates <span class="accented">mitztze'eeroth</span> by <span class="accented">modicum</span>, and <span class="accented">tzebee</span> by <span class="accented">fortitudinem</span> - a combination of Theodotion and the Massoretic; he must have had <span class="accented">tzaba</span> in his text instead of <span class="accented">tzebee</span>, - this may have been due to the fact that <span class="accented">tzaba</span> occurs in the next verse. The reference is sufficiently obvious to Antiochus. The description is accurate; he sprang from one of the four horns or dynasties that succeeded the great conqueror. He carried his arms to the east, but mainly to the south against Egypt. The great difficulties are in the two Hebrew words <span class="accented">mitztz"</span><span class="accented">eeroth</span> and <span class="accented">tzebee.</span> As to the first word, the fact that the two Greek versions have read it are conclusive against the suggestion of Gratz and Hitzig, supported by Bevan, that we should omit <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>. (<span class="accented">min</span>). Jephet-ibn-Ali takes <span class="accented">min</span> as denoting the origin of the horn, "from a little one." The further suggestion of Gratz, that we should adopt the reading of the LXX., is rightly combatted by Professor Bevan. The readings alike of the LXX. and Theodotion could have sprung from the Massoretic reading, whereas neither of these could so readily be the original reading. It was necessary that Israel should be prominent in this part of the prophecy; it all leads up to the persecution the Jews endured at the hands of Epiphanes. It is necessary, then, to hold that this word, whatever reading we adopt, and whatever immediate meaning we assign to it, must refer to Palestine. Ewald renders it "ornament;" Bevan, "glory." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-14 God gives Daniel a foresight of the destruction of other kingdoms, which in their day were as powerful as that of Babylon. Could we foresee the changes that shall be when we are gone, we should be less affected with changes in our own day. The ram with two horns was the second empire, that of Media and Persia. He saw this ram overcome by a he-goat. This was Alexander the Great. Alexander, when about thirty-three years of age, and in his full strength, died, and showed the vanity of worldly pomp and power, and that they cannot make a man happy. While men dispute, as in the case of Alexander, respecting the death of some prosperous warrior, it is plain that the great First Cause of all had no more of his plan for him to execute, and therefore cut him off. Instead of that one great horn, there came up four notable ones, Alexander's four chief captains. A little horn became a great persecutor of the church and people of God. It seems that the Mohammedan delusion is here pointed out. It prospered, and at one time nearly destroyed the holy religion God's right hand had planted. It is just with God to deprive those of the privileges of his house who despise and profane them; and to make those know the worth of ordinances by the want of them, who would not know it by the enjoyment of them. Daniel heard the time of this calamity limited and determined; but not the time when it should come. If we would know the mind of God, we must apply to Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; not hid from us, but hid for us. There is much difficulty as to the precise time here stated, but the end of it cannot be very distant. God will, for his own glory, see to the cleansing of the church in due time. Christ died to cleanse his church; and he will so cleanse it as to present it blameless to himself.</body></html>
