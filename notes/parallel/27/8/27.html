Theodotion evidently has lind the Massoretic text before him; but he has not understood, and has slavishly rendered it word for word.

At that time there seems to have been somewhat of a <span class="accented">rapprochement</span> between Nabu-nahid and Cyrus; but at the time before us, Cyrus must have begun to realize his destiny, and possibly would not be easy to on. at with. Daniel may have been plenipotentiary of Babylon at the court of Cyrus, endeavouring to secure a treaty. At the same time, aware that Croesus, the rival of Cyrus, might be called in, he continues the negotiation. <span class="accented">I was astonished at the vision</span>, <span class="accented">but none understood it.</span> The idea of the word translated "astonished" is "benumbed;" it may be exegetic of the first clause, explaining the cause of the fainting and subsequent sickness. It is clear that Daniel did not regard the command "to guard <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">satham</span>) the vision" as implying that he should keep it secret. We see, as we said above, that his complaint is that no one understood the vision. Behrmann maintains that <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">maybeen</span>), "to understand," ought to be translated "marked," "observed," but <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> would be the natural verb to use in such a connection, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>. Hitzig explains this by saying, "He had imparted the vision to no one." If Daniel had indulged in statements of float kind, the word before us would not have inaugurated a new form of literature. Professor Bevan's interpretation is as farfetched, "And I was no understander thereof." The example he brings forward of ver. 5 is not to the purpose, because the distinction between the first person and the third is too great. Moses Stuart has the same view. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:15-27 The eternal Son of God stood before the prophet in the appearance of a man, and directed the angel Gabriel to explain the vision. Daniel's fainting and astonishment at the prospect of evils he saw coming on his people and the church, confirm the opinion that long-continued calamities were foretold. The vision being ended, a charge was given to Daniel to keep it private for the present. He kept it to himself, and went on to do the duty of his place. As long as we live in this world we must have something to do in it; and even those whom God has most honoured, must not think themselves above their business. Nor must the pleasure of communion with God take us from the duties of our callings, but we must in them abide with God. All who are intrusted with public business must discharge their trust uprightly; and, amidst all doubts and discouragements, they may, if true believers, look forward to a happy issue. Thus should we endeavour to compose our minds for attending to the duties to which each is appointed, in the church and in the world.</body></html>
