St. Jerome observes that what happened in the times of Antiochus was typical of what shall be fulfilled hereafter in Antichrist.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision</span>. The versions <span class="cmt_word">are here</span> in close agreement with the Massoretic text<span class="cmt_word">.</span> On Gabriel's approach Daniel fell on his face, overwhelmed at contact with the spiritual. It is mentioned as if this were the natural result of such an interview as that vouchsafed to Daniel. At first sight this contradicts <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-16.htm">Daniel 7:16</a>, where Daniel interrogates one of the angelic bystanders. In the first place, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-15.htm">Daniel 7:15</a> <span class="accented">shows</span> that Daniel had been grieved and disturbed before he ventured on the question; and, next, Gabriel was one of the great angels that stood before God. Gabriel addressed Daniel by the title so often given to Ezekiel, "son of man," <span class="accented">ben-adam.</span> Professor Fuller, and also Kranichfeld, remark on the contrast between <span class="accented">Gabriel</span>, "<span class="accented">Hero</span> of <span class="accented">God</span>," and <span class="accented">ben-adam</span>, "<span class="accented">son</span> of <span class="accented">man"</span> <span class="accented">The time of the end</span> does not mean the end of the world, or of the appearance of the Messiah, for in this vision there is no reference to either of these. It is rather to be rendered, after the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-26.htm">Jeremiah 50:26</a>, where <span class="accented">miqqetz</span> means "from the utmost border," and reaches to a far-off time. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:15-27 The eternal Son of God stood before the prophet in the appearance of a man, and directed the angel Gabriel to explain the vision. Daniel's fainting and astonishment at the prospect of evils he saw coming on his people and the church, confirm the opinion that long-continued calamities were foretold. The vision being ended, a charge was given to Daniel to keep it private for the present. He kept it to himself, and went on to do the duty of his place. As long as we live in this world we must have something to do in it; and even those whom God has most honoured, must not think themselves above their business. Nor must the pleasure of communion with God take us from the duties of our callings, but we must in them abide with God. All who are intrusted with public business must discharge their trust uprightly; and, amidst all doubts and discouragements, they may, if true believers, look forward to a happy issue. Thus should we endeavour to compose our minds for attending to the duties to which each is appointed, in the church and in the world.</body></html>
