These apostates were given into his hand, and on account of their apostasy the daily sacrifice also was taken away. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-13.htm" title="Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said to that certain saint which spoke, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?">Daniel 8:13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The truth</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the word of God, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-43.htm" title="Yea, many also of the Israelites consented to his religion, and sacrificed unto idols, and profaned the sabbath.">1 Maccabees 1:43-52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-56.htm" title="And when they had rent in pieces the books of the law which they found, they burnt them with fire.">1 Maccabees 1:56</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-60.htm" title="At which time according to the commandment they put to death certain women, that had caused their children to be circumcised.">1 Maccabees 1:60</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and</span> <span class="cmt_word">prospered.</span> The renderings of the LXX. and Theodotion are closely related, and both differ from the Massoretic text. The first is, "And the sins were upon the sacrifice, and righteousness was fallen to the earth, and he (or, it) did, and prospered." Theodotion renders, "And sin was placed (given) upon the sacrifice, and righteousness is fallen to the earth, and he (it) did and prospered." The Peshitta is nearer the Massoretic text, but better in accordance with the Authorized Version, "A host was given against the perpetuity, in transgression the holy place was thrown to the ground, and he did and prospered." From the fact that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">tzaba</span>) is omitted from the two Greek versions, we venture to omit it also; it has probably been inserted from the verse above. Both versions also omit the preposition before" transgression;" we omit it also. We would thus render, "And transgression was upon the sacrifice, and," reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>, "truth was cast to the ground, and it did and prospered." After Judas Maccabaeus had cleansed the temple and offered sacrifices, sin mingled with it. We know that the stricter <span class="accented">Hasidim</span>, objected to the foreign alliances into which the Maccabees were inclined to enter; the battle of Beth-zecharias was largely lost by the abstention of the stricter party. After that, Lysias, representing really the same movement as Epiphanes, advanced to the capture of Bethshur. Thus it might be said of the little horn, that "it did and prospered." Were it not that there is no authority for it in the versions, we should read <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>. In that ease we should render, "And transgression was upon the sacrifice" - regarding this sacrifice as the atonement for the transgression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-21.htm">Leviticus 16:21</a>) - "and truth shall make peace in the land, and do and prosper." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-14 God gives Daniel a foresight of the destruction of other kingdoms, which in their day were as powerful as that of Babylon. Could we foresee the changes that shall be when we are gone, we should be less affected with changes in our own day. The ram with two horns was the second empire, that of Media and Persia. He saw this ram overcome by a he-goat. This was Alexander the Great. Alexander, when about thirty-three years of age, and in his full strength, died, and showed the vanity of worldly pomp and power, and that they cannot make a man happy. While men dispute, as in the case of Alexander, respecting the death of some prosperous warrior, it is plain that the great First Cause of all had no more of his plan for him to execute, and therefore cut him off. Instead of that one great horn, there came up four notable ones, Alexander's four chief captains. A little horn became a great persecutor of the church and people of God. It seems that the Mohammedan delusion is here pointed out. It prospered, and at one time nearly destroyed the holy religion God's right hand had planted. It is just with God to deprive those of the privileges of his house who despise and profane them; and to make those know the worth of ordinances by the want of them, who would not know it by the enjoyment of them. Daniel heard the time of this calamity limited and determined; but not the time when it should come. If we would know the mind of God, we must apply to Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; not hid from us, but hid for us. There is much difficulty as to the precise time here stated, but the end of it cannot be very distant. God will, for his own glory, see to the cleansing of the church in due time. Christ died to cleanse his church; and he will so cleanse it as to present it blameless to himself.</body></html>
