There is a difference here between the Q'ri and the K'thib. The latter reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, the hiphil of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, while the former reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e8;&#x5dd;</span>, the hophal of the same verb At first sight the difficulty is not lessened by consideration of the versions. The Septuagint as it at present stands is utterly unintelligible, "Until the leader of the host shall save the captivity, and by him everlasting mountains were broken down, and their place and sacrifice taken away, and he placed it in the very ground, and he prospered [reading with Syriac] and was, and the holy place shall be laid waste." This confusion is due to confluence of readings, and is not difficult to disentangle with the help of the Massoretic text. Up to the last two words the Septuagint is a translation of a text differing from the Massoretic simply by intelligible variations and repetitions not uncommon in the Septuagint. The first clause of the LXX. originally was probably, "Till the prince shall deliver the captivity," reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">shebee</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (tzaba) - a scribe, finding <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;</span> in his Hebrew, then added the translation of it to the margin of his Greek copy, from which it got into the text. The original of the LXX. had also <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">yatztzeel</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">hig'deel</span>) - a confusion easily made in the elder script, in which <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> were like. We learn from the Talmud (<span class="accented">Shabb.</span>, 103b) that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;</span> was liable to be mistaken by scribes for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;</span>. Moreover, "captivity" would naturally suggest <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e6;&#x5dc;</span>, "<span class="accented">to deliver."</span> The second clause is, "By him the everlasting mountains were broken down." Here <span class="accented">hayreem</span> has been read with the K'thib, and vocalized as if it were <span class="accented">hareem</span>, and <span class="accented">tameed</span>, "continual," translated as equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5dd;</span> ('<span class="accented">olam</span>), "everlasting." The next clause reveals the other meaning of <span class="accented">tameed</span>, "sacrifice," which probably had been written on the margin, and then dropped into the text. The latter part of the Septuagint verse appears to be confused with the latter part of the following verse according to the Massoretes. Theodotion is even less intelligible than the Septuagint, "Until the leader of the host shall save the captivity, and through him the sacrifice was broken down, and he prospered, and the holy place shall be made desolate." It is to be noticed that the first clause here agrees with the LXX. It is possible that "and he prospered" is a doublet, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> being read for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> in some copy. The Peshitta differs from beth the Greek versions, "Until it arrive to the chiefs of the host, and by it was set up in perpetuity, and preparing he strengthened the sanctuary," and while it is difficult to understand the origin of the variation in the first clause, it is clear that in the second clause the translator must have read <span class="accented">hish-leem</span> for <span class="accented">hooshlak.</span> The one thing that seems clear is that the reading of the K'thib is to be preferred. We should read <span class="accented">hayreem</span>, not <span class="accented">hooram.</span> Only the first of these could be read "mountains." If we translate the words as they stand, we shall certainly be removed out of the region of all the commentators. It is assumed that "the little horn" is the subject of this sentence; but "horn" is feminine in Hebrew, and the verbs here are in the masculine; this is against it being the nominative. The "prince of the host," then, must be the nominative of the verbs and subject of the sentence. The rendering of the first clause ought to be, then, "Until the prince of the host magnify himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-24.htm">1 Samuel 12:24</a>), and by himself he shall offer the daily sacrifice. And he shall cast down the foundation of his holy place," reading <span class="accented">hishlayk instead</span> of <span class="accented">hooshlak.</span> We should feel strongly in. clined to transfer the first "and" to <span class="accented">hayreem</span>, and, changing the punctuation, read, "Until the prince of the host shall make himself greater than he" - viz, the tyrant represented by "the little horn" - "and shall offer the daily sacrifice." If we might read <span class="accented">hishleem</span> with the Peshitta instead of <span class="accented">hoosh-lak</span>, we get a satisfactory meaning to the last clause, in which case we should render, "He shall complete the place of his sanctuary." We would understand by "complete," "to perfectly purify." Taking the Massoretic text thus with little modification, we have a description of the successes of Judas Maccabseus, who was prince of the host, and as such became stronger than Epiphanes, and then cleansed the temple, and offered the continual daily sacrifice. We give, as a curiosity, the note of Saadiah Gaon: "The King of Ishmael was more powerful than the kings of Rome who had Jerusalem, and he took Jerusalem from them by force." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-14 God gives Daniel a foresight of the destruction of other kingdoms, which in their day were as powerful as that of Babylon. Could we foresee the changes that shall be when we are gone, we should be less affected with changes in our own day. The ram with two horns was the second empire, that of Media and Persia. He saw this ram overcome by a he-goat. This was Alexander the Great. Alexander, when about thirty-three years of age, and in his full strength, died, and showed the vanity of worldly pomp and power, and that they cannot make a man happy. While men dispute, as in the case of Alexander, respecting the death of some prosperous warrior, it is plain that the great First Cause of all had no more of his plan for him to execute, and therefore cut him off. Instead of that one great horn, there came up four notable ones, Alexander's four chief captains. A little horn became a great persecutor of the church and people of God. It seems that the Mohammedan delusion is here pointed out. It prospered, and at one time nearly destroyed the holy religion God's right hand had planted. It is just with God to deprive those of the privileges of his house who despise and profane them; and to make those know the worth of ordinances by the want of them, who would not know it by the enjoyment of them. Daniel heard the time of this calamity limited and determined; but not the time when it should come. If we would know the mind of God, we must apply to Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; not hid from us, but hid for us. There is much difficulty as to the precise time here stated, but the end of it cannot be very distant. God will, for his own glory, see to the cleansing of the church in due time. Christ died to cleanse his church; and he will so cleanse it as to present it blameless to himself.</body></html>
