At this time (see <span class= "ital">Records of the Past,</span> vol. 1, p. 71, &c.) Susa was, as Daniel describes it, in the province of Elam; at a later period it became the capital of the Persian empire. Daniel was at Susa only in vision, he was not bodily transported thither. The Ulai is the river Eulaeus, and is mentioned in connection with Susa in the inscription cited above.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2</span> <span class="cmt_word">- And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai</span>. The LXX. presents several slight differences, "And I saw in the vision of my dream, when I was in the city Susa, which is in the province Elymais, and I seemed in my vision to be at the gate Ailam." Theodotion renders more briefly, "And I was in Susa the palace (<span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), in the province Ailam, and I was on the Ubal." The Syriac is in close agreement with the Massoretic. even to the transcription of the doubtful word <span class="accented">Ubal.</span> The transcription is carried so far that <span class="accented">medeenatha</span>, "a city," is used to translate <span class="accented">m'deena</span>, "a province." Jerome renders <span class="accented">mdeena</span>, <span class="accented">cicitas</span>, and <span class="accented">uval</span>, <span class="accented">portam</span>, and <span class="accented">beera</span>, <span class="accented">castrum.</span> The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> ('<span class="accented">oobal</span>) is nearly a <span class="accented">hapax legomenon</span>, absolutely so if we do not admit <span class="accented">joobal</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-8.htm">Jeremiah 17:8</a>, to be the same word. There is, as will have been seen above, great differences among the versions. The LXX. and Jerome seem to have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">oolam</span>), "porch" or "gate," instead of <span class="accented">oobal.</span> Ewald would make the word mean "river-basin," <span class="accented">Stromgebeit</span> - a view supported also by Zockler. In many respects "marsh" might be a more suitable rendering. To the south-west of the present ruins of Susa there is an extensive marsh, which may have been of old date. The preposition <span class="accented">liphnee</span>, which occurs in ver. 3, is all but meaningless applied to a river, if we use it in its ordinary meaning, "before." If we take it as meaning "eastward," the ram would be "westward" from Shushan, <span class="accented">ie.</span> between Shushan and the river; but as Daniel was in Shushan, he would naturally state the position of the "ram" in relation to it rather than to the river. The preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> ('<span class="accented">al</span>) is nearly as meaningless with regard to a river, unless a bridge or a boat is intended. We are inclined to read <span class="accented">oolam</span> as "porch." At the same time, we know that there was the river Ulai (Eulaeus) near Shushan. It is mentioned in one of the inscriptions of Asshurbanipal in connection with Shushan (Smith's 'Asshurbanipal,' p. 130). <span class="accented">The palace. B.C.era</span> really seems to mean "fortress." It occurs ten times in Esther, and always as the appellation of Shushan. In Nehemiah it is once used with this connotation, but twice in regard to some building in Jerusalem, probably the temple; in Chronicles it is used for the temple. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-2.htm">Ezra 6:2</a> it is used of Achmetha, equivalent to Ecbatana. From the fact that the LXX. translates <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, it might be reasoned that the translator had <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> before him, but the translation probably was due to ignorance of the precise meaning of the word. In Esther this word is rendered <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. In Nehemiah it is once rendered <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, once it is rendered <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, and once <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>. The derivation of the word seems to be from the <span class="cmt_word"></span> Assyrian <span class="accented">birtu.</span> It really means "citadel" or "fortress," and thus may be compared with the Carthaginian <span class="accented">byrsa.</span> Jerome's translation, <span class="accented">castrum</span>, suits this. It is not necessary to maintain that at this time Daniel was in Shushan. All that is implied is that in his dream he was there. Shushan is first referred to in the inscriptions of Asshur-bani-pal as the capital of Elam. In the history of that monarch there is an inscription of his given in which he says, "Shushan, the great city, the seat of their gods, the place of their oracle, I captured." Then follows a description of the plunder he took from it. We do not know when it recovered from that overthrow. The name is said to be derived from the number of lilies growing in the neighbourhood; but <span class="accented">shushan</span>, "a lily," is a Shemitie word, and the Elamites are usually regarded as an Aryan people. The association of Babylon with Elam and Media must have been intimate, if any credit is to be placed on the Greek accounts of the marriage of Nebuchadnezzar. Hence, even if Elam was not, at the date specified, a province of the Babylonian Empire, perhaps never was, yet the Babylonian. court might well have envoys visiting the court of Elam. We find from the well-known inscription of Nabunahid, that he regarded Cyrus at first as a friend and deliverer from the formidable Astyages, King of Umman-Manda. Daniel <span class="accented">may</span> have been sent to Elam, although there is no necessity for maintaining that this was the case. It was not until he had conquered Astyages that Cyrus held possession of Shushan. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-14 God gives Daniel a foresight of the destruction of other kingdoms, which in their day were as powerful as that of Babylon. Could we foresee the changes that shall be when we are gone, we should be less affected with changes in our own day. The ram with two horns was the second empire, that of Media and Persia. He saw this ram overcome by a he-goat. This was Alexander the Great. Alexander, when about thirty-three years of age, and in his full strength, died, and showed the vanity of worldly pomp and power, and that they cannot make a man happy. While men dispute, as in the case of Alexander, respecting the death of some prosperous warrior, it is plain that the great First Cause of all had no more of his plan for him to execute, and therefore cut him off. Instead of that one great horn, there came up four notable ones, Alexander's four chief captains. A little horn became a great persecutor of the church and people of God. It seems that the Mohammedan delusion is here pointed out. It prospered, and at one time nearly destroyed the holy religion God's right hand had planted. It is just with God to deprive those of the privileges of his house who despise and profane them; and to make those know the worth of ordinances by the want of them, who would not know it by the enjoyment of them. Daniel heard the time of this calamity limited and determined; but not the time when it should come. If we would know the mind of God, we must apply to Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; not hid from us, but hid for us. There is much difficulty as to the precise time here stated, but the end of it cannot be very distant. God will, for his own glory, see to the cleansing of the church in due time. Christ died to cleanse his church; and he will so cleanse it as to present it blameless to himself.</body></html>
