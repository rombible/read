Probably these words mean the same as the "abomination that maketh desolate" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-31.htm" title="And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that makes desolate.">Daniel 11:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-11.htm" title="And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that makes desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.">Daniel 12:11</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-59.htm" title="Now the five and twentieth day of the month they did sacrifice upon the idol altar, which was upon the altar of God.">1 Maccabees 1:59</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under</span> <span class="cmt_word">foot?</span> Our Authorized rendering is clearly mistaken; it ought not to be "saint," but "holy one," as in the Revised Version. The versions leave <span class="accented">palmoni</span>, "a certain one," untranslated. Fust's suggestion, held also by Behrmann, is that this is a contraction for <span class="accented">paloni almoni.</span> The renderings of the versions are worthy of note. The LXX., "And I heard one holy one speaking, and another holy one said to Phehnouni who spoke, How long shall the vision stand, and the removed sacrifice, and the sin of desolation given, and the holy place be desolate to be trodden underfoot (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>)<span class="accented">?"</span> Here the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "shall stand," is supposed by Professor Bevan to be an addition by one who did not fully comprehend the sentence. Following Gratz, Professor Bevan suggests a word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">mooram</span>), "removed," to explain the presence of <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> - <span class="accented">a</span> suggestion that appears well-founded. His further suggestion, that <span class="accented">sim</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>), "to set up," has been read instead of <span class="accented">shomaym</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>), must be due to inattention to the Greek. In it there is nothing about "set up," unless he transfers <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> from its place in the beginning of the sentence to the middle, and changes it to the active voice. Equally extraordinary is the suggestion that the translators read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e6;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;</span>, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5e6;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;</span>. The truth is, the introduction of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is probably due to a gloss or a confluence of readings. Theodotion is in close agreement with the Septuagint, save in the last clause, which he renders, "And the sanctuary and the power be trodden underfoot." The Peshitta is closer to the Massoretic, "And I heard a holy one who spake, and a holy one said to <span class="accented">palmoni</span>, who spake, When shall the vision of the perpetuity (daily sacrifice?), and of sin and of corruption be completed, and the holy place and the host be trodden underfoot?" The translators must have read <span class="accented">shahata</span> instead of <span class="accented">shomaym.</span> "Completed," <span class="accented">nesh-tlem</span>, may have been added, as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in the Greek, but the fact that all the versions have a word not represented in the Massoretic would indicate the probability that something has dropped out. Some part of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span> is suggested by the Greek Version, whereas some portion of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> is suggested by the Peshitta. Daniel hears one of those watching angels who desire to look into the evolution of the Divine purpose concerning man and his salvation, asking another, "How long shall be the desolation of Jerusalem under Epiphanes?" The irregular construction here suggests corruption. We would render the speech of the angel, "How long - the vision, the sacrifice - the sin of desolation to give the sanctuary and the service to be trodden underfoot?" as if Daniel had only heard snatches of what was said; we would, we may say, omit the "and" before "sanctuary." The Septuagint translators may have omitted <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">tzaba</span>), thinking only of its ordinary meaning, "host," forgetful of the fact that it is used of the temple service in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-23.htm">Numbers 4:23</a>. These angels are most interested in the length of time that the sanctuary shall remain desolate. This may indicate that it was evident, from the vision, that the period of desolation was a limited one. The scene presented to the imagination is striking. The seer, as he gazes on the vision appearing to him over the marsh at Susa, hears angelic voices that direct attention to what was most important to him and to his people. To the Israelites of the period of the Maccabees, the length of time that the temple service would be in abeyance was of the highest importance. It was well that they should know that the time was shortened for the elect's sake. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-14 God gives Daniel a foresight of the destruction of other kingdoms, which in their day were as powerful as that of Babylon. Could we foresee the changes that shall be when we are gone, we should be less affected with changes in our own day. The ram with two horns was the second empire, that of Media and Persia. He saw this ram overcome by a he-goat. This was Alexander the Great. Alexander, when about thirty-three years of age, and in his full strength, died, and showed the vanity of worldly pomp and power, and that they cannot make a man happy. While men dispute, as in the case of Alexander, respecting the death of some prosperous warrior, it is plain that the great First Cause of all had no more of his plan for him to execute, and therefore cut him off. Instead of that one great horn, there came up four notable ones, Alexander's four chief captains. A little horn became a great persecutor of the church and people of God. It seems that the Mohammedan delusion is here pointed out. It prospered, and at one time nearly destroyed the holy religion God's right hand had planted. It is just with God to deprive those of the privileges of his house who despise and profane them; and to make those know the worth of ordinances by the want of them, who would not know it by the enjoyment of them. Daniel heard the time of this calamity limited and determined; but not the time when it should come. If we would know the mind of God, we must apply to Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; not hid from us, but hid for us. There is much difficulty as to the precise time here stated, but the end of it cannot be very distant. God will, for his own glory, see to the cleansing of the church in due time. Christ died to cleanse his church; and he will so cleanse it as to present it blameless to himself.</body></html>
