Thus far the two main recensions are agreed. The Septuagint renders practically to the same effect as our version, only that <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> means rather "suspicions disturbed him," which is the rendering of Paulus Tellensis. There are traces in it of doublet; the rendering of the LXX. is, "And Daniel greatly marvelled, and suspicions disturbed him, and he was terrified, trembling having taken hold of him, and his visage was changed, having moved (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) his head, having been amazed one <span class="cmt_word"></span> hour, he answered me in a meek voice." Theodotion and the Peshitta are at one with the Massoretic text here. It is to be noted here that the word <span class="accented">sha'a</span>, translated "hour," has no such definite meaning; Gesenius gives, "a moment of time," in which he is followed by Bevan, Keil, and Stuart. Ewald translates, <span class="accented">eine Stunde</span>, and with him agree Hitzig, Kranichfeld, Zockler. Both the Greek versions have <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, but we must bear in mind that <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> had not the definite meaning which we attach to "hour." Jerome renders <span class="accented">hera.</span> The Septuagint adds, as we have seen, somewhat grotesquely, "having moved (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) his head, he was astonished for one hour." This seems a case of "doublet," that phenomenon so frequent in the Septuagint. The Septuagint rendering, "And (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>) Daniel was greatly astonished, and suspicions troubled him, and, trembling having seized him, he was afraid," suggests that it is not impossible that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d2;&#x5d9;</span>, "greatly," had been read instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e2;&#x5d4;</span>, "an hour;" but the rest is not so easily explicable. There is one case of Syriasm here in the vocalization of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee.</span> This clause is absent from both the Greek versions, though present in the Peshitta and Vulgate. As it stands, on the one hand, it is a departure from the epistolary style, or perhaps rather the proclamative style of the earlier portion of the chapter. On the other hand, if we think this clause an interpolation, we cannot fail to note that the kindly courtesy and consideration ascribed by the interpolator to Nebuchadnezzar is utterly unlike the character of Epiphanes as manifested to the Jews. Nebuchadnezzar saw that Daniel was filled with sorrow and apprehension at the meaning he saw in the vision, and endeavours to reassure and encourage him. If the conduct of Nebuchadnezzar is unlike that which a Jew of <span class="date">B.C. 170</span> would have ascribed to him were it his intention to present in him Epiphanes under a disguise, still more unlike is the conduct of Daniel to that which certainly would have been ascribed to him had the author intend(,d to represent him as a model of the pious Jew in a heathen court - in the court of Epi-phanes. Would Mattathias have remained astonished and speechless in the presence of Epiphanes, had it been revealed to him that Epiphanes was to be driven out to the wilds a madman? If, then, it is an interpolation, it is an early one - earlier than the Maccabean struggle. But if the interpolation be early, the book interpolated must be yet earlier. <span class="cmt_word">Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies</span>. The Septuagint maintains the epistolary character of this narrative here, "And Baltasar answered me with a meek voice, This dream be to those that hate thee, and let the interpretation thereof come upon thine enemies." Theodotion, the Peshitta, and the Vulgate are at one with the ordinary text. The feelings of Daniel towards Nebuchadnezzar seem to have been those of the highest personal loyalty, and thus in the widest contrast from the feelings that any Jew of the time of the Maccabees would have towards Epiphanes. He, Daniel, in his love for the grand impulsive despot, would have the enemies and haters of his monarch swept forth to wander as maniacs, rather than that he should so suffer. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:19-27 Daniel was struck with amazement and terror at so heavy a judgment coming upon so great a prince, and gives advice with tenderness and respect. It is necessary, in repentance, that we not only cease to do evil, but learn to do good. Though it might not wholly prevent the judgment, yet the trouble may be longer before it comes, or shorter when it does come. And everlasting misery will be escaped by all who repent and turn to God.</body></html>
