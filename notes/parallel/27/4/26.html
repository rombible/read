The Lord liveth in heaven, and his power is in all the earth." The last clause here is plainly a paraphrase of "the heavens do rule." "A season and an hour" is a doublet, and since it is to be observed that the phrase, "after that thou shalt have known," is omitted, we may deduce that <span class="accented">thindda</span>, "thou shalt know," is, by transposition of letters, read <span class="accented">l'iddan.</span> Theodotion, who is usually slavish in his following of the Aramaic construction, renders here, "And because they said, Suffer the stump (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>) of the roots of the tree." This suggests that in the text before Theodotion <span class="accented">mere</span> is omitted from <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">l'mishbaq</span>), and it was read <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">leishbaqoo</span>), meaning, according to the Mandaitic form of the verb, "they shall leave" - a form in accordance with the previous construction, then further altered to the second person plural. The end of the verse is also slightly different, "Until thou shalt know the heavenly power," reading here <span class="accented">shooltan dee shemya</span> instead of <span class="accented">shaltan shemya.</span> The Peshitta renders, "till thou shalt know that power is from the heaven (<span class="accented">min shemya</span>)." Mr. Bevan remarks on this usage of "heavens" for "God," which he compares with the Mishna and with the New Testament. He does not observe that the difficulty all the translators have with the phrase is a proof that, when the versions were made, it was even then not a common usage; hence that its introduction here was not due to the influence of the Mishnaic Hebrew stretching back, but was owing rather to the peculiar circumstances of Daniel. Professor Bevan's reference to the New Testament is mistaken. In no case in the New Testament is <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> used for "God." Even in the Greek Apocrypha is no usage precisely equivalent. Daniel, by using the phrase he did, put himself on the same level as the heathen king - pride against the gods (<span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), and of this, by implication, is Nebuchadnezzar here accused. Certainly the words of his inscriptions do not indicate anything of this sort. In fact, many of the phrases in the prayer to Marduk in the India House Inscription indicate reverent humility almost Christian. Still, these phrases might be due, to some extent, to political custom. The relation of a polytheist to his gods is a psychological enigma to a civilized monotheist. On the one hand, he recognizes his dependence on the god; on the other, he considers the god honoured by his worship, and therefore owing him certain duties in return. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:19-27 Daniel was struck with amazement and terror at so heavy a judgment coming upon so great a prince, and gives advice with tenderness and respect. It is necessary, in repentance, that we not only cease to do evil, but learn to do good. Though it might not wholly prevent the judgment, yet the trouble may be longer before it comes, or shorter when it does come. And everlasting misery will be escaped by all who repent and turn to God.</body></html>
