The passage in the Seventy which is parallel with this is partly in the last clause of the previous verse and partly in the verse that occupies a similar place to this in the Septuagint text, "The judgments of the great God shall come upon thee, and the Most High and his angels assail thee (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f72;</span>)." The change of tense here indicates that the second clause is an alternative rendering, brought into the text from the margin. In this marginal note <span class="accented">meta</span> has been taken as "assail," and <span class="accented">malka</span>, "O king," has been, by transposition of the two final letters, read <span class="accented">mela'k</span>, "angel." Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. The respectful tone in which Daniel addresses Nebuchadnezzar in the received text is to be observed; it is utterly alien to the boastful tone Judaism was afterwards accustomed to impute to its old saints. That there is no reference to the watchers or to their decree in this is imputed to Daniel's recognition of its true source; but in the Septuagint there is nothing equivalent to the statement in ver. 17. The fact that it is omitted here confirms the suspicion against it which we expressed in regard to the earlier verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:19-27 Daniel was struck with amazement and terror at so heavy a judgment coming upon so great a prince, and gives advice with tenderness and respect. It is necessary, in repentance, that we not only cease to do evil, but learn to do good. Though it might not wholly prevent the judgment, yet the trouble may be longer before it comes, or shorter when it does come. And everlasting misery will be escaped by all who repent and turn to God.</body></html>
