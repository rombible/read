(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-40.htm" title="And by your sword shall you live, and shall serve your brother; and it shall come to pass when you shall have the dominion, that you shall break his yoke from off your neck.">Genesis 27:40</a>, where it is foretold that Esau's posterity shall "break off" the yoke of Jacob.) In Chaldee the word is used for the most part in the sense of putting on one side. Daniel therefore counsels the king to rebel against his sins, such as pride, harshness, and cruelty towards his captives, and to put all these sins aside. And how can he do this in a better manner than by practising the contrary virtues?<p><span class= "bld">Righteousness.</span>--In all wars of conquest many acts of injustice are perpetrated. The king is warned here to show justice or to act justly for the future. Similar counsel is given, though in different language (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-8.htm" title="He has showed you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?">Micah 6:8</a>). The idea of "alms" and "redeeming" is not conveyed by the Chaldee words, so that the translation "redeem thy sins by alms" is incorrect and unwarrantable.<p><span class= "bld">If it may be</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> if Nebuchadnezzar will repent, his prosperity and peace will be prolonged.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity</span>. The Septuagint Version differs in this case somewhat considerably. It connects itself with the preceding verse, "Entreat him on account of thy sins, and to purify' all thine unrighteousness in almsgiving, in order that he may give thee humility, and many days on the throne of thy kingdom, and that thou be not destroyed." This version is paraphrastic and inferior as a whole to the text of the Massoretes, but at the same time, there must have been a different text to make such a rendering possible. Theodotion is more in accordance with the Massoretic text, but also has resemblances to the Septuagint here, "Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to thee, and atone for thy sins by almsgiving, and for thine unrighteousness by mercies to the poor (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), perchance (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>) God will be long-suffering to thy transgression." The last clause may be due to reading '<span class="accented">elaha</span>' (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5d0;</span>) for '<span class="accented">archu</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5db;&#x5d0;</span>), in which case the last clause would read, "God may be for thy tranquillity." In this case Theodotion's rendering is a natural paraphrase. The Peshitta is in agreement with the received text, save that <span class="accented">malka</span>, "king," is left out, possibly from its resemblance to <span class="accented">milki</span>, "my counsel." The Vulgate rendering is, "Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be pleasing unto thee, redeem thy sins by almsgiving, and thine iniquities by mercies to the poor; perchance he will forgive (<span class="accented">ignoscat</span>) thy sins." This follows Theodotion so far in the last clause, but not wholly, It is to be noticed that all the versions translate <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">tzid'qah</span>) "<span class="accented">almsgiving"</span> - a late meaning, and one not present in the Massoretic here. It can only be forced upon,this passage by giving <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">peraq</span>) a meaning it never has, as Professor Bevan and Keil show it to mean "to break," and as breaking a yoke meant "setting free," it thus meant redeeming a person; but in the sense of paying a ransom for sins, it never is used, even in the Targums. There is, therefore, a wide difference between the moral standpoint of the writer of Daniel and that of his translators - so wide that the writer of Daniel does not see the possibility of his words being twisted to this meaning. In Ecclesiasticus almsgiving is made equivalent to righteousness. The writer of Daniel is on a different moral plane from Ben Sira. But more, Daniel must have been translated into Greek before Ecclesiasticus, as the whole canon was translated when the grandson of Ben Sira had come down to Egypt, and this at the latest was <span class="date">B.C. 135</span>; on the critical hypothesis, not a score of years separate the text of Daniel from the translation. The courteous beginning of Daniel's speech is to be observed; he is anxious to win the king to repentance. Compare the stern, unrelenting demeanour of Elijah to Ahab, and of Elisha to Jehoram. If we compare this with the way the Jews of Talmudic times regard the memory of Titus, the Roman captor of Jerusalem, we see we are in a totally different atmosphere from that in which the Jewish <span class="accented">folsarius</span> of any period of Jewish history could have lived. A grand impulsive character like Nebuchadnezzar could not but at once allure and awe the young Jew, but a zealous Jew would have regarded it as derogatory to imagine this of a prophet of the Lord, and so we see the Septuagint translator drops the courteous words with which Daniel introduces his <span class="accented">advice.</span> Daniel looked upon the fact that the warning had been given as an evidence that there might be a place for repentance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:19-27 Daniel was struck with amazement and terror at so heavy a judgment coming upon so great a prince, and gives advice with tenderness and respect. It is necessary, in repentance, that we not only cease to do evil, but learn to do good. Though it might not wholly prevent the judgment, yet the trouble may be longer before it comes, or shorter when it does come. And everlasting misery will be escaped by all who repent and turn to God.</body></html>
