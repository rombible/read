Theodotion and the Peshitta both have this passage, but with slight variations from the Massoretic text. Instead of "No secret troubleth [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5e1;</span>, '<span class="accented">anays</span>, 'compel,' <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-8.htm">Esther 1:8</a>] thee," Thedotion renders, "No secret (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) baffles (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) thee." The Peshitta renders. "And no secret is hid (<span class="accented">ethcasee</span>) from thee," reading, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5e1;</span>, probably <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. Behrmann, who translates the word by <span class="accented">verborgen</span>, thinks the choice of the word occasioned by <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-3.htm">Ezekiel 28:3</a>, "<span class="accented">No</span> secret is hid from thee" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5da;</span>), this last word, he thinks, occasioning the use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5e1;</span>; but <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>: is used in Aramaic (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-6.htm">Leviticus 13:6</a>, "dark" of the spot of leprosy). It seems more probable that there is some mistake in the reading. The Massoretic reading of the last clause seems modelled on the situation in the second chapter, where Nebuchadnezzar demands of the magicians that they not only give the interpretation of the dream, but tell the dream itself. The versions here do not agree with the Massoretic. Theodotion renders, "Hear the vision (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) of the dream which I saw, and tell me its interpretation." The Peshitta has, "In the vision of my dream I was seeing visions of my head, and tell me the interpretation." The Massoretic reading contradicts the situation, and the variety of reading in the two versions confirms the suspicion of this verse induced by its absence from the Septuagint. "Master of the magicians" (<span class="accented">rob-hartum-maya</span>). There is nothing in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-48.htm">Daniel 2:48</a> about the promotion of Daniel over the "magi-clans," but only over the "governors (<span class="accented">signeen</span>) of the wise men (<span class="accented">hakaymeen</span>) of Babylon" This is not to be in itself regarded as a proof of antagonism between these verses and the earlier portion of the, book, as Daniel might have been promoted in the interval. The Peshitta calls Daniel <span class="accented">rab-hahmeen</span>, "chief of the wise men;" Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. It is also to be observed that the writer of these verses does not make Daniel <span class="accented">rab-mag</span>, which so generally was anciently understood to mean "master of the magicians." Avoiding an alluring blunder is often as clear a proof of knowledge as a directly correct statement. "Spirit of the holy gods;" not "<span class="accented">the</span> Spirit," but "<span class="accented">a</span> spirit." The Authorized Version is here correct in translating "gods," not "God," as the adjective is plural; not as Theodotion, who renders, "a holy spirit of God," reading, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-18 The beginning and end of this chapter lead us to hope, that Nebuchadnezzar was a monument of the power of Divine grace, and of the riches of Divine mercy. After he was recovered from his madness, he told to distant places, and wrote down for future ages, how God had justly humbled and graciously restored him. When a sinner comes to himself, he will promote the welfare of others, by making known the wondrous mercy of God. Nebuchadnezzar, before he related the Divine judgments upon him for his pride, told the warnings he had in a dream or vision. The meaning was explained to him. The person signified, was to be put down from honour, and to be deprived of the use of his reason seven years. This is surely the sorest of all temporal judgments. Whatever outward affliction God is pleased to lay upon us, we have cause to bear it patiently, and to be thankful that he continues the use of our reason, and the peace of our consciences. Yet if the Lord should see fit by such means to keep a sinner from multiplying crimes, or a believer from dishonouring his name, even the dreadful prevention would be far preferable to the evil conduct. God has determined it, as a righteous Judge, and the angels in heaven applaud. Not that the great God needs the counsel or concurrence of the angels, but it denotes the solemnity of this sentence. The demand is by the word of the holy ones, God's suffering people: when the oppressed cry to God, he will hear. Let us diligently seek blessings which can never be taken from us, and especially beware of pride and forgetfulness of God.</body></html>
