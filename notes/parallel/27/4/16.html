The period intended by "time" is very uncertain: from the use of the word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-10.htm" title="And Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and your victuals. So the Levite went in.">Judges 17:10</a> it has been inferred that "years" are intended. This is purely conjectural. It is more probable that the word is used to signify some definite period of time, which, as appears from the words "over him," was in some way marked out by the heavenly bodies. The word "time" is used by Daniel in the same sense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm" title="And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.">Daniel 7:25</a>). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-7.htm" title="And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was on the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and swore by him that lives for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.">Daniel 12:7</a>, where, however, a different word is employed.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let</span> <span class="cmt_word">his heart be changed from</span> <span class="cmt_word">man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass ever him.</span> The Septuagint rendering seems to be taken from the previous verse, "And let his body be changed by the dew of heaven, and let him be pastured with them seven years." It seems difficult to imagine, either, on the one hand, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">libebayh</span>) changed into <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">pi</span>g<span class="accented">erah</span>), the word by which Paulus Tellensis translates <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, though it suggests "carcase," or into <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">nid nayh</span>), the word used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-15.htm">Daniel 7:15</a>; or, on the other, that either of these should be read <span class="accented">lebab.</span> At the same time, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span> are not unlike in old inscriptions, nor <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;</span> unlike <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;</span>; any indistinctness in the third letter might easily lead to a mistake. It is not impossible that some of the words in the latter part of the previous verse have been modified from some word meaning "body." It is equally difficult to guess what word has been read by the Septuagint translator instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">yah-lephoon</span>), "let them pass over." The greater brevity of the Septuagint is in its favour. Theodotion is, as usual, in closer agreement with the Massoretic; he renders <span class="accented">min-anaosha</span> or <span class="accented">anosha</span>' for <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "from men" - a possible translation, and one favoured by some recent commentators. The Peshitta agrees quite with the received text. According to the received text, the main change was mental - the human heart is removed, and the heart of a beast given. On the other hand, in the twenty-third verse, in which we have the fulfilment of the dream, the change is mainly physical, and it is to be observed that the change is produced by "the dew of heaven." <span class="accented">Seven times.</span> The word '<span class="accented">iddanun</span>, "times," is a matter of some difficulty; it means really "seasons" or "points" of time, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:2</a>, Targum, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-1.htm">Genesis 38:1</a>, Targum Onkelos, "It came to pass at this time." It is purely arbitrary to fix the meaning here as "years," as is done by the Septuagint and by many commentators. Theodotiom keeps the indefinite<span class="accented">ness</span> of the original by rendering the word here <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>. The Peshitta transfers the word. It may be" months" as suggested by Lenormant; it maybe "seasons," in our usual sense of the word. Rendel Harris's 'Biblical Monuments,' p. 73, says, "Summer and winter are the only seasons counted in Babylonia;" if so, seven '<span class="accented">iddaneen</span> would be nearly four years. From the fact that exposure to weather is the point of importance, Mr. Harris's view is not impossible; but pathological reasons suggest "months" (see Excursus at the end of chapter). <span class="accented">Seven</span>, with the Babylonians, as with most other Semites, is a round number of sacred import, and therefore may not be pressed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-18 The beginning and end of this chapter lead us to hope, that Nebuchadnezzar was a monument of the power of Divine grace, and of the riches of Divine mercy. After he was recovered from his madness, he told to distant places, and wrote down for future ages, how God had justly humbled and graciously restored him. When a sinner comes to himself, he will promote the welfare of others, by making known the wondrous mercy of God. Nebuchadnezzar, before he related the Divine judgments upon him for his pride, told the warnings he had in a dream or vision. The meaning was explained to him. The person signified, was to be put down from honour, and to be deprived of the use of his reason seven years. This is surely the sorest of all temporal judgments. Whatever outward affliction God is pleased to lay upon us, we have cause to bear it patiently, and to be thankful that he continues the use of our reason, and the peace of our consciences. Yet if the Lord should see fit by such means to keep a sinner from multiplying crimes, or a believer from dishonouring his name, even the dreadful prevention would be far preferable to the evil conduct. God has determined it, as a righteous Judge, and the angels in heaven applaud. Not that the great God needs the counsel or concurrence of the angels, but it denotes the solemnity of this sentence. The demand is by the word of the holy ones, God's suffering people: when the oppressed cry to God, he will hear. Let us diligently seek blessings which can never be taken from us, and especially beware of pride and forgetfulness of God.</body></html>
