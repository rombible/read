According to the use of the word in Chaldee elsewhere, this can be the only true meaning. The "holy one" makes this request of God, and the carrying out of His decree pertains to the "watcher." "This," says Dr. Pusey, "gives another glimpse into the interest of the holy angels in ourselves. They, too, longed that oppression should cease, and joining in the cry which for ever is going up from the oppressed to the throne of mercy and judgment, prayed for that chastisement which was to relieve the oppressed and convert the oppressor" (<span class= "ital">Lectures on Daniel,</span> p. 525).<p><span class= "bld">Ruleth</span> . . .--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Almighty God disposes of human empires as He pleases.

In this verse the difference between the Septuagint text - we mean the text behind that version - and that of the Massoretes is great. It is as follows: "Until he know the Lord of heaven to have power over all things which are in heaven and on the earth, and such things as he willeth to do, he doeth." This, as may be observed, is very much briefer than the Massoretic, and hence, to a certain extent, to be preferred. It is, however, difficult to imagine the genesis of the one from the other, as they have only two words in common in a similar connection, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d8;</span> (<span class="accented">shaleet</span>) and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">yinedeoon</span>)' If we start with the supposition that the Massoretic text is the primary, we have a difficulty in seeing what reason induced this peculiar form of condensation. Had it been to get rid of <span class="accented">the decree of the watchers</span>, <span class="accented">and the demand of the holy ones</span>, that clause might have been simply omitted, and the sense would have given no sign of anything having been omitted. If, again, we start with the Septuagint text as our basis, it is difficult to understand what led to the insertion of "the decree of the watchers" and "the demand of the holy ones." Of course, the period of the Persian domination and that of the early Greek supremacy was one in which the angelic hierarchy was enormously increased and made vastly more complex than it had been before. Further, it is to be noted that "the watchers," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> ('<span class="accented">ereen</span>), are here distinguished absolutely from "the holy ones," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">gad-deesbeen</span>), whereas in ver. 10 (13) "the watchers" and "the holy ones" are identified. This distinction is made in later Jewish commentators, and therefore its. presence here, fin contradistinction to ver. 13, is proof of a relatively late origin for this clause. Zockler would avoid this by asserting a parallelism of members in this sentence; but, in the first place, this is not verse, but prose, and therefore parallelism need not be expected. Further, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d6;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">gezayrath</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> "a decree" given by a person in authority, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">sh'alayth</span>) is "a petition" presented to one in authority. So far from the two being identified in the verse before us, the watchers and the holy ones are as absolutely contrasted as they can be. Bevan simply appeals to ver. 10 (13) to prove their identity - sense has no influence with him. When we turn to Theodotion, we find that, in his practical identity with the Massoretic text, he has preserved the contrast between "<span class="accented">decree"</span> and "<span class="accented">petition</span>," the former word being represented by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, and the second by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. These two words represent fairly well the distinction between <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">gezayrath</span>), and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">sh'alayth</span>). It is probable that <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is used instead of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in order to show that <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;</span> is to be regarded as genitive plural. The Peshitta follows the Massoretic, but less closely. It has <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, "watcher," in the singular. This clause in the Syriac should be rendered, "according to the decrees of the watcher is this order, and according to the word of the holy one is the request;" it retains the distinction in question much as it is in the received text, but with a distinct difference of meaning in regard to the ether words of the clause. So, too, Jerome in the Vulgate translates, "In sententia vigilum decretum eat et sermo sanctorum et petitio," thus maintaining, in all the confusion there is in this rendering, the distinction we have referred to. In the final clause, the Vulgate is further astray from the Massoretic. translating, <span class="accented">super eum.</span> The theology of this passage is singular, so singular that, were it not for the omission of the passage from the Septuagint. and its contradiction of ver. 13, we might be inclined to think it must be genuine. (For a similar statement, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>, "The Law... was ordained by angels;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>, "If the word spoken by angels was steadfast.") The view seems to be that the Almighty had a council of angels, and before them was every question discussed ere it was decreed. In short, that there was a heavenly sanhedrin, corresponding to that on earth - an idea which was developed by the Talmudists. It appears in Enoch, not vet fully developed. In Enoch 12. certain of the watchers are denounced as having defiled themselves with women; in ch. 20. we have the name of the holy angels who watch, and in this chapter we have the different provinces assigned to each of them. Six are enumerated. They have thus no collective function. In the portion of Enoch preserved in Syncellus, men are represented as calling to the heavens, and addressing them; and the four angels, Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel, give answer by looking down upon the earth, and they see the blood that is being shed by violence. Then follows the statement, "And the four archangels came before the Lord, and said." They may be here said to act in a collective capacity, but they have no deliberative function, still less have they any power to decree. The interpolated verse before us thus represents an angelo-logy more developed than that of the date of the Book of Enoch. <span class="accented">And setteth up over it the basest of men.</span> This phrase <span class="accented">suggests</span> the "vile person," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">nibezeh</span>), of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-21.htm">Daniel 11:21</a>, who is probably Epiphanes - the reference in this interpolated verse is not unlikely the same. The Syriac form of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;</span> in the K'thib has to be observed. One peculiarity which points to interpolation is the Hebrew plural here used, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">anasheem</span>). Were it not that our <span class="accented">suspicions</span> of this verse are deepened by examination of it, we should be inclined to see a reference to that usurpation of Nebuchadnezzar's throne, which Lenormant thinks is implied in the title Neriglissar gives to his father. There seems to be a reference to something like this in ver. 24 of this chapter, according to the version of the LXX. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-18 The beginning and end of this chapter lead us to hope, that Nebuchadnezzar was a monument of the power of Divine grace, and of the riches of Divine mercy. After he was recovered from his madness, he told to distant places, and wrote down for future ages, how God had justly humbled and graciously restored him. When a sinner comes to himself, he will promote the welfare of others, by making known the wondrous mercy of God. Nebuchadnezzar, before he related the Divine judgments upon him for his pride, told the warnings he had in a dream or vision. The meaning was explained to him. The person signified, was to be put down from honour, and to be deprived of the use of his reason seven years. This is surely the sorest of all temporal judgments. Whatever outward affliction God is pleased to lay upon us, we have cause to bear it patiently, and to be thankful that he continues the use of our reason, and the peace of our consciences. Yet if the Lord should see fit by such means to keep a sinner from multiplying crimes, or a believer from dishonouring his name, even the dreadful prevention would be far preferable to the evil conduct. God has determined it, as a righteous Judge, and the angels in heaven applaud. Not that the great God needs the counsel or concurrence of the angels, but it denotes the solemnity of this sentence. The demand is by the word of the holy ones, God's suffering people: when the oppressed cry to God, he will hear. Let us diligently seek blessings which can never be taken from us, and especially beware of pride and forgetfulness of God.</body></html>
