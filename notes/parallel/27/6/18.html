The root whence it is derived means <span class= "ital">to rejoice,</span> but what is signified cannot be exactly ascertained.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the king went to his palace. and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep went from him.</span> In the Massoretic text one of the clauses, "Neither were instruments of music brought before him," has caused great difficulty. The word <span class="accented">dahvan</span>, translated "instruments of music," is rendered by Furst, "dancing-girl; "Gesenius, "concubine; "Rosenmuller renders, "odours." The Mediaeval Greek Version translates, "instruments of music." Furst speaks with favour of the Syriac rendering, "food-tables." <span class="accented">Han'ayl</span>, the aphel of '<span class="accented">eilal</span>, has to be noted as a sign of antiquity. The version of the Septuagint is very wide from the Massoretic in the latter part of the verse, "Thus the king returned to his palace, and went to bed fasting, being grieved about Daniel." It is evident that the Septuagint translator had before him <span class="accented">deheel</span> instead of <span class="accented">dohvan</span> - <span class="accented">nun</span> in the script of Egyptian Aramaic is very like <span class="accented">lamed</span> in the later mode writing, as also <span class="accented">yodh</span> and <span class="accented">vav</span>. It is possible that the name "Daniel" was read <span class="accented">han'eel or</span>, <span class="accented">vies versa</span>, as two of the letters are identical If we can accept the Septuagint reading, the difficulty of this mysterious <span class="accented">dahoun</span> disappears. Another clause is added here in the Septuagint from ver. 22 (23) Massoretic, though with variations. "Then the God of Daniel, taking thought for him (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) closed the mouths of the lions, that they did not hurt Daniel." This statement is not inserted in Daniel's answer to the king in the Septuagint, as it is in the Massoretic text. It would almost seem that our present text in both cases is a condensation of a more extended document. This view receives support from the rendering of Theodotion, "And the king departed to his house, and went to bed supperless, and viands were not brought to him, and his sleep went from him, and God closed the mouths of the lions, and they did not hurt Daniel." It will be seen that the last clause here agrees with the concluding clause of the Septuagint. The mysterious word <span class="accented">dahvan is</span> rendered here "food" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) - a version that is suspicious from the fact that it merely repeats, under another form, the statement that the king went to bed fasting. It is supported by the Peshitta and the Vulgate. This difference can scarcely be due to a various reading. Otherwise the Peshitta and the Vulgate agree with the Massoretic text. The king's sorrow and humiliation could not be better pictured than it is here: even the feast of the palace had no pleasure for him, he was so grieved about Daniel. But we must also bear in mind that fasting had among the Jews, and, indeed, in the East generally, a relationship to prayer (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>, where fasting takes the place of prayer; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-3.htm">Daniel 10:3</a>). It means also repentance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6-8</a>). Darius, then, repented his hasty decree, and prayed for the deliverance of Daniel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:18-24 The best way to have a good night, is to keep a good conscience. We are sure of what the king doubted, that the servants of the living God have a Master well able to protect them. See the power of God over the fiercest creatures, and believe his power to restrain the roaring lion that goeth about continually seeking to devour. Daniel was kept perfectly safe, because he believed in his God. Those who boldly and cheerfully trust in God to protect them in the way of duty, shall always find him a present help. Thus the righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead. The short triumph of the wicked will end in their ruin.</body></html>
