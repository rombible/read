Now the king spoke and said to Daniel, Your God whom you serve continually, he will deliver you.">Daniel 6:16</a> he expressed a vague hope that God would protect His servant. That hope seems now to have died out, though afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-26.htm" title="I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and steadfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even to the end.">Daniel 6:26</a>) it appears stronger than that of Nebuchadnezzar. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-37.htm" title="Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.">Daniel 4:37</a>.) The phrase "living God" is remarkable, coming as it does from a heathen king. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-36.htm" title="Your servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.">1Samuel 17:36</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:18-24 The best way to have a good night, is to keep a good conscience. We are sure of what the king doubted, that the servants of the living God have a Master well able to protect them. See the power of God over the fiercest creatures, and believe his power to restrain the roaring lion that goeth about continually seeking to devour. Daniel was kept perfectly safe, because he believed in his God. Those who boldly and cheerfully trust in God to protect them in the way of duty, shall always find him a present help. Thus the righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead. The short triumph of the wicked will end in their ruin.</body></html>
