But besides the enemy, the "prince of the covenant" is to be destroyed also. This expression is most readily explained by observing that it stands in contrast with the hostile armies mentioned in the first clause. It is an expression similar to "men of covenant," "lords of covenant," and means "those who were at peace with him," "prince" being used as a collective noun (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-18.htm" title="After this shall he turn his face to the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn on him.">Daniel 11:18</a>). This has been supposed to refer to the murder of Onias III. (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/4-1.htm" title="This Simon now, of whom we spake afore, having been a betrayer of the money, and of his country, slandered Onias, as if he had terrified Heliodorus, and been the worker of these evils.">2 Maccabees 4:1</a>, &c., <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/4-33.htm" title="Which when Onias knew of a surety, he reproved him, and withdrew himself into a sanctuary at Daphne, that lieth by Antiochia.">2 Maccabees 4:33</a>, &c.); but there is no reason for supposing that the high priest was ever called by such a title as "prince of the covenant."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant</span>. The rendering of the LXX. is very wide of this, "And the broken arms he shall break from before him." Although this is much shorter than the Massoretic text, yet the contradictory assertion that arms already broken are broken before him is conclusive against accepting the evidence of the Septuagint absolutely. Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic, not with the English versinns, "And the arms of the overflowing shall be overflowed from before him, and be broken, even the leader of the covenant." The Peshitta is widely different, alike from the Massoretic text and that of the Septuagint, ";And their mighty ones of the city he shall carry away, and they shall be broken from before him, even the leader of the covenant." The Vulgate stands in a closer relation with the above than with the Massoretic text or the Greek versions, "The arms (<span class="accented">brachia</span>) of one fighting shall be driven out (<span class="accented">expugnabuntur</span>) from his face, and shall be broken besides, and (<span class="accented">insuper et</span>) the leader of the covenant." The reference here seems to be to the campaign' - if there was a campaign - by which Epiphanes secured possession of the throne of Syria. <span class="accented">The prince of the covenant.</span> Who this can be it is impossible to say. The idea supported by Hitzig, Bevan, Behrmann, that Onias III. is referred to, is founded on the utterly unhistorical narrative in 2 Macc. 4. The view of Moses Stuart is that it is some sovereign who had a league of amity with Epiphanes. The reference thus might be to Eumenes or Attalus, who supported the claims of Anthochs. <span class="accented">Negeed bereeth</span> may be explanatory of the prenominal suffix in <span class="accented">milpanayo</span>, "before <span class="accented">him."</span> As Stuart acutely remarks, had the reference in be<span class="accented">reeth</span> been to the Divine covenant with the Jews, we should have had <span class="accented">habbeereth.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-30 The angel shows Daniel the succession of the Persian and Grecian empires. The kings of Egypt and Syria are noticed: Judea was between their dominions, and affected by their contests. From ver. 5-30, is generally considered to relate to the events which came to pass during the continuance of these governments; and from ver. 21, to relate to Antiochus Epiphanes, who was a cruel and violent persecutor of the Jews. See what decaying, perishing things worldly pomp and possessions are, and the power by which they are gotten. God, in his providence, sets up one, and pulls down another, as he pleases. This world is full of wars and fightings, which come from men's lusts. All changes and revolutions of states and kingdoms, and every event, are plainly and perfectly foreseen by God. No word of God shall fall to the ground; but what he has designed, what he has declared, shall infallibly come to pass. While the potsherds of the earth strive with each other, they prevail and are prevailed against, deceive and are deceived; but those who know God will trust in him, and he will enable them to stand their ground, bear their cross, and maintain their conflict.</body></html>
