<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-28.htm" title="Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?">Jeremiah 22:28</a>. The moral character of the man is especially described. The words that follow explain more fully that he was not worthy of receiving royal majesty. This person is generally identified with Antiochus Epiphanes. The description certainly agrees with him very closely. In fact, just as his predecessors resembled in various points the kings spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/11-1.htm" title="Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.">Daniel 11:1-20</a>, so Antiochus resembles the person here described. The language of St. Jerome about early interpreters of the Book of Daniel is striking: "<span class= "ital">Cumque multa qu? postea lecturi et exposituri sumus super Antiochi persona conveniant, typum eum volunt Antichristi habere, et qu? in illo ex parte pr?ceperint, in Antichristo ex toto esse complenda.</span>"<p><span class= "bld">Peaceably.--</span>Unexpectedly, as LXX. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-25.htm" title="And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.">Daniel 8:25</a>.) The king is here represented as taking possession of the kingdom by craft, and in the following clause he is said to gain his end by "flatteries," or by intrigues and cunning hypocritical conduct. It does not appear that this was done by Antiochus Epiphanes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries</span>. As said above, the opening clause of this verse, as it appears in the Septuagint, really belongs to the previous verse, "And there shall stand up in his place a mean person (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), and the glory of a king shall not be given to him, and he shall come suddenly, and the king shall be strong in his inheritance." Evidently the translator, has omitted the reduplication and has derived the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">halaqlaqqoth</span>) from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">hel</span> <span class="accented">qah</span>), "a portion," "an inheritance." Theodotion's rendering is not very intelligible, "On his preparation he shall be set at naught, and they shall not give to him the glory of the kingdom, he shall come in prosperously (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>), and shall overpower the king dom by flatteries." It is, however, more in accordance with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta is in practical agreement with the Massoretic, and the Vulgate reads as if a rendering of the Peshitta. It is assumed that this is Antiochus Epiphanes, yet there are considerable difficulties. A vile <span class="accented">person.</span> Certainly he was morally vile enough, though not nearly so vile as some of the kings of Egypt, his contemporaries, or some of his own ancestors. The meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d1;&#x5d6;&#x5d4;</span> is "rejected, despised" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>). It may be that it was derived from the idea that the Romans rejected Epiphanes as a hostage, and demanded Demetrius the son of Seleucus instead, and so Epiphanes got the opportunity of returning to Syria. This, however, is not the aspect which the matter assumes in Appian. Seleucus appears as the party desiring the change of hostage. <span class="accented">To whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom.</span> That certainly is not the case; he had the kingdom as much as his brother had; he was acknowledged as king. He certainly had not the power his father had before his defeat at Magnesia, but he had as much as the semi-subject conditions of Syria permitted. <span class="accented">He shall come in peaceably.</span> That also is doubtful, for Eumenes of Pergamos supported his claims with an army. <span class="accented">Obtain the kingdom by flatteries.</span> Even that is not a prominent feature of the accession of Antiochus. The Septuagint, as will be seen, separates between the vile person who should not have the glory of the kingdom given to him, and the king who should be strong in his inheritance. If we were sure that Appian had followed Polybius, we might see in the first part of the verse Heliodorus, and in the second the coming of Epiphanes. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-30 The angel shows Daniel the succession of the Persian and Grecian empires. The kings of Egypt and Syria are noticed: Judea was between their dominions, and affected by their contests. From ver. 5-30, is generally considered to relate to the events which came to pass during the continuance of these governments; and from ver. 21, to relate to Antiochus Epiphanes, who was a cruel and violent persecutor of the Jews. See what decaying, perishing things worldly pomp and possessions are, and the power by which they are gotten. God, in his providence, sets up one, and pulls down another, as he pleases. This world is full of wars and fightings, which come from men's lusts. All changes and revolutions of states and kingdoms, and every event, are plainly and perfectly foreseen by God. No word of God shall fall to the ground; but what he has designed, what he has declared, shall infallibly come to pass. While the potsherds of the earth strive with each other, they prevail and are prevailed against, deceive and are deceived; but those who know God will trust in him, and he will enable them to stand their ground, bear their cross, and maintain their conflict.</body></html>
