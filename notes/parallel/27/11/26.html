The false companions of the southern king betray him to the enemy; he is broken, the hostile army pours in, and many are slain. This has been referred to the second campaign of Antiochus in Egypt; however, history is silent of any treachery against Physcon. St. Jerome remarks: "<span class= "ital">Nostri secundum superiorem sensum interpretantur omnia de Antichristo qui nasciturus est de populo Jud?orum, et de Babylone venturus, primum superaturus est regem Egypti, qui est unus de tribus cornibus."</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain</span>. The Septuagint rendering here is different, "And his cares shall consume him and turn him away, and he shall pass by (and shall hiss, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>); and many shall fall down wounded." Paulus Tellensis renders <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> by (<span class="accented">nigrooph</span>), "shall overflow," as if he had read <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, or perhaps <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, though it does not exactly represent the Hebrew. Theodotion is liker the Massoretic , "And they eat his provisions, and shall break him to pieces; and he shall overflow powers, and many shall fall wounded." The account of the invasion of Egypt by Epiphanes occurs in 1 Macc. 1:18. The Septuagint translator, appears to have read, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">veochlay path-bago</span>), <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">veachloo dageothav</span>). There would seem also to have been some confusion between <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">heel</span>), "strength," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5dc;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">halach</span>), "to go." The Peshitta rendering is, "They that eat his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall be dispersed, and many shall fall wounded." The Vulgate is closely related to this. This refers to the treachery which was alleged to have been at work and to have caused the overthrow of Philometor in his contest with his uncle. The version of the Septuagint is more picturesque, and more in accordance with facts. Cares might well devour Ptolemy Philometor - treachery in his army and his brother occupying his throne. Certainly he was defeated, turned asae, and was compelled to accompany the victor as a prisoner, while Egypt was wasted (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-30 The angel shows Daniel the succession of the Persian and Grecian empires. The kings of Egypt and Syria are noticed: Judea was between their dominions, and affected by their contests. From ver. 5-30, is generally considered to relate to the events which came to pass during the continuance of these governments; and from ver. 21, to relate to Antiochus Epiphanes, who was a cruel and violent persecutor of the Jews. See what decaying, perishing things worldly pomp and possessions are, and the power by which they are gotten. God, in his providence, sets up one, and pulls down another, as he pleases. This world is full of wars and fightings, which come from men's lusts. All changes and revolutions of states and kingdoms, and every event, are plainly and perfectly foreseen by God. No word of God shall fall to the ground; but what he has designed, what he has declared, shall infallibly come to pass. While the potsherds of the earth strive with each other, they prevail and are prevailed against, deceive and are deceived; but those who know God will trust in him, and he will enable them to stand their ground, bear their cross, and maintain their conflict.</body></html>
