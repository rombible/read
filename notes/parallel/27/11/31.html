Apparently the two words are a name for the Temple, which is so called because it was the spiritual support of God's people, as well as a very powerful fortress. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-4.htm" title="For you have been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.">Isaiah 25:4</a>, &c.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/31-2.htm" title="Bow down your ear to me; deliver me speedily: be you my strong rock, for an house of defense to save me.">Psalm 31:2-4</a>; and compare <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-44.htm" title="For the king had sent letters by messengers unto Jerusalem and the cities of Juda that they should follow the strange laws of the land,">1 Maccabees 1:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/6-7.htm" title="Also that they had pulled down the abomination, which he had set up upon the altar in Jerusalem, and that they had compassed about the sanctuary with high walls, as before, and his city Bethsura.">1 Maccabees 6:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/6-4.htm" title="For the temple was filled with riot and revelling by the Gentiles, who dallied with harlots, and had to do with women within the circuit of the holy places, and besides that brought in things that were not lawful.">2 Maccabees 6:4</a>, which speak of the various deeds of Antiochus upon this occasion.) On the daily sacrifice, and on the abomination of desolation, see the Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-13.htm" title="Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said to that certain saint which spoke, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?">Daniel 8:13</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And arms shall stand on hie part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice</span>, <span class="cmt_word">and they shall place the abomination</span> <span class="cmt_word">that maketh desolate.</span> The render* ing of the LXX. is close to the above, "And arms shall stand by him, and shall pollute the sanctuary of fear " - probably the LXX. read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">magor</span>), "fear," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5d6;</span> (<span class="accented">ma'oz</span>), "fortress," a change probably due to the fact that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;</span> sounded in Greek ears like <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> hard, <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> - and they shall take away the sacrifice and place (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span> give) the abomination of desolation." Theodotion, from a mistaken vocalization, renders, "And seeds " - reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> - "shall spring up from him and shall pollute the sanctuary of power, and shall change the continual (sacrifice), and shall place (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>) the abomination of things that have disappeared (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)." The Peshitta is quite different in the firs; clause, "And their strong ones shall arise from them, and they pollute the sanctuary of strength, and they cause the sacrifice (<span class="accented">qorban</span>) <span class="accented">to</span> pass away, and they shall hang up the abomination in the temple." The Vulgate rendering is in accordance generally with the Massoretic, "And arms shall stand from him. and shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall remove the continual (<span class="accented">juge</span>) sacrifice, and shall place the abomination of desolation." <span class="accented">Arms shall stand on his part.</span> This word "arms" here is not to be understood as weapons - a misunderstanding possible in English. "Arms" here stands as the symbol of physical power generally. "On his part" is represented by the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>, which means "with" or "from;" hence we find the Septuagint translating by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>, and Theodotion by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span>. Probably the most natural view is to take the preposition as equivalent to "by," that is, he shall set physical forces in motion. <span class="accented">And they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength.</span> That the temple in Jerusalem had all the characteristics that fitted it to become a fortress, was proved in every one of the numerous sieges it has endured. It becomes still more a fortress, of course, when the Tower Antonia was erected overlooking the temple area. There may, however, have been a reference to the fact that the collectors of tribute sent by Antiochus fortified the city of David, and used it as a basis of operations from which to assail the temple and defile its courts with blood (1 Macc. 1:35-36). <span class="accented">And take away the daily sacrifice.</span> The Hebrew word here used means "continual," and the substantive "sacrifice" is supplied. In ver. 45 of the same chapter of 1 Macc. we are told that Antiochus forbade "burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and drink offerings in the temple." <span class="accented">And they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.</span> One must note here the source of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span> which we find in both Greek versions, and <span class="accented">dabit</span>, which we find in the Vulgate. The Hebrew has <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">venath'noo</span>), "and they shall <span class="accented">give</span> or set." It seems to refer to an altar to Jupiter, which was erected on the brazen altar (1 Macc. 1:59). This altar is spoken of in ver. 54 as the "abomination of desolation (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)." The Hebrew phrase has been borrowed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>; hence the suggestion of Professor Bevan, to read here "<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;</span>, is not necessary <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:31-45 The remainder of this prophecy is very difficult, and commentators differ much respecting it. From Antiochus the account seems to pass to antichrist. Reference seems to be made to the Roman empire, the fourth monarchy, in its pagan, early Christian, and papal states. The end of the Lord's anger against his people approaches, as well as the end of his patience towards his enemies. If we would escape the ruin of the infidel, the idolater, the superstitious and cruel persecutor, as well as that of the profane, let us make the oracles of God our standard of truth and of duty, the foundation of our hope, and the light of our paths through this dark world, to the glorious inheritance above.</body></html>
