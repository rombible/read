The word translated "treasures" is a late one, but evidently the Septuagint translator had <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e7;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">maqom</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>. (<span class="accented">michemanay</span>). Theodotion renders, "And he shall have power over the secret hoards of gold and silver, and over all the desirable things of Egypt, and of Libyans, and of AEthiopians in their fortresses." Theodotion has read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">metzorayo</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">mitz'adoyo</span>). The Peshitta rendering is, "And he shall have power over the house of the treasures of gold and silver, and of the pleasant things of Egypt, and the Libyans, and the Cushites (Ethiopians) are his allies." The Vulgate follows a slightly different rendering, "And he shall rule the treasures of gold and silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; through Libya and AEthiopia, too, shall he pass." Having a different reading in the last clause from the Massoretic, the natural Hebrew equivalent for <span class="accented">transibit</span> is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">ya'bor</span>) - <span class="accented">a</span> word that could scarcelv arise by mistake from that in the text. <span class="accented">He</span> <span class="accented">shall have power over the treasures of gold and silcer</span>, <span class="accented">and over all the precious things of Egypt.</span> Strictly speaking, this never was the case, as Antiochus never wholly conquered Egypt, although in that expedition, in which he had laid siege to Alexandria, he came very near completing his conquest. <span class="accented">And the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall beat his steps.</span> This certainly is not true in the sense in which Jerome takes it, "he shall pass through Libya and Ethiopia." Though Antiochus more than once invaded Egypt, he never passed further into Africa. These nationalities are associated with each other; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-8.htm">Jeremiah 46:8, 9</a>, we have, "The Ethiopians and the Libyans that handle the shield." So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a> we have the countries spoken of together. It may merely mean that individuals belonging to these nationalities had joined his armies. This is altogether a more ornate and poetical passage than the rest of this chapter, and gives the feeling of a different hand; therefore, probably, it belongs to a time nearer that of Daniel, and contains more of the original prophecy. Professor Fuller remarks on a reference being made to the help Ptolemy received from Cyprus. Cyprus, or Chittim, is referred to in the earlier part of this chapter, but not here. The Lubim and Cushim are contemporary with Edom, Moab, and the sons of Ammon. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:31-45 The remainder of this prophecy is very difficult, and commentators differ much respecting it. From Antiochus the account seems to pass to antichrist. Reference seems to be made to the Roman empire, the fourth monarchy, in its pagan, early Christian, and papal states. The end of the Lord's anger against his people approaches, as well as the end of his patience towards his enemies. If we would escape the ruin of the infidel, the idolater, the superstitious and cruel persecutor, as well as that of the profane, let us make the oracles of God our standard of truth and of duty, the foundation of our hope, and the light of our paths through this dark world, to the glorious inheritance above.</body></html>
