The first words of this belong to the previous verse, and at the same time there has been some confusion with the opening words of the present verse according to the Massoretic division. Theodotion is not much closer to the received text, "And he shall act in strongholds of refuge with a strange god, and shall increase glory, and subject many to them, and shall divide the land in gifts." The sense of this last, as given in the Greek versions, is illustrated by <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-4.htm">Psalm 16:4</a>. The Peshitta renders, "He shall pass over to the strong cities, on account of ('<span class="accented">al</span>) the strange gods which he shall see, and he shall rule over many, and the land he shall divide for gain" The Vulgate renders more in accordance with Theodotion than with the Massoretic yet independently, "And he shall do (<span class="accented">faciet</span>) that he may fortify <span class="accented">Maozim</span> with a foreign god, whom he knew not, and shall multiply glory, and shall give to them power in many (things), and shall divide the land gratuitously" This verse as it stands is nearly unintelligible. The suggestion of Hitzig and yon Lengerke, followed by Bevan, that we should read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> ('am), "people," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">eem</span>), "with," is very plausible. The only objection is that none of the versions have it. As, however, it seems to us the only way out of the difficulty, we shall take this reading, and render, with Professor Bevan, "He shall procure for the strong fortresses the people of a strange god." For this use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d4;</span> Professor Bevan refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1</a>, "Absalom procured for himself chariot and horses;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5</a>, so of Adonijah. <span class="accented">Whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory.</span> This we should render, "who have acknowledged him," making the antecedent to the relative, not the king, but "the people of the strange god;" the reference being to the mercenaries of the Syrian army, who were the people of a god strange to the Israelites, and not impossibly made less difficulty in giving up their national gods, and recognizing the gods of Greece as their gods. The K'thib here is the preterite instead of the imperfect, which occurs in the following clause, the reading which we accept here. <span class="accented">He shall increase with glory</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">he shall multiply in glory.</span> These mercenaries of his he would increase, and give ever more honour to them. <span class="accented">And he shall cause them to rule over many</span>. These mercenaries placed in fenced cities were formed into Hellenic communities, and received many of the natives as subjects. The reference is not merely to garrisons being placed in fortresses, but to a chain of Hellenic cities, which, in imitation of the Romans, Antiochus placed in Palestine. <span class="accented">And shall divide the land for gain.</span> As will be seen, the Greek versions and the Vulgate reverse the idea here, and render - the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, "<span class="accented">gratuitously</span>;" Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "in gifts;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">gratuito</span>, which is due to reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">meheer</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">meheer</span>). The word may mean, as it is taken by the English versions and the Peshitta to mean, "for a price;" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>, David purchased the threshing-floor of Araunah <span class="accented">bimeheer</span>, "<span class="accented">at</span> a price;" but it also means "<span class="accented">wages</span>," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>, "Her priests teach for hire wages (<span class="accented">bimeheer</span>)." The reference, then, is to the fact that in the deplenished state of his treasury, Antiochus divided the land of Palestine to his mercenaries, in lieu of the wages he could not pay. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:31-45 The remainder of this prophecy is very difficult, and commentators differ much respecting it. From Antiochus the account seems to pass to antichrist. Reference seems to be made to the Roman empire, the fourth monarchy, in its pagan, early Christian, and papal states. The end of the Lord's anger against his people approaches, as well as the end of his patience towards his enemies. If we would escape the ruin of the infidel, the idolater, the superstitious and cruel persecutor, as well as that of the profane, let us make the oracles of God our standard of truth and of duty, the foundation of our hope, and the light of our paths through this dark world, to the glorious inheritance above.</body></html>
