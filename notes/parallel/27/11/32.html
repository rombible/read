The <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;</span>, the preformative of the participle hiphil, has been taken for the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>. written defectively, and probably <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span>. Theodotion does not require special notice, as his version here agrees closely with the Massoretic. The Peshitta is somewhat shorter and having a different significance, "And those who transgress against the covenant he shall condemn them. And the people who know the fear shall be strong." The Vulgate rendering is, "And the impious against the covenant shall feign falsely (<span class="accented">simulabunt fraudu-lenter</span>), but the people knowing their God shall possess and do (exploits)." Men like Alcimus, the high priest after Menelaus, were transgressors of the sacred covenant, and were corrupted by the flatteries of Epiphanes. He used them to gain the people over to his views. <span class="accented">But the people that do know their God shall be strong</span>, <span class="accented">and do exploits.</span> Even when Epiphanes seemed most nearly successful, there was a deep-seated opposition to this Hellenizing process. Especially prominent were those who were zealous for the Law, the <span class="accented">Hasidim</span>, or, to give them the name they have in the Book of Maccabees, the Assidseans. These religionists, headed by Mattathias and his sons, especially by the heroic Judas Maccabaeus, certainly knew their God, and as certainly did exploits. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:31-45 The remainder of this prophecy is very difficult, and commentators differ much respecting it. From Antiochus the account seems to pass to antichrist. Reference seems to be made to the Roman empire, the fourth monarchy, in its pagan, early Christian, and papal states. The end of the Lord's anger against his people approaches, as well as the end of his patience towards his enemies. If we would escape the ruin of the infidel, the idolater, the superstitious and cruel persecutor, as well as that of the profane, let us make the oracles of God our standard of truth and of duty, the foundation of our hope, and the light of our paths through this dark world, to the glorious inheritance above.</body></html>
