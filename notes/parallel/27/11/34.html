(See last Note). These will not be entirely without help, but there will be some small assistance given them. It will be small, either compared with their present needs, or contrasted with the great help which will be given them when the tribulation attains its greatest severity. In the Maccabee persecutions help was given to the sufferers by Judas and his brethren (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/3-11.htm" title="Which thing when Judas perceived, he went forth to meet him, and so he smote him, and slew him: many also fell down slain, but the rest fled.">1 Maccabees 3:11</a>, &c., <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/4-14.htm" title="So they joined battle, and the heathen being discomfited fled into the plain.">1 Maccabees 4:14</a>, &c.). This prevented the faithful from disappearing entirely.<p><span class= "bld">Many shall cleave. . . .</span>--Dissimulation will cause some to declare themselves upon the side of "those that understand." This is a feature which will be noticed in religious persecutions; according as one party or the other gains in power, as its prospects brighten, it gains fresh adherents. This held true in the days of Antiochus. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/6-21.htm" title="Howbeit certain of them that were besieged got forth, unto whom some ungodly men of Israel joined themselves:">1 Maccabees 6:21</a>, &c., 9:23.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.</span> The Septuagint rendering is, "And when they are crushed many shall be gathered to them in (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>) the city, even many as in distribution by lot (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>)." This phrase is rendered by Paulus Tellensis (<span class="accented">poolog pesa</span>), "the division of the lots;" wrongly rendered by Bugati, <span class="accented">in hereditate.</span> The reading here is due to dropping of the reduplication in <span class="accented">heltqluqoth.</span> The Peshitta generally agrees with the Massoretic, only it renders the last clause, "Many shall add themselves to them in division, (<span class="accented">palgootha</span>)," which, however, Castelli renders in this one case as <span class="accented">simulatio.</span> When success crowned the arms of Judas and his brethren, many of the Sadducean party joined themselves to them, although formerly they belonged to the Hellenizers. This association rendered the Assidaeans dissatisfied, and resulted in disaster. Probably the reference is to nothing so far down history. When Judas began to be successful, many would join him, hoping, by a limited amount of treachery to Judas, to secure safety if the king ultimately prevailed, while at the same time, their presence with the Maccabees would save them from the vengeance of their own countrymen if Judas were successful and the Syrian yoke thrown off. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:31-45 The remainder of this prophecy is very difficult, and commentators differ much respecting it. From Antiochus the account seems to pass to antichrist. Reference seems to be made to the Roman empire, the fourth monarchy, in its pagan, early Christian, and papal states. The end of the Lord's anger against his people approaches, as well as the end of his patience towards his enemies. If we would escape the ruin of the infidel, the idolater, the superstitious and cruel persecutor, as well as that of the profane, let us make the oracles of God our standard of truth and of duty, the foundation of our hope, and the light of our paths through this dark world, to the glorious inheritance above.</body></html>
