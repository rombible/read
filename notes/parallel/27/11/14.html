and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.">Daniel 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/10-7.htm" title="And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell on them, so that they fled to hide themselves.">Daniel 10:7-8</a>)--we appear to be approaching the great crisis. We appear to be within "a very few days" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-20.htm" title="Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.">Daniel 11:20</a>) of the vile-person who corresponds to the little horn of the fourth beast. At this period the king of the south suffers from many hostile opponents, while certain others, more closely connected with the Jews, become prominent for a while, but then fail. The obscurity of the Hebrew text was felt by the LXX., and distinct historical allusions can be found by those only who are determined to find them. These are stated to be some insurrections during the early years of Ptolemy Epiphanes, and a league which some of the Jews made with Antiochus the Great against Ptolemy.<p><span class= "bld">Robbers of thy people.--</span>This difficult expression occurs only in five other passages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-4.htm" title="Concerning the works of men, by the word of your lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.">Psalm 17:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-9.htm" title="No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there:">Isaiah 35:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-11.htm" title="Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-22.htm" title="My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.">Ezekiel 7:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-10.htm" title="If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that does the like to any one of these things,">Ezekiel 18:10</a>). The words in this passage can only refer to certain Jews who committed various violent breaches of the Law, and on this occasion revolted against the king of the south.<p><span class= "bld">To establish the vision.--</span>The meaning is, the result of their acts is to bring about the accomplishment of the vision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-14.htm" title="Now I am come to make you understand what shall befall your people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.">Daniel 10:14</a>). The significant part of the verse is the "falling" of the robbers. It seems to mean that the conduct of these men shall bring them just the reverse of what they had expected.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall</span>. The versions here differ from this, which represents the Massoretic with fair accuracy. The LXX. renders, "And in those times thoughts (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) shall rise against the King of Egypt, and he shall build again that which has fallen down of thy people " - reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">oobanah</span>), "and he shall build," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">oobenee</span>), "and sons of;" he has read also <span class="accented">peratzee</span>, "breaches," instead of <span class="accented">peritzee</span>, "robbers," - "and he shall raise himself up" - reading singular instead of plural - "to fulfil the prophecy, and they shall stumble." This confusion indicates that the reading of the LXX. is mistaken. Theodotion is as much removed from the Massoretic as is the above, "And in those times many shall rise against the king of the south, and the sons of the plagues (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) of thy people shall be exalted to establish the vision, and they shall become weak." If there were any trace of uncertainty in the reading at this point, we might be tempted to read <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, written <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x397;&#x399;&#x39e;&#x3a4;&#x3a9;&#x39d;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x39f;&#x399;&#x39c;&#x3a9;&#x39d;</span>. The reading of Nestle (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) is no improvement. The Peshitta renders, "And many shall rise against the king of the north, and the sons of the perversity of thy people shall be raised up to fulfil the vision, and shall be cast down." The change from "king of the south" to "the king of the north" must be noted, probably simply the result of blunder. The Vulgate renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e8;&#x5e6;&#x5d9;</span> <span class="accented">pre-varieatorum</span>, <span class="accented">And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south.</span> Ptolemy Epiphanes was not only exposed to the assault of the confederates Antiochus and Philip of Macedon; but there were intrigues and conspiracies in the palace. <span class="accented">Also</span> <span class="accented">the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the sons of the oppressors.</span> Commentators of all varieties have assumed that these are Jews. Hitzig maintains that they were the Jews that sided with Antiochus's rule ('Historical Exposition of Daniel'); that they were the separatists, those who had gone down to Egypt (Calvin; Behrmann, 'Die Stiirmische Jugend'); Keil, "violent men who break through Divine law." So Kranichfeld and Wordsworth. Stuart, "the violent of thy people;" Ewald, "young high-handed men." Fuller thinks the word <span class="accented">prizzeem</span> is used as "rulers." Griitz would render, "to establish the vision, to make the law to totter " - an attempt to get, by addition to the text, an explanation. The Hebrew text does not bear out this meaning. Gratz here implies <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d6;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">hazion</span>), "vision," to be equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">torah</span>), "law;" but this is never the case. But the oppressors of the people do not necessarily belong to it. <span class="accented">To establish the vision</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-28.htm">Acts 4:28</a>). It may be that here there is a portion of the original vision of Daniel, which has been overlaid with what we have before us. It is a summary of the whole history of the Jews under the Greek domination. <span class="accented">But they shall fall.</span> A general statement true of all the oppressors of Israel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-30 The angel shows Daniel the succession of the Persian and Grecian empires. The kings of Egypt and Syria are noticed: Judea was between their dominions, and affected by their contests. From ver. 5-30, is generally considered to relate to the events which came to pass during the continuance of these governments; and from ver. 21, to relate to Antiochus Epiphanes, who was a cruel and violent persecutor of the Jews. See what decaying, perishing things worldly pomp and possessions are, and the power by which they are gotten. God, in his providence, sets up one, and pulls down another, as he pleases. This world is full of wars and fightings, which come from men's lusts. All changes and revolutions of states and kingdoms, and every event, are plainly and perfectly foreseen by God. No word of God shall fall to the ground; but what he has designed, what he has declared, shall infallibly come to pass. While the potsherds of the earth strive with each other, they prevail and are prevailed against, deceive and are deceived; but those who know God will trust in him, and he will enable them to stand their ground, bear their cross, and maintain their conflict.</body></html>
