There seems to be a difference of reading in the first clause. Instead of <span class="accented">yazheeroo kezohar</span>, there seems to have been <span class="accented">yayraro kim'ooroth.</span> The verb used in the Massoretic text means really "admonish." The noun occurs only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-2.htm">Ezekiel 13:2</a>. In the last clause, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">harabbeem</span>), "many," the Septuagint has read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">deboray</span>), "my words." It is difficult to account for the omission of the final <span class="hebrew">&#x20;&#x5dd;</span> <span class="accented">unless</span> from the likeness of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;</span> to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;</span> and and (see Corpus Insc. Semit.). Theodotion renders, "And they that understand shall shine as the <span class="accented">brightness</span> of the firmament, and certain from amongst the righteous as the stars for ever and ever." The Peshitta rendering is somewhat paraphrastic, "Those that do good and are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and those who conquer many shall be lights, and arise as the stars of heaven for ever and ever." The Vulgate is in close harmony with the Massoretic text. The versions are superior to our Authorized, in having "those that understand" instead of "those that be wise." Bevan regards the wise here as the "teachers." There seems, however, no reason for such a restriction. The reading of the Septuagint in the opening clause of the second member of the sentence is inferior, as confirming or justifying the words of Daniel or of God is a simpler idea than that of turning many to righteousness. Further, there is a difficulty of fixing who is referred to by the prenominal suffix "my." Professor Fuller refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-11.htm">Isaiah 51:11</a> for a parallel use of the hiphil of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>; but there, as elsewhere, it means, not "turn to righteousness," but "justify," that is, "declare righteous." Yet the connection between the two ideas is close, and the forensic idea can have no place here. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-43.htm">Matthew 13:43</a> represents a similar reward to the righteous. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-4. Michael signifies, Who is like God, and his name, with the title of the great Prince, points out the Divine Saviour. Christ stood for the children of our people in their stead as a sacrifice, bore the curse for them, to bear it from them. He stands for them in pleading for them at the throne of grace. And after the destruction of antichrist, the Lord Jesus shall stand at the latter day upon the earth; and He shall appear for the complete redemption of all his people. When God works deliverance from persecution for them, it is as life from the dead. When his gospel is preached, many who sleep in the dust, both Jews and Gentiles, shall be awakened by it out of their heathenism of Judaism. And in the end the multitude that sleep in the dust shall awake; many shall arise to life, and many to shame. There is glory reserved for all the saints in the future state, for all that are wise, wise for their souls and eternity. Those who turn many to righteousness, who turn sinners from the errors of their ways, and help to save their souls from death, Jas 5:20, will share in the glory of those they have helped to heaven, which will add to their own glory.</body></html>
