For the reason of the choice of this word, see the next Note.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the bank of the river.</span> The versions do not require remark, save that the Septuagint and the Peshitta do not repeat "river." The abrupt introduction of "two other' is another proof that the long eleventh chapter, as we have it now, is an interpolation. We must go back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-18.htm">Daniel 10:18</a> to get the person from whom these two mentioned are distinguished. The two new <span class="accented">dramatis personae</span> are, as Professor Bevan remarks, in all likelihood angels, and the river in question is the Tigris. In ch. 10. Hiddekel is <span class="accented">nahar</span>; here the word used is <span class="accented">yeor</span>, a word very often used of the Nile, but not exclusively (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-21.htm">Isaiah 33:21</a>). Hitzig asserts that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">y'or</span>) is an Egyptian appellative, made by the Hebrews into the proper name of the Nile. The example just given disproves this statement, and from this false premise he deduces that the Book of Daniel was written in Egypt. They may be angels of countries. There seems nothing to justify the idea that Michael and Gabriel are the two here intended - the word "other" excludes this. The reason of this introduction of two angels is, Professor Bevan thinks, as witnesses to the oath of the angel. But an oath, to be binding, did not need witnesses; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> when David sware to Jonathan, there were no witnesses. Another idea may be hazarded - the Tigris may be looked upon as the boundary of the East and the West; and the two other angels may be the angelic guardians of these two regions. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:5-13 One of the angels asking how long it should be to the end of these wonders, a solemn reply is made, that it would be for a time, times, and a half, the period mentioned ch. 7:25, and in the Revelation. It signifies 1260 prophetic days or years, beginning from the time when the power of the holy people should be scattered. The imposture of Mohammed, and the papal usurpation, began about the same time; and these were a twofold attack upon the church of God. But all will end well at last. All opposing rule, principality, and power, shall be put down, and holiness and love will triumph, and be in honour, to eternity. The end, this end, shall come. What an amazing prophecy is this, of so many varied events, and extending through so many successive ages, even to the general resurrection! Daniel must comfort himself with the pleasing prospect of his own happiness in death, in judgment, and to eternity. It is good for us all to think much of going away from this world. That must be our way; but it is our comfort that we shall not go till God calls us to another world, and till he has done with us in this world; till he says, Go thou thy way, thou hast done thy work, therefore now, go thy way, and leave it to others to take thy place. It was a comfort to Daniel, and is a comfort to all the saints, that whatever their lot is in the days of their lives, they shall have a happy lot in the end of the days. And it ought to be the great care and concern of every one of us to secure this. Then we may well be content with our present lot, and welcome the will of God. Believers are happy at all times; they rest in God by faith now, and a rest is reserved for them in heaven at last.</body></html>
