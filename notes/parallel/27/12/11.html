The language used respecting the "abomination" is almost verbally the same as that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-3.htm" title="Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.">Daniel 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-11.htm" title="Yes, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of the sanctuary was cast down.">Daniel 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-27.htm" title="And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the middle of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured on the desolate.">Daniel 9:27</a>, and prevents us from arriving at any other conclusion. The great and apparently insoluble difficulty is the relation which the 1,290 or the 1,335 days occupy with regard to the 2,300 days, or the time, times, and the dividing of a time. Assuming that these four periods all commence at the same epoch (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-14.htm" title="And he said to me, To two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.">Daniel 8:14</a>), the death of Antiochus closes the 1,290 days, and the 1,335 days point to some event which occurred forty-five days, or a month and a half, later. The principal objection to this view is that the exact date of the death of Antiochus is uncertain, and therefore all calculations based upon the precise day of his death must be untrustworthy. It is obvious that neither of the two periods mentioned in this and the following verse can be made to agree with three years and a half without setting the rules of arithmetic at defiance. Also the obscurity which rests over the greater portion of the history of Israel should guard us against assuming that we can explain all the contents of the last three chapters by means of what occurred in those times, and also against assuming our historical facts from Daniel, and then making use of them to illustrate his prophecies.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days</span>. The Septuagint is, "From <span class="cmt_word">the</span> time the sacrifice is taken away for ever, and the abomination of desolation is prepared to be set up, are a thousand two hundred and ninety days." The translator must have had <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> ('<span class="accented">olath</span>) before him, and read it <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> ('<span class="accented">olah</span>), else he could not have translated <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bb;&#x5d3;</span> "for ever," and written "sacrifice" also. The Hebrew copyist, following the usage of Palestine, which makes "sacrifice" understood after "continual," had omitted it in the text followed by the Massoretes. Theodotion's rendering is, "From the time of the change of the daily sacrifice (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) and the abomination of desolation set up ("given," <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) is a thousand two hundred and ninety days." The Peshitta and Vulgate do not call for remarks. This verse is a veritable cruz <span class="accented">interpretum. From the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away.</span> This event is referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-31.htm">Daniel 11:31</a>. Whether the eleventh chapter is earlier or later is in our opinion scarcely doubtful. Also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-11.htm">Daniel 8:11</a> we have the taking away of the daily sacrifice mentioned as one of the deeds of Antiochus. While the reference in ch. 11. and ch. 8. is to the action of Antiochus, it is not necessary to maintain that this refers to him; other oppressors might take away the daily sacrifice. This clause certainly seems to give the <span class="accented">terminus a quo</span>, but it is difficult to fix the date in question. Certainly from the fact that the words used here are used by the writer of the eleventh chapter to describe the actions of Antiochus, and that in 1 Macc. 1:54 there is also a similar identification, we might be inclined to take the event here mentioned as the starting-point of the twelve hundred and ninety days. But the acknowledged impossibility of fitting the days to the chronology militates against this view. <span class="accented">And the abomination that maketh desolate set up.</span> At first sight the reader is inclined to follow Wieseler, and regard this as a statement of the <span class="accented">terminus ad quem.</span> The grammatical difficulties against this view are forcible. Although <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span>... <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>, "from" and "to," are sometimes used for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d3;</span> ... <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>, "from... until," it is rare, and the intrusion of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;</span>, "and," is strong against this interpretation. Yet it seems strange that two <span class="accented">termini a quo</span> should be assigned and no ter<span class="accented">minus ad quota. A thousand two hundred and ninety days.</span> While this seems to be the same period as that reckoned in the seventh verse, "a time, times, and half a time," yet it is not absolutely coincident. It is thirty days more than three and a half times the prophetic year of three hundred and sixty, and eleven days more than three and a half mean solar years. As we have already said, if we take the profanation of the temple, 25th Casleu, 145 Seleucid era, as our starting-point, it is impossible to fix any great deliverance or any event of importance which happened some three years and seven months after. Antiochus may have died seven months after the news arrived of the reconsecration of the temple; but we have no data. As above stated, the death of Antiochus wrought but little alteration in the condition of the Jews. If we regard the days as literal days, there is one period that nearly coincides with the twelve hundred and ninety days - our Lord's ministry upon the earth. It is difficult to understand how our Lord's commencing his ministry was the removing of the daily sacrifice. Yet in the "heavenlies" it might be so. Further, we sometimes reckon "from" a period to come, as we can say, "We are yet - weeks from harvest, midsummer, or Christmas." So the Crucifixion as the fulfilment of all the sacrifices of the Law may be regarded as their removal. Certainly in his crucifixion was the real abomination which maketh desolate set up. It suits the next verse. From our Lord's crucifixion to his ascension there would be exactly forty-five days if, as is commonly believed, his ascension, as his resurrection, took place on a Sunday. This, however, is merely a thought thrown out. If we take the date indicated by our Lord, the war against the Jews, dating from Vespasian's march to Ptolemais in the beginning of A.D. to the capture of the temple and the cessation of the daily sacrifice (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 6:02. 1), is not far off twelve hundred and ninety days. From this to the final capture of the city is close upon forty-five days. If we, however, take a day for a year, then another series of possible solutions are before us, all more or less faulty. One has the merit of postponing the solution to a date still future. The capture of Jerusalem by the Arabs in A.D. is made the starting-point; if we add to that twelve hundred and ninety years, we have A.D. . The Mohammedan power may have fallen by that time; anything may have happened then. All these various solutions, all more or less unsatisfactory, prove that no solution is possible. If the fulfilment is yet in the future, circumstances may convey to us the interpretation. We must remember the vision was sealed to "the time of the end." Professor Fuller suggests that Babylonian discovery may at some future date throw light on Daniel's use of numbers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:5-13 One of the angels asking how long it should be to the end of these wonders, a solemn reply is made, that it would be for a time, times, and a half, the period mentioned ch. 7:25, and in the Revelation. It signifies 1260 prophetic days or years, beginning from the time when the power of the holy people should be scattered. The imposture of Mohammed, and the papal usurpation, began about the same time; and these were a twofold attack upon the church of God. But all will end well at last. All opposing rule, principality, and power, shall be put down, and holiness and love will triumph, and be in honour, to eternity. The end, this end, shall come. What an amazing prophecy is this, of so many varied events, and extending through so many successive ages, even to the general resurrection! Daniel must comfort himself with the pleasing prospect of his own happiness in death, in judgment, and to eternity. It is good for us all to think much of going away from this world. That must be our way; but it is our comfort that we shall not go till God calls us to another world, and till he has done with us in this world; till he says, Go thou thy way, thou hast done thy work, therefore now, go thy way, and leave it to others to take thy place. It was a comfort to Daniel, and is a comfort to all the saints, that whatever their lot is in the days of their lives, they shall have a happy lot in the end of the days. And it ought to be the great care and concern of every one of us to secure this. Then we may well be content with our present lot, and welcome the will of God. Believers are happy at all times; they rest in God by faith now, and a rest is reserved for them in heaven at last.</body></html>
