Some difficulty is presented by the use of the word "many" where "all" would have been expected. Theodoret explains it from <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-15.htm" title="But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded to many.">Romans 5:15</a>, where he observes "many" stands for "all." It is, however, more in accordance with the language to suppose that by the word "many" some contrast is implied, which is apparently between the <span class= "ital">many</span> who sleep in the dust and the comparatively small number of those who "are alive and remain." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-28.htm" title="Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,">John 5:28</a>, &c.)

For the use of the word "shame," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-40.htm" title="And I will bring an everlasting reproach on you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.">Jeremiah 23:40</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.</span> The Septuagint rendering is, "And many that sleep in the breadth (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) of the earth shall arise, some to life eternal, and some to reproach, some to dispersion (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span>) and eternal shame." These terms, "reproach" and "dispersion," are different attempts to render <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">haraphoth</span>), "reproaches." The differences between the above and Theodotion are merely verbal; "dispersion" is omitted, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, "dust," is instead of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, The rendering of the Peshitta is, "And many of those that sleep in the dust shall awake, some to life everlasting, and some to destruction and contempt of their friends for ever." The Vulgate has a somewhat singular version of the last clause, "And many that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to life eternal, and some to contempt, in order that they may always see it (<span class="accented">ut videant semper</span>)." <span class="accented">Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth.</span> Sleep, as a symbol of death, is frequent, both in the Old Testament and the New: <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-3.htm">Psalm 13:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-13.htm">Job 3:13</a>; for the New Testament, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-60.htm">Acts 7:60</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>. "Dust" is a common phrase for the grave: <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-21.htm">Job 7:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-30.htm">Psalm 22:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-10.htm">Psalm 30:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>. The reference here is to those who are not only dead, but buried. The phrase translated, "dust of the earth," literally means "earth of dust." The phrase is so singular that Professor Robertson Smith has suggested that instead of reading '<span class="accented">admath</span> '<span class="accented">aphar</span>, we should read '<span class="accented">armath</span> '<span class="accented">aphar</span> - <span class="accented">aram in</span> Arabic meaning a "cairn" or "mound." There is, however, as Professor Bevan remarks, no instance in Hebrew or Aramaic of such a word being in use. It is assumed that the reference here (Behrmann, etc.) is to the Jews alone; but for this assumption there is no justification. While, on the one hand, one cannot prove from this that others besides Israel shall partake in the resurrection; on the other, as little can we assert that "the Jews," at the period when this verse was written, excluded all but Jews. We cannot deduce that" many" here excludes "all." The idea suggested is rather multitudinousness. <span class="accented">Shall awake</span>, <span class="accented">sores to everlasting life</span>, <span class="accented">and some to shame and everlasting contempt.</span> This is a distinct reference to the resurrection of the body; it is those that "sleep in the dust" that shall thus "awake." It is to be noted that at the resurrection the condition of each is fixed frailly - it is to "everlasting life" and "over-lasting contempt" This resurrection is individual, not national, as shown by the contrasted fates. The doctrine of the resurrection is thus clearly stated. There is no need to examine how much the Jews of the time of the Maccabees understood of this doctrine. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-14.htm">Isaiah 26:14-19</a>, as clearly as does this passage, proclaims the same belief. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-1.htm">Ezekiel 37:1-14</a> shows that resurrection was to the Israelites not such an incongruous or impossible idea as it was to the Greeks. But when is this? We might be led by the juxtaposition of this to the account of the sufferings of the Jews under Antiochus, to think that the writer believed the end of the world would take place immediately on the fall of Antiochus. But in the first place we must remember that we have not the vision given to Daniel; it has been replaced by the eleventh chapter. Further, the method of prophecy must be borne in mind. The future was made known in vision. If, as seems probable, distance in space from the apparent standpoint of the prophet represented distance in time from his actual or assumed chronological position, then, if the description of the vision proceeded from one side of the picture to the other, those things would be in close juxtaposition which were to be far removed from each other chronologically. Thus an astronomer may place in the same constellation stars inconceivably distant from each other - nay, may even unite as one binary star two suns, the one nearer the earth than the other by thousands of millions of miles. So our Lord correlates the destruction of Jerusalem with the end of the world. Moreover, the misery endured by the Jewish saints under Antiochus was a type of the sufferings of the people of God of every age. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-4. Michael signifies, Who is like God, and his name, with the title of the great Prince, points out the Divine Saviour. Christ stood for the children of our people in their stead as a sacrifice, bore the curse for them, to bear it from them. He stands for them in pleading for them at the throne of grace. And after the destruction of antichrist, the Lord Jesus shall stand at the latter day upon the earth; and He shall appear for the complete redemption of all his people. When God works deliverance from persecution for them, it is as life from the dead. When his gospel is preached, many who sleep in the dust, both Jews and Gentiles, shall be awakened by it out of their heathenism of Judaism. And in the end the multitude that sleep in the dust shall awake; many shall arise to life, and many to shame. There is glory reserved for all the saints in the future state, for all that are wise, wise for their souls and eternity. Those who turn many to righteousness, who turn sinners from the errors of their ways, and help to save their souls from death, Jas 5:20, will share in the glory of those they have helped to heaven, which will add to their own glory.</body></html>
