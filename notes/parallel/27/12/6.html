But at the same time, the remarkable word used for "river" recalls the Nile, and seems to be employed for the purpose of assuring the readers of the book that "He who smote the waters of the Nile" will restrain all earthly powers which war against His people.<p><span class= "bld">How long</span> . . . <span class= "bld">end.</span>--The end is that which has been frequently spoken of (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-40.htm" title="And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.">Daniel 11:40</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-3.htm" title="And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.">Daniel 12:3</a>). The question asks, "How long will the end of these wonders continue? The end always appears to be at hand, yet it never comes. How long will this continue?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?</span> The Septuagint renderingis, "And I said" - reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5e8;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5e8;</span> - "to one clothed in fair linen (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>), which is above the water of the river" - the last five words being omitted from the Syriac of Paulus Tellensis - "When, then, shall the end be of these marvels which thou hast told me, and their purification?" The last clause, which does not represent anything in the Massoretic, is due to a confusion between <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, with which the next verse begins, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>. Theodotion's rendering is, as usual, closer to the Massoretic, "and he said to the man clothed in <span class="accented">baddin</span>, who was upon the waters of the river, When shall be the end of those marvels of which thou speakest?" Both the Greek versions insert "of which thou speakest." The rendering of the Peshitta differs slightly, "And they said" - a reading that one would be wishful to adopt if it had any probability in its favour - "to the man clothed in beautiful apparel, who was standing above the waters of the river, Until when shall the end of these things be?" The omission of "wonders" is to be observed. The Vulgate follows the Septuagint in making Daniel the speaker, "And I said to the man clothed in linen, who was standing over the waters of the river, When shall be the end of these marvels?" <span class="accented">And one said.</span> Aben Ezra makes this one of the two who spoke. This suggestion is the most natural, only the sentence is singularly abrupt, and favours the idea that there is an omission here. The LXX. and Vulgate, as we have seen, read, "I <span class="accented">said."</span> While the reading is an easy one, it is, as Professor Bevan remarks, against the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-13.htm">Daniel 8:13</a>. <span class="accented">To the man clothed in linen.</span> This man is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>, presumably Gabriel. <span class="accented">Which was upon the waters of the river.</span> The reference may be to <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16</a>, where a voice comes to him from between the banks of the river Ulai. Here, not upon the waters of the river Tigris, but over them, was the appearance of the angel Gabriel. <span class="accented">How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?</span> One difficulty that strikes one is that there are no wonders foretold. That the rulers of Syria should war against the possessors of Egypt was not a marvellous thing. Professor Bevan, who holds that the marvels referred to are the events foretold, quotes <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-14.htm">Isaiah 29:14</a> as a parallel instance, but, though marvels are there mentioned, such marvels that all the wisdom of the wise should fail, etc., yet here nothing is told of the nature of these marvels. Had there been visions of symbolic animals, as in the seventh and eighth chapters, we could have understood these things being spoken of as marvels. The probability, then, is heightened that there have been omissions as well as insertions here. The time contemplated is the end, when judgment and resurrection are passed. It is, in fact, the question of the apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a>), "Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?" <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:5-13 One of the angels asking how long it should be to the end of these wonders, a solemn reply is made, that it would be for a time, times, and a half, the period mentioned ch. 7:25, and in the Revelation. It signifies 1260 prophetic days or years, beginning from the time when the power of the holy people should be scattered. The imposture of Mohammed, and the papal usurpation, began about the same time; and these were a twofold attack upon the church of God. But all will end well at last. All opposing rule, principality, and power, shall be put down, and holiness and love will triumph, and be in honour, to eternity. The end, this end, shall come. What an amazing prophecy is this, of so many varied events, and extending through so many successive ages, even to the general resurrection! Daniel must comfort himself with the pleasing prospect of his own happiness in death, in judgment, and to eternity. It is good for us all to think much of going away from this world. That must be our way; but it is our comfort that we shall not go till God calls us to another world, and till he has done with us in this world; till he says, Go thou thy way, thou hast done thy work, therefore now, go thy way, and leave it to others to take thy place. It was a comfort to Daniel, and is a comfort to all the saints, that whatever their lot is in the days of their lives, they shall have a happy lot in the end of the days. And it ought to be the great care and concern of every one of us to secure this. Then we may well be content with our present lot, and welcome the will of God. Believers are happy at all times; they rest in God by faith now, and a rest is reserved for them in heaven at last.</body></html>
