(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/24-6.htm" title="And you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that you be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.">Matthew 24:6-7</a>.) It should be observed that the mere presence of Michael does not avert the times of trouble. He helps God's people during the time of their trouble.

Theodotion's rendering is, "In that time shall stand up Michael, the great prince that standeth for the children of thy people, and it shall be a time of affliction such as there has not been since there was a nation upon the earth till that time: in that time shall thy people be saved, every one who is written in the book." The Peshitta rendering is, "At that time shall stand up Michael, the great angel who is overseer over the children of thy people, and it shall be a time of affliction such as has not been from the days of eternity; there shall be delivered of the children of thy people every one who is found written in the book." The rendering of the Vulgate is in close agreement with the Massoretic text. The difference in the first clause between the text of the Septuagint and that represented by the Massoretic text and that of the versions which follow it is of importance. It is hardly possible to suggest any Hebrew word for the place which can have been suggested by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>, the word used here for "time." Both versions of the clause look like attempts to supply a link of connection which was awanting in the text before them. This supports our idea that the eleventh chapter is mainly an interpolation. It would seem that the Septuagint translator had before him a text having some derivative possibly of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;</span>, perhaps in the passive of the pilpel, which has no extant example. <span class="accented">And at that time.</span> The connection would naturally imply the time of the destruction of the oppressor - the king of the south. When he was cut off "without a helper" would be a time one would expect of joy, not of affliction. It may refer to the coming of the oppressor from Egypt with "great rage." If that produced the great affliction, what is the result of Michael's standing up? It seems as if the connection here were hopelessly broken; some dislocation has occurred. <span class="accented">Michael the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a>). "Thy people," this pronominal suffix only occurs once in the previous chapter, in the fourteenth verse, in a clause that does not harmonize with the context - a clause that we think is a portion of the missing vision of Daniel. <span class="accented">Shall stand up.</span> This, taken in connection with his function, means he shall come for the help of Israel. <span class="accented">And there shall be a time of trouble</span>, <span class="accented">such as never was since there was a nation.</span> This is certainly not what might be expected to result from Michael arising for the deliverance of the people of God. It certainly may be intended to explain the fact that Michael does "stand up." But in the succeeding verses we have no account of special deliverance being given to Israel. The natural meaning of this would be that from the time that Israel began to be a nation there had not been such affliction. It might mean that never since there were nations had there been such a persecution. Father of these interpretations would be true. Never in the history of Israel had there been such a persecution, because the attempt to force the people to worship Jupiter was met by a far fiercer resistance than that which met Jezebel's attempt to make Israel worshippers of Baal. The people were not then so permeated with love and honour to Jehovah as they were now. Further, there was more kindred between Baal-worship and that of Jehovah originally than between the latter and the worship of Jupiter. Baal means simply" Lord," and Jehovah seems to have been worshipped under that title (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-16.htm">Hosea 2:16</a>). A collateral proof of this is the fact that Saul named one of his sons after "Baal" - Eshbaal (equivalent to Ishbosheth), <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-33.htm">1 Chronicles 8:33</a>; and Jonathan also named his son from Baal - Meribaal (equivalent to Mephibesheth), <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-34.htm">1 Chronicles 8:34</a>. The plea might thus be advanced that Baal-worship was a revival of an ancient cult. Hence the persecution, severe as it was, would not be so severe as tinder Antiochus. Yet, again, the Greek intellect, keen and polished as it was, could persecute in a way more thorough and complete. If fiercer persecution for religious views could not have been at any earlier time in Jewish history, in no other country would there have been any persecution at all, because there would have been no resist-ante to the will of the monarch. Our Lord, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>, has this passage in mind, and uses terms borrowed from it to describe the sufferings to be endured by the Jews at the hands of the Romans. when Jerusalem shall be besieged and taken. It is to be observed that while in Daniel the comparison is only with the past, in Matthew there is added a reference to the future, "No, nor ever shall be." Nothing, then, shall equal the appalling horrors of the siege and sack of Jerusalem. And <span class="accented">at that time thy people shall be delivered.</span> The mere fact of deliverance is mentioned, but the nature of the deliverance is not indicated there; cessation of persecution would not be deliverance, for only Israel was persecuted. The application of the phrases of our Lord have a totally different reference - the Jews perished, the Christians were delivered. There is here another evidence of dislocation. <span class="accented">Every one that shall be found written in the book.</span> There seems to be a faint reminiscence of this in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>, and a clearer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>. Although "books" is here referred to, and referred to also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a>, yet the "books" are different. The "book" in the tenth chapter contains presumably an account beforehand of all that is to happen. This book is, so to speak, a register of the names of those who should stand through the fiery trial that was to try them and maintain their faithfulness. It is to be noted that the Septuagint makes this refer not to individuals, but to nations whose names shall be found written in the book. There seems nothing to justify such a reading. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-4. Michael signifies, Who is like God, and his name, with the title of the great Prince, points out the Divine Saviour. Christ stood for the children of our people in their stead as a sacrifice, bore the curse for them, to bear it from them. He stands for them in pleading for them at the throne of grace. And after the destruction of antichrist, the Lord Jesus shall stand at the latter day upon the earth; and He shall appear for the complete redemption of all his people. When God works deliverance from persecution for them, it is as life from the dead. When his gospel is preached, many who sleep in the dust, both Jews and Gentiles, shall be awakened by it out of their heathenism of Judaism. And in the end the multitude that sleep in the dust shall awake; many shall arise to life, and many to shame. There is glory reserved for all the saints in the future state, for all that are wise, wise for their souls and eternity. Those who turn many to righteousness, who turn sinners from the errors of their ways, and help to save their souls from death, Jas 5:20, will share in the glory of those they have helped to heaven, which will add to their own glory.</body></html>
