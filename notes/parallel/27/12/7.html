<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-40.htm" title="For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>). Both hands are represented here as being raised up, so as to give greater importance to the words. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-5.htm" title="And the angel which I saw stand on the sea and on the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,">Revelation 10:5</a>, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-34.htm" title="And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honored him that lives for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:">Daniel 4:34</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">A time, times</span> . . .--See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm" title="And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.">Daniel 7:25</a>; and observe that any reference to the period of the persecution under Antiochus is impossible, on account of the difference between the measures of time. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-14.htm" title="And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.">Daniel 7:14</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">To scatter.</span>--The ancient versions (not the LXX., however) appear to have understood this to mean the dispersion of Israel (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-6.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God: the LORD your God has chosen you to be a special people to himself, above all people that are on the face of the earth.">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>), and seem to have connected the "<span class= "ital">end,"</span> of which Daniel speaks, with the cessation of the dispersion of Israel, or, in other words, to have regarded it as a prediction of the re-gathering of Israel, which would immediately precede the coming of Elias. (See the remarks of Theodoret on the passage.) But by the "holy people" are meant, more probably, those who shall suffer in the last days (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm" title="And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.">Daniel 7:25</a>, "the saints"), and the word "scatter" means to break in pieces, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-9.htm" title="You shall break them with a rod of iron; you shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.">Psalm 2:9</a>, &c. So that the words imply that the end will not come till "the shattering of the power of the saints" has been accomplished, or till persecution appears to have stamped out all that remains of godliness. This makes the prophecy accord with <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm" title="And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.">Daniel 7:25</a> and the parallel passages in the New Testament.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard the man clothed in</span> <span class="cmt_word">linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.</span> The Septuagint essentially agrees with this. It omits "man" in the first clause; has "water" instead of "waters;" adds "God" as explanatory of "him that liveth for ever;" it renders "scatter the power" by "loose the hands." Theodotion, while agreeing with the Massoretic text as to the first portion of the verse, differs very much in the end. He renders, "when the scattering is finished, they shall know these things." There is, as will be seen, no reference to the "holy people." His manuscript must have omitted "holy," for the rest may be explained by a false division into words, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5dd;</span> being read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;</span> The Massoretic reading is to be preferred. The Peshitta and Vulgate do not call for remark. <span class="accented">When he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven.</span> The lifting up the hand, in sign of making a solemn asseveration, is used of God himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>), of Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-22.htm">Genesis 14:22</a>), of the angel in the passage in Revelation founded on this (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-5.htm">Revelation 10:5</a>). Here the fact that both right hand and left hand are lifted up to heaven gives greater solemnity to the act. <span class="accented">And sware by him that liveth for ever.</span> This title is ascribed to God in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34</a> (31); also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>; the idea is involved in the name Jehovah (Yahveh). The relationship between the oath and the ascription to God, on whose faithfulness its fulfilment depended, is obvious, The fact that the "man clothed in linen" thus "swears" implies that in some way he is the source of the determination of the period. This notion is involved in the whole spiritual scenery of the Book of Daniel; the angels of the nations are the agents under God for carrying out the decrees of providence. <span class="accented">That it shall be for a time</span>, <span class="accented">times</span>, <span class="accented">and an half.</span> This is a space of time repeatedly used in the Biblical apocalypses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-3.htm">Revelation 11:3</a>, the same period seems to be represented by twelve hundred and sixty days. In the present case twelve hundred and ninety days seem to be regarded as equivalent to the "time, times, and an half (ver. 11). The divergency of interpretation comes to its height here. A great number of interpreters - not merely those of the critical school - maintain that "time" here is a literal year, and the days of the succeeding verses literal days, and that the period in question is that between the desecration of the temple by Antiochus's orders, and the setting up "the abomination of desolation" (1 Macc. 1:54), till the Jews were able to sacrifice once more in the re-consecrated temple (1 Macc. 4:52). This period, however, is only ten days over the three years from the 15th Casleu, 145 of the era of the Seleucids, to the 25th Casleu, 148. Or, if we take the date from the time that sacrifices to Jupiter began, till the re-establishment of the worship of Jehovah, it is then exactly three years from the 25th Casleu to the 25th Casleu. This period is not sufficient. Professor Moses Stuart gets over the difficulty by reckoning back from the cleansing of the temple to what he consider, the probable date of Antiochus's entrance into Jerusalem on his retreat from Egypt. This, however, is arbitrary, as the eleventh verse makes the <span class="accented">terminus a quo</span> the setting up of the "abomination of desolation," which occurred in 145, Seleucid era. Professor Bevan would reckon to the death of Antiochus. Of this event we only know it happened in 149, Seleucid era (1 Macc. 6:16). If the year began, as the Maceabaean reckoning seems to have been, with the month Nisan, it might be that approximately three years and a half was the time from the desecration of the temple to the death of Anti-ochua But the death of Antiochus produced but little change on the condition of the Jews. In the following year Lysias inflicted a defeat on Judas and besieged Jerusalem, and captured a portion of the city. To some extent we have anticipated our remarks on this text when considering <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>. There are, however, peculiarities due to the fact that Aramaic, not Hebrew, is the language used in that passage. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">mo'ed</span>), here rendered "time." is translated "congregation" most generally in the Peutatcuch. Sometimes it is "feast," and sometimes it is "season;" but if the word here means a definite period of time, it is the only case in which it does so, and it is a word that appears several hundreds of times in the Scriptures. We admit that the enumeration of days which follows renders the assertion that <span class="accented">mo'ed</span> means here a "year," to some extent plausible, yet only plausible. But the next question arises - Even though we should grant that it means a year, are we to understand a literal year? We saw that the "weeks" of ch. 9. are not to be taken literally, but as weeks of years, in which each day stands for a year; the contention of the traditional interpreters has then a justification from analogy in taking a <span class="accented">mo'ed</span>, if a "year," to be one of three hundred and sixty or three hundred and sixty-five years. Not only is the extent of time indicated here extremely doubtful, but the <span class="accented">terminus a qao</span> is also. Although the writer of 1 Maccabees fixes the setting up the abomination of desolation, that is only his interpretation. Our Lord, on the other hand, refers it to the Roman conquest of Jerusalem, which was a vastly more thorough destruction than that inflicted by Antiochus. The meaning of this period is not fixed yet. <span class="accented">When he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people.</span> Professor Bevan would change the reading here, as from the order of the Greek words in the Septuagint he deduces that the order in the text before the translator was different from that in the Massoretic text. He would render, "When the power of the shatterer of the holy people shall come to an end." Behrmann sees grammatical difficulties, but these are not cogent; but the argument for this change is weak. Yet we prefer, though with difficulty, Professor Bevan's reading. It makes the connection much simpler to take this solution, as the end of all things is not the scattering of the holy people, but their building up. If we had any authority from the versions we should be inclined to read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, and insert <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> before <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, and thus would wish to render, "From the breaking of the power of the scatterer of the holy people till all these things are ended." This gives beth <span class="accented">termini</span>, but none of the versions gives any hint of such a reading. <span class="accented">All these things shall be finished.</span> As the resurrection is mentioned in the second verse, we might at once assume that this refers to the end of time; but <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-34.htm">Matthew 24:34</a>, compared with 30, renders this conclusion doubtful. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:5-13 One of the angels asking how long it should be to the end of these wonders, a solemn reply is made, that it would be for a time, times, and a half, the period mentioned ch. 7:25, and in the Revelation. It signifies 1260 prophetic days or years, beginning from the time when the power of the holy people should be scattered. The imposture of Mohammed, and the papal usurpation, began about the same time; and these were a twofold attack upon the church of God. But all will end well at last. All opposing rule, principality, and power, shall be put down, and holiness and love will triumph, and be in honour, to eternity. The end, this end, shall come. What an amazing prophecy is this, of so many varied events, and extending through so many successive ages, even to the general resurrection! Daniel must comfort himself with the pleasing prospect of his own happiness in death, in judgment, and to eternity. It is good for us all to think much of going away from this world. That must be our way; but it is our comfort that we shall not go till God calls us to another world, and till he has done with us in this world; till he says, Go thou thy way, thou hast done thy work, therefore now, go thy way, and leave it to others to take thy place. It was a comfort to Daniel, and is a comfort to all the saints, that whatever their lot is in the days of their lives, they shall have a happy lot in the end of the days. And it ought to be the great care and concern of every one of us to secure this. Then we may well be content with our present lot, and welcome the will of God. Believers are happy at all times; they rest in God by faith now, and a rest is reserved for them in heaven at last.</body></html>
