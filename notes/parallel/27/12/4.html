The revelation continues to be called by the same name, "the words," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-1.htm" title="In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.">Daniel 10:1</a>; and now the prophet is told that the book in which this revelation is written must be placed in a safe and sure place, for the need of it will be felt in "the time of the end," that is, in the time when the fulfilment makes the meaning of the prophecy clear and unambiguous.<p><span class= "bld">Many shall run to and fro.--</span>The verb "to run" is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-1.htm" title="Run you to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if you can find a man, if there be any that executes judgment, that seeks the truth; and I will pardon it.">Jeremiah 5:1</a> of searching after knowledge. In this sense it is used of "the eyes of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-10.htm" title="For who has despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.">Zechariah 4:10</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-12.htm" title="And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find it.">Amos 8:12</a>). In the same sense it is used in this verse. Many will anxiously search in this book for knowledge of the manner of God's dealings with His people, and will derive comfort and understanding therefrom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased</span>. The Septuagint rendering in the last portion of the verse is totally different from the Masserotic recension, which is correctly rendered in our English version, "And thou, Daniel, hide the commands and seal the book till the time of the end, till many shall rave violently (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) and the earth be filled with unrighteousness." It is possible that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bb;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">yeshoogg'oo</span>), "were mad," was read instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d8;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">yishoetoo</span>), "ran to and fro." In the older script <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;</span>. was not unlike <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;</span>. Professor Bevan has suggested that instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">hadda'th</span>), "the knowledge," the Septuagint translator has read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">hara'oth</span>), "the evils," and thinks that this gives the Septuagint Greek. Were one, however, to render the Greek back into Hebrew, that would not be the form the words would take. It may, however, be regarded as a paraphrase. Theodotion's version is closer to the Massoretic, "And thou, Daniel, shalt guard (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, ('make a fence round') the words, and seal the book till the time of the end, till many shall be taught, and knowledge shall be fulfilled." Theodotion here takes <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d9;&#x5d8;</span> as meaning, not "run to and fro," but "peruse carefully." The last clause somewhat justifies Professor Bevan's suggestion: <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> used to mean "fulfil" or "fill out." The Peshitta renders, "And thou, then, Daniel, seal these commands, render silent, and seal this book till the time of the end, and many shall inquire, and knowledge shall be increased." The Vulgate agrees on the whole with the Massoretic text. <span class="accented">Shut up the words.</span> The exact rendering of the words is "close up;" hence Theodotion's rendering "put a rampart round," the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">satham</span>), means generally "to stop up a well;" <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-19.htm">2 Kings 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-30.htm">2 Chronicles 32:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-15.htm">Genesis 26:15</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-1.htm">Nehemiah 4:1</a> (7) it is used of stopping the breaches in the wall; only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-3.htm">Ezekiel 28:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8</a> (6) is the word rendered, even in the English versions, "hidden;" but even in these cases that is not the necessary or even the natural meaning of the woful. These remarks apply also to <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-26.htm">Daniel 8:26</a>. <span class="accented">Seal the book.</span> There is a question as to the force of this phrase. Does it mean, as Hitzig, Bevan, and the critical school generally maintain it means, that the book was to be hidden and concealed? This view, if correct, would certainly give a plausibility to the contention that the book of Daniel is the work of a <span class="accented">falsarisu.</span> We have seen, however, that the real meaning of the verb translated "shut up" is not "conceal," but "to shut up" with the view certainly of hindering access to them, but not at all with the intention of concealment. So the "sealing" here does not necessarily indicate concealment, but rather the conclusion of the matter with further idea of confirmation. The oracles of God are regarded as a spring of water; if we follow the figure implied in the first word used, the flow is stopped now; so far as this message is concerned, nothing more is to be drawn from the fountain. But a fountain may also be sealed (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-12.htm">Song of Solomon 4:12</a>, "A garden enclosed, a fountain sealed"). In that case there is no idea of concealment. The book, then, of the prophecy is to be sealed against any change or addition. Even take the view of the critics, there is here no elaborate directions as to the concealment of the vision as we find in the case of the 'Assumption of Moses.' But further, we have no account of the finding of the book. Daniel was not like the 'Assumption of Moses,' the esoteric possession of a single sect, it was on the critical hypothesis soon known all over Palestine and Egypt. We know that the finding of the book of the Law in the reign of Josiah is narrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22</a>. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34.htm">2 Chronicles 34</a>; but neither 1 Maccabees nor 2 Maccabees says a word about the finding of the Book of Daniel. Josephus also has no word of the discovery of Daniel, although he relates the finding of the book of the Law in the days of Josiah. There must have been no tradition of such a thing taking place, yet two centuries was not so long as to obliterate tradition. The sealing had metaphorical meaning - a book sealed, though it was visible to the eye, and was not hidden away - could not be read. If the key by which to interpret it is not granted, a book in cipher cannot be read (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-11.htm">Isaiah 29:11, 12</a>, "And the vision of all is become unto you as a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot, for it is sealed. And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned." If the book were sealed that it could not be opened, the delivering of the book and the request to read it would be meaningless). Prophecy was delivered frequently in enigmatic language, and the meaning of it could only be grasped when circumstance supplied the key. <span class="accented">To the time of the end.</span> The end is not the end of the persecution of the days of Antiochus - that is already past; we have now reached the consummation of all things. <span class="accented">Many shall run to and fro</span>, <span class="accented">and knowledge shall be increased.</span> This is to be looked upon as a description of the last time, when circumstance shall remove the seal from the book. The translator of the Septuagint has been led away by the idea of the time as one of sorrow. The verb, however, translated "going to and fro" may be rendered, as it is by Ewald, as "to peruse." The veil then shall be removed, the seals broken when men peruse the prophecy carefully, and knowledge is increased. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-4. Michael signifies, Who is like God, and his name, with the title of the great Prince, points out the Divine Saviour. Christ stood for the children of our people in their stead as a sacrifice, bore the curse for them, to bear it from them. He stands for them in pleading for them at the throne of grace. And after the destruction of antichrist, the Lord Jesus shall stand at the latter day upon the earth; and He shall appear for the complete redemption of all his people. When God works deliverance from persecution for them, it is as life from the dead. When his gospel is preached, many who sleep in the dust, both Jews and Gentiles, shall be awakened by it out of their heathenism of Judaism. And in the end the multitude that sleep in the dust shall awake; many shall arise to life, and many to shame. There is glory reserved for all the saints in the future state, for all that are wise, wise for their souls and eternity. Those who turn many to righteousness, who turn sinners from the errors of their ways, and help to save their souls from death, Jas 5:20, will share in the glory of those they have helped to heaven, which will add to their own glory.</body></html>
