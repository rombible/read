The image, though representing many things, was itself only "one." (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-1.htm" title="And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, with which his spirit was troubled, and his sleep broke from him.">Daniel 2:1</a>.) That the image was of human form is evident from the further descriptions of the various parts of the body given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/2-32.htm" title="This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,">Daniel 2:32-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-42.htm" title="And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.">Daniel 2:42</a>. The "greatness" of the image implies the magnificence and size of it. As will be shortly seen, throughout the various parts it represented the many complex phases of the one history of the world.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible</span>. The Greek versions do not require notice, as they do not imply any difference in reading from the Massoretic text. The Peshitta is shorter, "Thou, O king, wert seeing, and, lo! a great image of beauty exceeding excellent, and it stood before thee." The opening clause of the next verse may be regarded as taking up the last clause of the verse before us. As to the Aramaic of the passage, it is to be observed that the s, me long form of the second person is used in ver. 29. The numeral <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">had</span>) is used in this verse very much in the sense of the English indefinite article which is used to translate it in the English versions. It is represented in the Greek Version by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. The particle <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> ('<span class="accented">ulu</span>)," behold," does not occur in the Targums; a cognate form occurs in Samaritan, <span class="accented">hala.</span> In Talmudic it occurs in a form like the Samaritan. This word occurs in ch. 7, varied by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> ('<span class="accented">aru</span>), which is regarded as a phonetic variation. It may, however, be due to defective penmanship, having the top of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> too faintly written. Its etymology is doubtful. No Assyrian root has been found from which it may be derived. The word for "image," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">tzelem</span>), occurs in the Palmyrene inscriptions, as the regular term for a memorial statue. Hence, unless reason can be shown to the contrary, we could assume, even though there had been no more, that the figure was like a statue of a man. The word for this, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">diccen</span>), occurs only in Daniel; the corresponding word in Ezra is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">dec</span>). The n sound is one that so readily slips away, that its presence as a final letter is a sign that the form of a word possessing it is in an older stage than that without it; hence we would argue that as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">dec</span>) is older than <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">da</span>) of the Targums, so <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">diccen</span>) of Daniel is older than <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">dec</span>). The word that is most interesting is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">ziveh</span>); it is rendered "brightness" in our version. It is recognized by Professor Bevan, on the authority of Delitzsch, as an Assyrio-Babylonian word, therefore affording an additional evidence of the Eastern origin of Daniel. Noldeke would derive it from the Persian <span class="accented">zeb</span> (quoted by Behrmann, but there is some mistake in his reference). This tendency to derive everything from the Persian is to be suspected. The long political connection between Babylon and the Aryan nations north and east of it might easily introduce words of such an origin into the writings of a Babylonian diplomat. Another derivation is from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">zahah</span>), but seems doubtful, as, although in Hebrew, there is no trace of such a verb in Aramaic. The only other word that merits note is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d5;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">reve</span>), "appearance." Professor Bevan <span class="accented">says</span> it is the only appearance in Aramaic of a corresponding root to the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">ra'ah</span>), "to see." Daniel, it will be seen, lays <span class="accented">stress</span> on the emotions which each feature excited, in order to recall, not only the dream, but something of the feelings with which Nebuchadnezzar had beheld it. With this dream of Nebuchadnezzar we might compare the dream of the seer of Asshurbanipal, given by Lenormant ('La Divination,' p. 137), "The seer (<span class="accented">voyant</span>) narrated to Asshurbanipal how the goddess Istar had stood before him seated in her chariot, surrounded by flame, with a bow in her hand" (see also Smith's 'Assurbanipal,' pp. 123. 124). It is unlikely that the colossal image was identified by Nebuchadnezzar with any one of the Babylonian gods; perhaps this was one of the elements of the terror excited by the vision, that he could not identify him. If he did make any identification, Daniel does not do anything to justify him in any such identification. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:31-45 This image represented the kingdoms of the earth, that should successively rule the nations, and influence the affairs of the Jewish church. 1. The head of gold signified the Chaldean empire, then in being. 2. The breast and arms of silver signified the empire of the Medes and Persians. 3. The belly and thighs of brass signified the Grecian empire, founded by Alexander. 4. The legs and feet of iron signified the Roman empire. The Roman empire branched into ten kingdoms, as the toes of these feet. Some were weak as clay, others strong as iron. Endeavours have often been used to unite them, for strengthening the empire, but in vain. The stone cut out without hands, represented the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, which should be set up in the kingdoms of the world, upon the ruins of Satan's kingdom in them. This was the Stone which the builders refused, because it was not cut out by their hands, but it is become the head stone of the corner. Of the increase of Christ's government and peace there shall be no end. The Lord shall reign, not only to the end of time, but when time and days shall be no more. As far as events have gone, the fulfilling this prophetic vision has been most exact and undeniable; future ages shall witness this Stone destroying the image, and filling the whole earth.</body></html>
