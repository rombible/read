The king saw this gigantic statue, not possessing the attributes of any of his national gods, and he looks on in his dream in wonder and awe. <span class="accented">Till a stone cut out without hands.</span> The Greek versions make an addition which seems necessary to the sense - "out of the mountain." This addition may certainly have been made from the later verse (ver. 45). The logical necessity, however, may have prompted this addition. On the other hand, the evidence of both the Greek versions agreeing in one addition ha. very considerable weight. It is not impossible that the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">mitturah</span>), "from the mountain," had dropped from the manuscripts used by the Massoretes. In favour of the Massoretic text is the fact that the Peshitta omits the word. On the other band, Jerome adds de monte. It may be noted, as at least a curiosity, that the Peshitta, instead of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d1;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">aben</span>)," a stone," gives <span class="accented">kepha</span>, from which Cephas, the name of the Apostle Peter, is derived. As the monarch gazes at the huge image, he <span class="accented">sees</span> behind the image a mountain towering above the image, huge as it is. From this mountain he sees a boulder detach itself, as if it were being cut with chisel and wedge, but no hands are risible. Once set loose from the mountain's side, it came by bounds and leaps down the declivity, "<span class="accented">and</span> <span class="accented">smote the image</span> upon <span class="accented">his feet that were of iron and clay."</span> Every bound that the stone makes down the mountain is larger, and raises it higher and makes it strike the earth with more of force, till with a bound greater than any it had made before, it strikes the feet of the image, "which were of iron <span class="accented">and</span> clay" mingled, yet separate - and at once they are broken in pieces: "utterly crushed" is the meaning of the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">duq</span>). The Septuagint tendering is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "ground;" it occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-20.htm">Exodus 32:20</a>, of Moses grinding the golden calf to powder. Theodotion's word is not a correct rendering of the word; it is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "beat into thin scales;" comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21.htm">Matthew 21</a>:(42) 45 ("the stone which the builders rejected"), "on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder." It is to be observed that this cutting of the stone out of the mountain took place after the fourth portion of the image was clearly visible. In the dream the catastrophe took place after the stone had been cut from the mountain and had bounded down its side. A similar chronological succession may be expected in the events foreshadowed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:31-45 This image represented the kingdoms of the earth, that should successively rule the nations, and influence the affairs of the Jewish church. 1. The head of gold signified the Chaldean empire, then in being. 2. The breast and arms of silver signified the empire of the Medes and Persians. 3. The belly and thighs of brass signified the Grecian empire, founded by Alexander. 4. The legs and feet of iron signified the Roman empire. The Roman empire branched into ten kingdoms, as the toes of these feet. Some were weak as clay, others strong as iron. Endeavours have often been used to unite them, for strengthening the empire, but in vain. The stone cut out without hands, represented the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, which should be set up in the kingdoms of the world, upon the ruins of Satan's kingdom in them. This was the Stone which the builders refused, because it was not cut out by their hands, but it is become the head stone of the corner. Of the increase of Christ's government and peace there shall be no end. The Lord shall reign, not only to the end of time, but when time and days shall be no more. As far as events have gone, the fulfilling this prophetic vision has been most exact and undeniable; future ages shall witness this Stone destroying the image, and filling the whole earth.</body></html>
