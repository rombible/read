<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-16.htm" title="And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance to the king. And the king said, What would you?">1Kings 1:16</a>. The Hebrew word employed here is always used (<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-6.htm" title="They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, and hire a goldsmith; and he makes it a god: they fall down, yes, they worship.">Isaiah 46:6</a>) of paying adoration to an idol. Probably the king imagined that the gods were dwelling in Daniel in a higher sense from that in which they dwelt with his other wise men, and worshipped them on account of the marvellous revelation which they had vouchsafed to him through the means of Daniel.<p><span class= "bld">Oblation.</span>--That is, the unbloody offering customary among the Babylonians; some honour different from the present mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-48.htm" title="Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.">Daniel 2:48</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.</span> The Greek versions render in such a way that we are almost obliged to recognize an act of idolatrous worship. Jerome, too, distinctly says," Nebuchodonoser... Danielem ador-avit et hostias et incensnm praecepit ut sacri-ficarent." The same idea is conveyed by the Peshitta, but less definitely, from the fact that <span class="accented">qorban</span> means a "gift" as well as an "oblation;" though the gift is usually a consecrated gift. In the Aramaic of the Bible we have certain phrases used for "sacrifice;" several of these are here employed: it is true all of them have the possibility of being used in a somewhat lower meaning. The mere "falling down before Daniel upon his face," when the person who did it was Nebuchadnezzar, is extraordinary, and can only be explained by the idea of worship. When we find the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">segad</span>) used immediately after, it is very difficult to refuse to believe that the Greek Version and Jerome are right when they translate the latter word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>. The word occurs repeatedly in the following chapter, invariably as "worship." The corresponding Hebrew word occurs in the second chapter of Isaiah, in the sense of "idolatrous worship" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-20.htm">Isaiah 2:20</a>). It certainly does mean "to bend." Had the word thus stood alone, we could not have been certain that it meant "worship;" but when it follows the extreme act of prostration to the earth, "worship' must be meant. The separate terms, <span class="accented">minhah</span>, <span class="accented">nihohin</span>, <span class="accented">lenassakah lah</span>, might, taken separately, mean "gifts" and the "bestowment of gifts;" but, taken together, it is impossible not to regard the action as one of sacrificial offering. It is true <span class="accented">minhah</span> means "a present," as when Jacob sends a present to Esau (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-13.htm">Genesis 32:13</a>); but, in that connection, <span class="accented">nasak is</span> not used. It is quite true that the burning of sweet odours was a common enough thing in entertaining guests whom it was desired to honour, but the term <span class="accented">neehoheen</span> was not given to the aromatic woods so used. People sometimes, even at present, scent their rooms by burning aromatic woods, but they never in such <span class="accented">cases</span> call them <span class="accented">incense.</span> But from the fact that the old Greek version and Jerome read <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">hostias</span>, the doubt seems forced upon us that the reading here has been altered, and that the true reading was <span class="accented">deebheen -</span> not <span class="accented">neehoheen - this</span> is a change that could with difficulty be imagined as occurring accidentally, but readily enough might happen from the desire to defend Daniel from the charge of allowing idolatrous worship to be offered to him. The instance referred to as parallel - the homage which Josephus relates Alexander the Great gave to Jaddua - is not quite on all fours with the present case. We are, in the first place, expressly told that it was "<span class="accented">the</span> name" of Jehovah, engraved on the <span class="accented">petalon</span> on the front of the priest's mitre, that Alexander worshipped (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). In the next place, we have no notice of sacrifice or incense being ordered to be offered to the high priest. It is not correct to say that <span class="accented">nasak</span> of necessity means "pour out an oblation," to the exclusion of the more general meaning of "<span class="accented">offer sacrifice."</span> The corresponding word in Arabic means "to sacrifice" (Behrmann). Behrmann says, in regard to this, truly, "As to Porphyry later, so to the author and to the first readers of this book, it would have seemed indecent if Daniel had allowed himself to be honoured as a god." This would have been true had the author been a contemporary of the Maccabees. The tide of feeling that led Peter to refuse the prostration of Cornelius, and Paul and Barnabas the sacrifices at Lystra, would have prevented any one inventing such a scene. It is perfectly true the worship was probably directed to the Divine Spirit as resident in Daniel, rather than to Daniel himself; few except the lowest and most degraded of heathen worshipped idols in any other way - the divine spirit, the deity, was the real object of worship, whose sign they were, and who resided in them. We must bear in mind that Daniel had been brought up in an idolatrous court, perhaps, also, he had to submit, on pain of suffering the fate that befell Paul and Barnabas when they refused the worship of the people of Lystra. We must lay stress on the very different relationship to idolatry and its worship implied in Daniel thus suffering sacrifice and incense to be offered to him, from that subsisting in the time of the Maccabees. No writer of that period would have written a sacred romance in which he represented a servant of God receiving idolatrous honours. The attitude of later Judaism is exemplified by Jephet-ibn-Ali, who says that though "Nebuchadnezzar commanded that sacrifices be brought to him as to a god, he (Daniel) does not say that he brought them to him. Most probably Daniel prohibited him from doing so." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:46-49 It is our business to direct attention to the Lord, as the Author and Giver of every good gift. Many have thoughts of the Divine power and majesty, who do not think of serving God themselves. But all should strive, that God may be glorified, and the best interests of mankind furthered.</body></html>
