This is the rendering of the Septuagint. Theodotion and Jerome render the first word, which is really the relative, as "therefore," e<span class="accented">rgo</span>, "then," <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>. The Peshitta has <span class="accented">den</span>, the corresponding Syriac phrase, which has a similar <span class="accented">sense</span> to that assumed here. The rendering of the next clause, both in the Septuagint and in the version of Theodotion, differs considerably from the Massoretic text. The rendering of the Septuagint is as follows: "If ye do not truly tell me the dream, an,l show me the interpretation, ye shall die." The version of Theodotion is shorter, "It, then, ye will not tell me the dream." Theodotion thus omits the clause translated, "there is <span class="accented">but one decree for you</span>;" the only word that may be the remains of it is <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;&#x5ea;</span>, or simply the participle, The Syriac is, "If ye will not declare the dream to me, one is your plan and your word." The text of the Septuagint in this case indicates that we have here additions from previous verses. The phrase, "and declare to me the interpretation," is evidently supplied from ver. 5, whereas "ye shall die." literally, "ye shall chance to (fall into) death," has a different origin. This phrase has all the appearance of a translation. It would seem applicable on the idea that in the text before the Septuagint translator, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5ea;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">datheon</span>), "your decree," there stood <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5ea;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">motheon</span>), "your death," the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">vav</span>) being omitted, and possibly the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;</span> (be), and <span class="accented">milch</span> being read into some part of <span class="accented">nephal</span>, "to fall," probably <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">tippelun</span>). The omission of this clause, as above mentioned, from Theodotion renders it a little doubtful, as it indicates that in the text used by the Jews of Asia Minor this phrase was awanting. Most commentators take <span class="accented">dath</span> in the sense more common in Eastern than in Western Aramaic, of "pica" rather than "decree" Ewald and Professor Bevan oppose this view, as also Keil, the last with great positiveness. The facts that so many commentators give this meaning, and that certain Rabbinic authorities reterred to but not named by Jephet-ibn-Ali prove it to be no impossible translation. Hitzig, Von Lengerke, Maurer, Michaelis, and Moses Stuart are not quite despicable. The main reason against this view is that in Western Aramaic <span class="accented">dath</span> means "decree," in Eastern Aramaic it means, according to Castell, <span class="accented">scopus</span>, <span class="accented">meta</span>, <span class="accented">finis</span>, <span class="accented">voluntas.</span> The only difficulty is that he gives no reference, and Brockel-mann gives only <span class="accented">lex</span>, which in this case it cannot be, though this is the only reference beside Hoffmann's 'Glossary.' It might be an individual "decree," but a "law" it cannot be. On the received renderings the succession is somewhat violent. "If ye will not tell me the dream, one is your decree," can only be made consecutive by a violent jerk away back to the fifth verse. It seems more natural to take it as meaning, "Ye have agreed together to say one thing to me." The accusation of conspiracy naturally followed from the king's firm conviction that the soothsayers could tell, if they only would, what he required of them. If there began to dawn upon him any idea that their silence was due to inability to answer, it might well move him to redoubled anger that they had been guilty of imposture in claiming such lofty powers and being so highly paid and honoured for their exercise. The king's mind had not yet abandoned the faith of his fathers in magic and divination. For ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me. It' the Septuagint is to be taken as our guide, the word <span class="accented">shheethah</span> is a doubtful addition to the Massoretic text It is, however, in the other later versions. According to the rendering of both the Greek versions, the meaning here is stronger than that which is expressed in the Authorized Version; <span class="accented">hizdaminton</span> really means "to conspire." He will not admit the plea of inability to satisfy his demands - the vague suspicion may be floating before his mind - as, if he were to admit their inability to satisfy what he wished to learn, then, according to his logic, all their claims were false. Hence the accusation of "lying and corrupt words" would still stand, and have all the greater emphasis. Waiving the question of the authenticity of "<span class="accented">corrupt</span>," the distinction between the two words "<span class="accented">lying"</span> and "corrupt" seems to be in this: the first refers to the person addressed - to Nebuchadnezzar, - the words are untrue, they are lies - as coming from the soothsayers they are "<span class="accented">corrupt</span>," because they are symptomatic of a corrupt disposition, probably traitor, us. Till the time be changed. Theodotion renders here. "till the time be passed." The Septuagint follows a similar reading to that in the Massoretic text. The Peshitta rendering is akin to that of Theodotion. While in all forms of magic and soothsaying, time was an element not to be neglected, it was doubly important in regard to astrology, and an hour or two changed the position of the moon in relation to the constellations. If something required to be clone in consequence of this dream, then most likely it would require to be done in a certain relation of the heavenly bodies to each other. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation thereof. The Septuagint rendering is paraphrastic, "Now then, if ye tell me the thing which I saw in the night, I shall know that ye can also show the interpretation." While we have called it a paraphrase as regards the Massoretic text, the rendering in the Septuagint may represent the Egyptian recension of the text of Daniel. The use of <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> or "thing" suggests translation, and assumes <span class="accented">millah</span> or <span class="accented">mill'tha</span>, which has the same double suggestion of "word spoken" and "thing spoken about." If the Septuagint text were assumed here, we should have confirmation of our view that Nebuchadnezzar remembered his vision, but was determined to experiment on the soothsayers of his court. This view is certainly implied in the following clause. The first word of this clause is peculiar grammatically: <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> ('<span class="accented">in'd'a</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;</span> ('<span class="accented">iyda</span>) or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> ('idda). This form of compensating for a dropped consonant by inserting <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span> (<span class="accented">nun</span>) instead of doubling occurs elsewhere in Biblical Aramaic (see ver. 30). This is rare in Syriac, and in the Targums found only in those later, especially those of the Megilloth, which have affinities with the form of Aramaic seen in the Babylonian Talmud. This peculiarity is common in the Maudaitic dialect. It is thus a distinctively Eastern form of Aramaic that is indicated here. When we pass beyond the grammatical elements, we find that Nebuchadnezzar would take correct information as to what he had dreamed a guarantee of the correctness of the interpretation of the dream which the soothsayers might afterwards give him. His attitude was purely and truly scientific, as it is stated. In his own mind he was warped and confused by his overmastering belief in omens and auguries, in gods and demons, in magicians and astrologers. With this faith in his heart, his only explanation of the silence of these soothsayers was treason. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-13 The greatest men are most open to cares and troubles of mind, which disturb their repose in the night, while the sleep of the labouring man is sweet and sound. We know not the uneasiness of many who live in great pomp, and, as others vainly think, in pleasure also. The king said that his learned men must tell him the dream itself, or they should all be put to death as deceivers. Men are more eager to ask as to future events, than to learn the way of salvation or the path of duty; yet foreknowledge of future events increases anxiety and trouble. Those who deceived, by pretending to do what they could not do, were sentenced to death, for not being able to do what they did not pretend to.</body></html>
