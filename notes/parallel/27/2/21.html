Daniel refers to the dream which had been recently revealed to him, in which the changes of future times and seasons were depicted in so marvellous a way. "Times" are opposed to "seasons," as circumstances of time may be contrasted with epochs of time.

Wise men become what they are, not through their own study and natural ability, but by the grace and mercy of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding</span>. In regard to this verse, Theodotion and the Septuagint only differ in this from the Massoretic text, that they omit the repetition of the word "kings." The Peshitta has a different sense in the middle clause. "He maketh (Peshitta, <span class="accented">ma'bed</span>) kings and confirmeth (Peshitta, <span class="accented">maqeem</span>) kings" The Syriac translators have evidently read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">meh</span> '<span class="accented">deh</span>), "to remove," as <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">meha'bed</span>), "<span class="accented">to</span> make" The utter want of contrast in this reading condemns it. In regard to the Aramaic of this passage, the carrying on of the preformative <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span>, the sign of the haphel conjugation, is a proof of the early date of the Aramaic. In later Aramaic, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> gives place to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> disappears after the other preformative as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>. <span class="accented">Changeth times and seasons.</span> Nebuchadnezzar was anxious lest the time in which he might make advantageous use of the information conveyed by the dream should pass away, and a new "time" be established. Not improbably Nebuchadnezzar, like most heathens, imagined that his gods were limited by some unseen power like the Greek Fate, and, however wishful they might be to be propitious to their worshippers only in certain collocations of the heavenly bodies could they carry out their wish. God, the God of heaven, the God of the despised Hebrews, he it was who arranged the times and the seasons, he made the sun to rise, he makes summer and winter, he leads out the host of the stars, alike the star of Nebo and the star of Marduk. The two words "time" and "season" are nearly synonymous. Perhaps the first is more indefinite than the other. Our own opinion is that the first has more the idea of space of time, and the latter more of point of time; but really they are almost synonymous. <span class="accented">He removeth kings</span>, <span class="accented">and setteth up kings.</span> In this there seems to be a special reference to the contents of the vision, which showed that in the time to come, not only kings but dynasties were to be set up and overthrown. The former clause regarded God as the God of nature. This looks u pen him as the God of providence, by whom "kings reign, and princes decree justice." <span class="accented">He giveth wisdom unto the wise</span>, <span class="accented">and knowledge to them that know understand-lag.</span> This address to God goes further. Daniel sees in the faculties and mental acquirements of men the manifestation of God. It is the inspiration of the Almighty that giveth understanding. All the power man has of acquiring knowledge, all the faculty he has for using that knowledge aright, all come from God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:14-23 Daniel humbly prayed that God would discover to him the king's dream, and the meaning of it. Praying friends are valuable friends; and it well becomes the greatest and best men to desire the prayers of others. Let us show that we value our friends, and their prayers. They were particular in prayer. And whatever we pray for, we can expect nothing but as the gift of God's mercies. God gives us leave in prayer to tell our wants and burdens. Their plea with God was, the peril they were in. The mercy Daniel and his fellows prayed for, was bestowed. The fervent prayers of righteous men avail much. Daniel was thankful to God for making known that to him, which saved the lives of himself and his fellows. How much more should we be thankful to God, for making known the great salvation of the soul to those who are not among the worldly wise and prudent!</body></html>
