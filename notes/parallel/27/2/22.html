Man himself requires illumination from an external source. This source is God, the "sun of man's soul," in Whom light dwells as if He were a palace, and in "His light do we see light" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-9.htm" title="For with you is the fountain of life: in your light shall we see light.">Psalm 36:9</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He revealeth the deep and secret things; he knoweth what is in the darkness,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and the light dwelleth with him</span>. The rendering of the Septuagint as it stands differs somewhat from the Massoretic text, "Revealing deep things and dark, and knowing the things which are in the darkness and the things which are in the light, and with him is a dwelling-place (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>)." There is doubt as to the exact force of this last word; the last element in it suggests "solution." This meaning seems to have been given to it generally; for Paulus Tellensis renders it <span class="accented">shari</span>, which means a "solution," but as it is derived from <span class="accented">shera</span>, which means "to dwell," he retains the double meaning The reading of Kreysig is decidedly to be preferred, omitting <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> ("the things which") before "in the light," and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, "and," after. The rendering then would be, "in light is with him the dwelling-place." This rendering harmonizes the LXX. completely with the Massoretic. The other versions call for no remark. There is difference here between the Q'rl and K'thib. The Q'ri reads <span class="accented">nehora</span>, "light," a Chaldee or Western Aramaic form; the K'thib again is, <span class="accented">neheera</span>, the Eastern Aramaic form. God is not only the God of nature, of providence, and of man, but also of revelation. He can make known to man what otherwise man could never know. He is the very Source of all light and enlightenment. We may compare this statement with that of Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>; he speaks of God as "dwelling in light which no man can approach unto." It seems to us the words of the Old Testament song convey a loftier idea of God than does the Pauline statement - perhaps it is even loftier than the cognate phrase of the Apostle John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>), "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all." We may compare, in regard to this whole verse, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-12.htm">Psalm 139:12</a>, "The darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the tight are both alike to thee," where <span class="accented">neheera</span> is used as in the passage before us. Daniel ascribes to Jehovah all the powers of all the gods of Babylon. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:14-23 Daniel humbly prayed that God would discover to him the king's dream, and the meaning of it. Praying friends are valuable friends; and it well becomes the greatest and best men to desire the prayers of others. Let us show that we value our friends, and their prayers. They were particular in prayer. And whatever we pray for, we can expect nothing but as the gift of God's mercies. God gives us leave in prayer to tell our wants and burdens. Their plea with God was, the peril they were in. The mercy Daniel and his fellows prayed for, was bestowed. The fervent prayers of righteous men avail much.
