The Septuagint Version is simpler, "But as for me, not on account of any wisdom in me above all men is this mystery revealed, but in order that it should be shown to the king it is revealed to me what thou thoughtest in thy heart in knowledge." The translator has read the preformative <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;</span> into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;</span>. There is no reference to "those who shall show the interpretation." The text before him may have omitted the plural termination; consequently, the huphal was supplied. Theodotion, the Peshitta, and Jerome all agree pretty closely with the Massoretic text, but all make the verb translated "<span class="accented">shows"</span> singular, not plural, as does the Massoretic. Of course, it may be that this was due to rendering the sense, not the words, of the original; but Theodotion especially is more prone in any difficulty to slavish adherence to his original. His rendering is, "But as for me, not for wisdom which is in me beyond all living is the mystery revealed, but that the interpretation be made known to the king in order that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart." The Pe-shitta renders the latter clauses thus: "But that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that thou mayest know what thou didst meditate on in thy heart." Jerome, after rendering <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d6;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">raza</span>, "secret") <span class="accented">sacra-mentum</span>, proceeds," Sed ut interpretatio regi manifesta fieret et cogitationes mentis tuae seires." The fact that the last word takes the Mandaitic form <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">tin'dae</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">tidda</span>') indicates on the whole an Oriental origin. The use of the plural form, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">yehod'un</span>), <span class="accented">is</span> wrongly rendered, "for their sakes who shall make known the interpretation." The Revised Version is more accurate, "but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known;" and Luther translates, "Dass dem Konige die Deutung augezeiget warde." The use of the plural for the indefinite occurs elsewhere (Wirier, &sect; 49). The position Daniel takes up is one which does not separate him from the other <span class="accented">hakmeen</span> of the court. He in effect says, "I am no wiser than the other sages who have been condemned to death, only the God of heaven can reveal what the king demands, and he has revealed it to me." The purpose of the revelation, "that thou mightest know the interpretation," is fitted to soothe his pride. The humility of Daniel has been remarked in reference to this verse. He puts himself behind the impersonal form, "in order that people may show the king the interpretation." The reason why the interpretation was shown to Nebuchadnezzar might be really to humble him, to show him that his empire, splendid as it was, was only one in a succession, and that the whole system of world-empires would be overthrown before a kingdom set up by the God of the Jews. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:24-30 Daniel takes away the king's opinion of his magicians and soothsayers. The insufficiency of creatures should drive us to the all-sufficiency of the Creator. There is One who can do that for us, and make known that to us, which none on earth can, particularly the work of redemption, and the secret designs of God's love to us therein. Daniel confirmed the king in his opinion, that the dream was of great consequence, relating to the affairs and changes of this lower world. Let those whom God has highly favoured and honoured, lay aside all opinion of their own wisdom and worthiness, that the Lord alone may be praised for the good they have and do.</body></html>
