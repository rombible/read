Of the second and third empires, each borrowed something from that which preceded it. The fourth empire introduces a new system, and a new civilisation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise</span>. The version of the LXX. differs considerably here, "The fourth kingdom <span class="accented">shall be</span> strong as iron, as iron which subdueth all things, even as iron cutteth down every tree." It is evident that the translator has read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span> ('<span class="accented">illan</span>), "a tree," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> ('<span class="accented">illeen</span>), "these." The last clause is due to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;</span> (<span class="accented">vetayroa</span>') being written with the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>: <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5e2;</span>; however, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">vav</span>) is not unlike, in ancient Aramaic script, to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">kaph</span>), although <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">lamed</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> not like <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">tau</span>), yet the phrase <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> would carry the reader over every obstacle. Theodotion differs less from the Massoretic," The fourth kingdom is that which shall be as strong as iron, just as (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) iron beateth small and subdueth all things, thus shall it beat small and subdue all things." It may be observed that the clause, "and as iron breaketh all these," is omitted from the text. It certainly appears to be an addition, indeed, has the look of a "doublet." This view is confirmed by the fact that the Peshitta also omits this clause. The Peshitta rendering is," The fourth kingdom shall be strong like iron, and even as iron crushes and bruises all, thus even it shall beat small and subdue all." The Vulgate rendering also omits a clause, "And the fourth kingdom shall be like iron, as iron beats small and subdues all things, it shall beat small (<span class="accented">comminuet</span>) all these." For these grounds we feel inclined to regard the clause in question as an explanatory note, which has slipped into the text. Before we leave the consideration of the text, we must observe that the word for "fourth" assumes the Syriac, or Eastern Aramaic form, not the form in Chaldee, or Western Aramaic. That empire which was represented by the basest of the four metals, and occupied the lowest position in the figure, is that which is the most powerful. When we go back we find brass is the next in point of hardness and strength; it is the third, and of it, at all events, if not also of that which preceded it, it is said that "it shall bear rule over all the earth." The inferiority indicated by the metals and by the position occupied in the image, did not indicate inferiority in power or in extent of dominion. An interesting theory has been formed by Dr. Bonnar ('Great Interregnum'), that this degeneration was one of type. The monarchy as exhibited in Babylon, especially when the monarch was a man of genius, as was Nebuchadnezzar, was likest to the rule of the Almighty over the world: his authority was without limit, direct and absolute over every one subject to his sceptre The Medo-Persian monarchy had much of the Babylonian absoluteness, but there were, if Herodotus is to be trusted, the peers of the crown, and, above all, there were the satraps, with their almost independent position in respect to the central power. The third, in our author's opinion, the Hellenic, had the monarchy limited, not only by numerous compeers, as the king in Antioch was balanced by the kings in Alexandria and Pergamus, not to speak of the monarchs of Parthia, but also by the autonomous cities with the semblance of freedom. The fourth, the Roman, was yet further removed from the old Divine-right monarchy of the Babylonian type. At their first intercourse with the Jews the Romans were Republicans. Their first conquest of Judaea was made by Pompey, the general of the Republic. To the last the emperor, whatever his power, was still theoretically the first magistrate of a republic. The feet and toes of mingled clay and iron, he held, were modern constitutional monarchies - monarchies built upon democracy and the will of the people. All this is doomed to be overthrown by the coming of the <span class="accented">Messianic</span> kingdom. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:31-45 This image represented the kingdoms of the earth, that should successively rule the nations, and influence the affairs of the Jewish church. 1. The head of gold signified the Chaldean empire, then in being. 2. The breast and arms of silver signified the empire of the Medes and Persians. 3. The belly and thighs of brass signified the Grecian empire, founded by Alexander. 4. The legs and feet of iron signified the Roman empire. The Roman empire branched into ten kingdoms, as the toes of these feet. Some were weak as clay, others strong as iron. Endeavours have often been used to unite them, for strengthening the empire, but in vain. The stone cut out without hands, represented the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, which should be set up in the kingdoms of the world, upon the ruins of Satan's kingdom in them. This was the Stone which the builders refused, because it was not cut out by their hands, but it is become the head stone of the corner. Of the increase of Christ's government and peace there shall be no end. The Lord shall reign, not only to the end of time, but when time and days shall be no more. As far as events have gone, the fulfilling this prophetic vision has been most exact and undeniable; future ages shall witness this Stone destroying the image, and filling the whole earth.</body></html>
