Observe, however, that the stone did not crush the head, breast, or loins of the body. These became fragments by falling when the feet were broken.

The versions arc closer to the Massoretic than our Authorized Version, as they all give more prominence to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">kahadah</span>), "at once." It is rendered "together." The LXX. renders <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>; Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span> the Peshitta repeats the word; and Jerome renders <span class="accented">pariter.</span> Theedotion changes the order somewhat, for the sake of making it more symmetrical. The rendering of the LXX. is in some respects different from the natural sense of the Massoretic text, but not so much so as to require us to presume a radically different text: "Then the iron, and the clay, etc., became fragments, and they were smaller than the chaff of the threshing-floor." We have this verse also in the Itala, preserved to us in Tertullian, but it does not differ from Jerome seriously. It would follow naturally enough if the mighty image were so smitten on its weak and fragile feet, that it would come crashing to the earth; but more happened than this. As the monarch looked, in falling, the various parts of the image, as they fell in a heap, became broken, nay, triturated - they became as the dust or chaff of the summer threshing-floor. Summer is the dead time in the East; harvest is over by the end of June, and the threshing of corn then commences. All this huge statue was reduced to particles as small and light as the chaff that is beaten off the grain by the threshing instruments of those days - feet of oxen or wheel of cart. Chaff is a favourite symbol for lightness and worthlessness. In the first psalm the wicked are compared to chaff; so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28.htm">Psalm 28</a>. In Hosea, where he speaks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-3.htm">Hosea 13:3</a>) of Israel's <span class="accented">sins</span>, he <span class="accented">says</span>, "Ephraim shall be like the chaff of the threshing-floor." Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15, 16</a>) speaks of Jacob getting new threshing instruments to thresh the mountains, and make them small as chaff. It may be noted that the word here translated "chaff" only occurs here. The word does not appear in the Targums, instead of which is used <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e6;</span> (<span class="accented">motz</span>), the Hebrew word. In Syriac, again, in the Peshitta, it occurs frequently, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-15.htm">Isaiah 40:15</a> - another sign, slight in itself, of the Eastern origin of the Book of Daniel. The fact that the word occurred in Daniel would have a tendency to preserve it if in use when Daniel was published, or introduce it if it were not. Yet, as we have said, it does not appear in the Targums. It does appear in Syriac, the language of a people who, as not Jews, would presumably not be familiar with Daniel. The word for "threshing-floor," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">iddrei</span>), is also one that does not appear in the Targums, but it does appear in the Peshitta. Jensen suggests an Assyrian etymology, but Brockelmann marks this doubtful; Lagarde suggests a Persian etymology, also marked doubtful. Whichever etymology holds bears out the Eastern origin of the book. The Targums represent the older Aramaic of Palestine. If Daniel were a book originating in Palestine, the Persian words appearing in it might also be expected to appear in the Targums. <span class="cmt_word">And the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth</span>. The LXX. rendering is, "And the wind carried them away, so that there was nothing left of them, and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and smote the whole earth." The first portion of this is a fairly correct rendering of our present Massoretic text. On the other hand, the latter clause implies that the translator had before him, or imagined he had, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5ea;</span>, but <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d7;&#x5ea;</span>; not impossibly <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5ea;</span> might be written without the silent a; thus, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5ea;</span>, as in the Peshitta. In that case the mistake might easily be made. Behrmann remarks on the vocalization of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5ea;</span> in this passage being the same as <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d7;&#x5ea;</span>, but does not remark that it is written defectively in Syriac. The sense in the Massoretic text is much better than that implied in this reading. Theodotion's rendering differs in the first clause of this portion of the present verse, "And the abundance (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) of wind carried it away, and place was not found for them: and the stone, when it had smitten (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) the image, became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth." The rendering "multitude" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is due to reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>. This form of the plural of the demonstrative pronoun is the commoner in Biblical Aramaic, but does not appear in the Targums nor the Peshitta. It is akin to the Mandaitic <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>. Neither the Peshitta nor the Vulgate presents any peculiarities of rendering. All this mass that had formed the image, though it had been gold, silver, brass, and iron, yet was so ground down - had become reduced to particles so small, that the wind carried them away. So scattered were they that they collected in no special place, so that one could say, "This is the image." The figure is still that of the threshing-floor; the wind, blowing on the grain that is lifted up before it, carries away the chaff, but, search as one may, the chaff, once blown away, cannot be found. A more remarkable thing now takes place - the stone that, bounding down the mountainside, had smitten the image on the feet, so that it fell and became as dust, now grows apace, overtopping the utmost height the image had attained, overtopping the mountain from which it had been cut. Not only did it grow in height, but, as it increased in height, its base broadened till the whole earth was filled with it. There seems to be a reference here to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>, "<span class="accented">The</span> mountain of the Lord's house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it." As the monarch gazes in his dream, the change is completed, the huge image, with its glittering head and gleaming breast, its polished thighs and legs of iron, its unseemly feet that inspired terror by its very appearance, had utterly disappeared, and its place was occupied by a mountain, huge but peaceful, on which the flocks might browse and trees might grow. It may be noted, though not as of importance, that the material of the mountain is most akin with that of the weak clay of which the feet of the image were largely composed. Such, then, is the dream which Nebuchadnezzar had seen, and which the prophet now presented once more before him. We must, however, glance at the picture presented by the reading of the LXX. To the translator the picture evidently present was that of a stone descending from the mountain, and increasing in momentum as it descends; but this stone further increases in size, till before its tremendous strokes and rebounds the very solid earth quakes. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:31-45 This image represented the kingdoms of the earth, that should successively rule the nations, and influence the affairs of the Jewish church. 1. The head of gold signified the Chaldean empire, then in being. 2. The breast and arms of silver signified the empire of the Medes and Persians. 3. The belly and thighs of brass signified the Grecian empire, founded by Alexander. 4. The legs and feet of iron signified the Roman empire. The Roman empire branched into ten kingdoms, as the toes of these feet. Some were weak as clay, others strong as iron. Endeavours have often been used to unite them, for strengthening the empire, but in vain. The stone cut out without hands, represented the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, which should be set up in the kingdoms of the world, upon the ruins of Satan's kingdom in them. This was the Stone which the builders refused, because it was not cut out by their hands, but it is become the head stone of the corner. Of the increase of Christ's government and peace there shall be no end. The Lord shall reign, not only to the end of time, but when time and days shall be no more. As far as events have gone, the fulfilling this prophetic vision has been most exact and undeniable; future ages shall witness this Stone destroying the image, and filling the whole earth.</body></html>
