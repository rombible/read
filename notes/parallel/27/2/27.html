The differences between this and the Septuagint are but slight and unimportant. To render it literally, the LXX. is, "Daniel, having spoken out in the presence of the king, said, The mystery which the king saw is nut the showing of the wise men, the astrologers, the sorcerers, the magicians." There seems to have been a confusion between <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> ('<span class="accented">anah</span>), "to answer," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">tzenah</span>), "to cry out;" the latter word is unsuitable in the present connection. The change from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span> to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d6;&#x5d4;</span> is unlikely to have been the result of any mistake in the writing of the original. It may have been the Greek scribe who misread <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> into <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. Theodotion and the Peshitta present no peculiarities worthy of notice. Jerome translates <span class="accented">asbshaphim</span> by magi, as usual, following the Peshitta. It is to be observed that here again we have a list of the different <span class="accented">classes</span> of <span class="accented">soothsayers</span>, and the class of Chaldeans is omitted, as also those marked as <span class="accented">mecashphim</span> in ver. 2; instead, occupying the same place in the catalogue, is <span class="accented">gazrin.</span> This may have been the original word, as evidently the real meaning was not known either in Egypt or Asia Minor, as both the LXX. and Theodotion transfer the word. The Peshitta translates this word by <span class="accented">asuphe</span>, in reality the corresponding one to the second word in the Chaldee. This would seem to show that the word had disappeared from Eastern as well as Western Aramaic. It is derived from <span class="accented">gezar</span>, "to eat." Behrmann ('Das Buch Daniel') derives it thus, and <span class="accented">says</span> that it refers to the fact that those who studied nativities divided the heavens into <span class="accented">sectiones</span> or <span class="accented">segmenta.</span> This was precisely what the "Chaldeans" of classic times did; hence it is quite a possible thing that Chaldeans was inserted in some Greek translations, and got into the Aramaic from the Greek. The word does not seem to be used for , astrologers" in the Talmud. The occasion of Daniel's narrating the impotence of the other wise men in presence of the task set them by the king is that probably he recognized the accent of surprise in the king's tone. As if he said, "Yes, it is perfectly true, what none of these wise men could do, I, a mere youth, undertake to do." There is nothing of contempt for them in this, as is seen in the following verse. There may be a shade of rebuke implied to the king, who had demanded from men what they could not do. They had declared that only the gods could reveal this to the king. And what Daniel says is not in opposition to this, but confirmatory of it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:24-30 Daniel takes away the king's opinion of his magicians and soothsayers. The insufficiency of creatures should drive us to the all-sufficiency of the Creator. There is One who can do that for us, and make known that to us, which none on earth can, particularly the work of redemption, and the secret designs of God's love to us therein. Daniel confirmed the king in his opinion, that the dream was of great consequence, relating to the affairs and changes of this lower world. Let those whom God has highly favoured and honoured, lay aside all opinion of their own wisdom and worthiness, that the Lord alone may be praised for the good they have and do.</body></html>
