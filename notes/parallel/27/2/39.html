or, in other words, Nebuchadnezzar was identified with his kingdom (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-5.htm" title="And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus to it, Arise, devour much flesh.">Daniel 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-3.htm" title="Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.">Daniel 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-20.htm" title="The ram which you saw having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.">Daniel 8:20</a>). The second kingdom is the Medo-Persian (as appears more fully below, <span class= "ital">Exc.</span> E). The inferiority is to be found in the divided character of that empire, as compared with the massive solidity of its predecessor. This is signified in the image, partly by the inferiority of the metal, silver instead of gold, and partly by the symbol of division, the <span class= "ital">two</span> breasts opposed to the <span class= "ital">one</span> head. It must not be forgotten that in other respects, such as extent of territory and duration of empire, the Medo-Persian far exceeded the Babylonian kingdom.<p><span class= "bld">Another third.</span>--The metal implies a certain inferiority, but the phrase "shall bear rule over the whole earth" speaks of an empire that extended further than the preceding. This is the Graeco-Macedonian Empire (see <span class= "ital">Exc.</span> E, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-6.htm" title="After this I beheld, and see another, like a leopard, which had on the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.">Daniel 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/8-5.htm" title="And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.">Daniel 8:5-7</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</span> None of the versions presents any difficulties, or gives occasion for any remark, save the Vulgate, which inserts <span class="accented">argenteum</span>, as if reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5e1;&#x5e4;</span>. The word used, "kingdom," not "king," shows, without possibility of reasonable dispute, that in identifying Nebuchadnezzar with the head of gold, the reference is not to him per-serially, but to him as representing his dynasty. The next dynasty is said to be inferior, that is to <span class="accented">say</span>, nearer the ground <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">ar'a</span>), which is certainly true of the shoulders in relation to the head. Not only does the inferior metal imply inferiority, but the inferior position dues so also. The metal is omitted here, but stated in the next clause, <span class="accented">Another third kingdom of brass</span>, <span class="accented">which shall bear rule over all the earth.</span> The metal is here referred to, but not the position; there is no need to say it is inferior - that is implied when it is said to be a kingdom of brass. We need only refer to what we have said above, as to the fact that "brass" here really means "copper." As the inferiority stated in the first clause is omitted in the second, so the statement made at the end, which grammatically applies only to the third kingdom, applies also to the second. It is only as, in a sense, bearing rule over the whole earth, that any monarchy comes into this statue at all. When we look at these two, we find certainly the two arms suggesting and rendering emphatic a twofoldness of some sort in this power. The fact that, in the description of the statue, the word translated "belly" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;</span>) is plural, suggests, along with the <span class="accented">two</span> thighs, the idea of four-foldness. Faintly is this suggestion made, but the exigencies of the figure must be considered. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:31-45 This image represented the kingdoms of the earth, that should successively rule the nations, and influence the affairs of the Jewish church. 1. The head of gold signified the Chaldean empire, then in being. 2. The breast and arms of silver signified the empire of the Medes and Persians. 3. The belly and thighs of brass signified the Grecian empire, founded by Alexander. 4. The legs and feet of iron signified the Roman empire. The Roman empire branched into ten kingdoms, as the toes of these feet. Some were weak as clay, others strong as iron. Endeavours have often been used to unite them, for strengthening the empire, but in vain. The stone cut out without hands, represented the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, which should be set up in the kingdoms of the world, upon the ruins of Satan's kingdom in them. This was the Stone which the builders refused, because it was not cut out by their hands, but it is become the head stone of the corner. Of the increase of Christ's government and peace there shall be no end. The Lord shall reign, not only to the end of time, but when time and days shall be no more. As far as events have gone, the fulfilling this prophetic vision has been most exact and undeniable; future ages shall witness this Stone destroying the image, and filling the whole earth.</body></html>
