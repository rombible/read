The version of Theodotion is in closer accordance with the Massoretic text, only it inserts "captivity" where the LXX. had "nobles," and reads, "from the sons of the captivity of Israel." In this version the name of the chief of the eunuchs is the same as the Massoretic; the word rendered "princes" in the Authorized Version is transliterated <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>. The rendering, "the seed of the kingdom," is more literal than that of the Authorized, "the king's seed" The Peshitta is in close agreement with the Massoretic text, save that, instead of "Ashpenaz," the name of the chief of the eunuchs is written "Aspaz," and the word translated "princes" (<span class="accented">parte-</span>mira) is transliterated <span class="accented">Parthouia</span>, which means literally "Parthians." Symmachus reads <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="accented">The king spake unto Ashpenaz.</span> There is assumed here that there were a large number of Israelitish hostages who would be reckoned captives whenever the conquered state gave cause of suspicion to the regnant power in whose hands the hostages were, and they were possibly eunuchized. It is possible that Nebuchadnezzar wished to use these hostages about the court, in order that, having tasted the pleasure and dignities of the magnificent court of Babylon, their influence would be exercised on their relatives to maintain them in fidelity. The phrase, "spake unto," has. in later Hebrew, the force of "command," especially when followed by an infinitive, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-17.htm">Esther 1:17</a>. As translated in the Authorized Version. the impression conveyed is that of consultation. The name "Ash-penaz" has caused much discussion. As it stands, it is not Assyrian or Babylonian. The form it has suggests a Persian etymology, and on this fact, along with other similar alleged facts, an argument against the authenticity of Daniel has been based. One derivation would make it <span class="accented">ashpa</span>, "a horse;" <span class="accented">nasa</span>, "a nose," "horse nose" - by no means an impossible personal name for a Persian or Median. In one or two cuneiform inscriptions of the Persian period the name occurs. Nothing can be built on this, as in the Septuagint the name is given as <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span>: in the Peshitta it becomes "<span class="accented">Ash-paz</span>," as we have mentioned above. It would be easily possible to derive" Ashpaz" from "Ashpenaz," or <span class="accented">vice versa</span>; but there seems no relation between <span class="accented">Abiesdri</span> and either. By some, as Hitzig, the name has been identified with "Ashkenaz" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-3.htm">Genesis 10:3</a>), and that again derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span>, "the cord of the testicle," and has, a Sanskrit root, "to destroy," and therefore the name would simply be "eunuch." Over and above the general improbability that is always present in regard to etymologies which imply the word in question to be a hybrid word, there is the improbability that one eunuch would receive a name applicable to the whole class of which he was a member. The name, as it appears in the Septuagint, is, as we have said, totally unconnected with that in the Massoretic text, but both may have sprung from some common source. Thus the French word <span class="accented">eveque</span> has not a single letter in common with "bishop," yet both words are derived from <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The changes that a name might undergo in passing from any language, even a cognate one, into Hebrew wine very great; thus <span class="accented">Assur-bani-pal</span> became "Asnapper." Lenormant has endeavoured to recover the name in the present case. The process he has followed is the somewhat mechanical one of combining the two names, as if we were to strive to reach Asshur-bani-pal item a combination of "Asnapper" and "Sar-danapalus." He arrives at the name <span class="accented">Ash-ben-azur</span>, which is a possible Babylonian name. Professor Fuller has suggested <span class="accented">Aba-</span>(<span class="accented">i</span>)<span class="accented">-istar</span>, "the astronomer of the goddess Ishtar." The main objection to this is that it is drawn solely from the Septuagint Version. If we look at the tendency exhibited by the Hebrew equivalents of Babylonian names, we find that shortening was one that was nearly invariably present, as <span class="accented">Asshur-akhi-iddin na</span> became <span class="accented">Esarhaddon</span>, and <span class="accented">Sin-akhi-irba</span> became <span class="accented">Sanherib.</span> The only exception to this shortening process which occurs to us is <span class="accented">Brodach</span> for <span class="accented">Marduk</span>, and even it is scarcely an exception. Next there is a tendency, which Hebrew shares with other languages, of suiting a foreign word to the genius of the language. Hence we find "Ashpenaz" has such a close resemblance to "Ashkenaz" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-3.htm">Genesis 10:3</a>, and that "Abiesdri" is identical with the form "Abiezer" - the name of the father of Gideon - assumes in the Septuagint. Judging from "Asnapper," the name might even begin with <span class="accented">Asshur</span>, only that, as <span class="accented">Asshur</span> was the national god of the Ninevites, names which contained the name of that divinity are rare in Babylon. The first element in the word might not impossibly be <span class="accented">ablu</span>, "son." The final element seems certainly to have been <span class="accented">ezer</span> or <span class="accented">utzur.</span> As to the office he tided in the court of Nebuchadnezzar, "the master of eunuchs," the name of the office in the text is <span class="accented">Rab-Sarisim</span>, which occurs in a slightly different form in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a>, along with <span class="accented">Rab-Shakeh</span>, as if it were a proper name. From the fact that persons thus mutilated were employed in Eastern courts, the word became equivalent to "officer;" hence we find Petiphar is called <span class="accented">saris</span>, or "eunuch;" yet he had a wife. It therefore may be doubted whether Daniel and his companions are to be understood as placed in that condition. The title here given - <span class="accented">Rab-Sarisim - becomes Sar-Sarisim</span> in vers. 7 and 10, <span class="accented">Sat</span> being the Hebrew equivalent of the more Babylonian <span class="accented">Rab.</span> It is also Aramaic. <span class="accented">That he should bring certain of the children of Israel</span>, <span class="accented">and of the king's seed</span>, <span class="accented">and of the princes.</span> It may be doubted at first sight whether these may not be separate classes - a view that seems to have been taken by most of the old translators, or whether the first class, "the children of Israel," does not include the two classes that follow. The rendering <span class="accented">part'mim</span>, as "Parthians," adopted by Symmachus and the Peshitta, would make a contrast between "the children of Israel" and "the Parthians." That, however, is utterly unlikely. Were that translation the true one, a strong argument could be advanced for the late origin of Daniel. The fact that the text before Symmachus and the Peshitta translator admitted of that translation shows how far the tendency to modify the text into suitability with the knowledge of the scribe had gone, and therefore how little weight ought to be given to lateness of individual words. According to the LXX. and Theodotion, there is a word awanting in the first clause; the Septuagint translator would supply "nobles" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) "from the nobles of Israel." Theodotion renders, "from the sons of the Captivity of Israel." If the sentence ran <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span>, one might understand how it could be read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span>; the natural phrase for this is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span>, but that would not explain the LXX. rendering. The name "Israel" is the covenant name of the whole nation, equally applicable to the southern and to the northern kingdoms. All the more so that the captivity of Judah contained members of three other tribes besides that of Judah, namely, those of Benjamin and Simeon an l Levi. Further, Josiah seems to have extended the bounds of the Davidic kingdom to embrace the remnant of the ten tribes (<a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/2_chronicles/34-6.htm">2 Chronicles 34:6, 9</a>), therefore his sons would claim the same boundaries, and therefore hostages might be taken by Nebuchadnezzar from them to Babylon. <span class="accented">And of the king's seed and of the princes.</span> The two "ands" might be rendered "both... and," or "alike ... and." The king's seed means, literally, "the seed of the kingdom," as it is translated by Theodotion. The phrase, "children of the kingdom," is applied by our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-12.htm">Matthew 8:12</a>) to all the Jews, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-38.htm">Matthew 13:38</a> to the members of the true Israel - perhaps with a latent reference to the children of the true King thus in captivity to the beggarly elements of this world, compelled to stand as servants in the court of Mammon, of which Nebuchadnezzar may well be the type. The word <span class="accented">partemim</span> is one which has caused difficulty; it only occurs here, and twice in Esther (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-3.htm">Esther 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/6-9.htm">Esther 6:9</a>). In these passages it is rendered by the Peshitta as here, <span class="accented">Parthouia</span>, "Parthians." It would seem that the Septuagint translator had before him, not <span class="accented">partemin</span>, but <span class="accented">bahureem</span>, connecting it with <span class="accented">yeladeem</span>," children" (youths), the opening word of the succeeding vers,., In Esther the word <span class="accented">part&deg;mim</span> is applied to a special class of nobles among the Persians, and certainly was not applied to the princes of Judah. Theodotion does not understand what it means, and so transliterates it <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>. Symmachus and the Peshitta make it "Parthians;" the Targum on Esther makes the same blunder. The LXX. Version of Esther renders it <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, as if it were connected with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>. It certainly has Zend (<span class="accented">frathema</span>) and Pehlevi (<span class="accented">pardun</span>) congeners, so it may have come over from Aryan sources into the Babylonian. Equally certainly it has disappeared from Aramaic Eastern and Western. If <span class="accented">partemim</span> is to be held as part of the original text, it must belong to a period before the Greek domination, as the meaning of the word had disappeared by that time. It might, on the other hand, have been a word in the Babylonian court, or, again, a copyist might have inserted it as a more known word than that originally in the text. This latter, we think, is the probable solution. If the division of the verses had in the Massoretic become deranged, then <span class="accented">bahureem</span> would be unintelligible, standing, as it would, at the end of the verse. In Egypt this derangement did not take place, and hence <span class="accented">bahureem</span> was retained. <span class="accented">Children in whom was no blemish.</span> There is no limit to the age implied in <span class="accented">yeled</span>, the word the plural of which is translated "children;" thus to young counsellors who had been brought up with Rehoboam are called <span class="accented">yeladeem.</span> As they had been brought up with Rehoboam, they were of the same age with him, yet he was forty-one years old when he ascended the throne. Joseph is called <span class="accented">yeled</span> when he was at least seventeen, and Ishmael when he was probably sixteen. Benjamin is called <span class="accented">yeled</span> when he was nearly, if not quite, thirty years old; it is said of him immediately before he went down to Egypt, and then he was the father of ten sons. It is used also of new-born infants (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-17.htm">Exodus 1:17</a>). When we look at the various qualifications they were to possess <span class="accented">- skilful in all wisdom</span>, <span class="accented">cunning in knowledge</span>, <span class="accented">understanding science -</span> sixteen to eighteen seems the lowest limit we can set. Aben Ezra comes to the conclusion that they were fourteen when they came to Babylon; that, however, even when all allowance is made for the precocity of warm climates, seems too low. On the whole, we may say that Daniel, when he was taken to Babylon, was the same age as Joseph when he went down into Egypt. The Septuagint rendering (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) supports our view. We may note that this command to Ashpenaz was in all likelihood given at Jerusalem. <span class="accented">In whom was no blemish</span>, <span class="accented">but well-secured.</span> If we may judge of the taste of the Babylonians and Assyrians from the sculptures that have come down to us, they had a high standard of personal appearance - especially fine in appearance are the eunuchs that stand before the king. The word <span class="accented">moom</span>, "blemish," is used of the priesthood; presence of a "blemish" excluded from the priesthood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-17.htm">Leviticus 21:17</a>). It is used of Absalom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-25.htm">2 Samuel 14:25</a>); it is equivalent in meaning to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, which not impossibly was derived from some early form of this word; <span class="accented">tovay mar'eh</span>," goodly in appearance," almost identical with our colloquial "good-looking." <span class="accented">Skilful in all wisdom.</span> The word "wisdom" has, in general, a somewhat technical meaning in Hebrew, "skill in interpreting riddles and framing proverbs." It became widened in meaning in certain cases, as we see in the description of wisdom in the beginning of Proverbs and <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/job/28.htm">Job 28</a>. Yet wider is the sphere given to it in Ecclesiasticus and the Book of Wisdom. The word translated "skilful," <span class="accented">maskileem</span>, means, in the first instance, "attending to;" then, the result of this attention, especially when followed by the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;</span>, "in," The LXX. suits this, "skilled in all wisdom." Theodotion renders, "understanding (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) in all wisdom." Professor Bevan would render <span class="accented">maskil</span>, "intelligent;" Hitzig adopts Luther's <span class="accented">einsichtig in allerlei Wissenschaft</span>, "intelligent in every kind of science," adding, "that is, they would be were they placed in suitable circumstances." He objects to De Wette rendering "experienced," as unsuitable to boys. <span class="accented">Cunning in knowledge</span>; literally, <span class="accented">knowing knowledge.</span> The distinction is here between the faculty of intelligence and the actual acquirements. It might be rendered "intelligent and well-educated" - a view that is supported by the Septuagint rendering (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>)<span class="accented">. Understanding science</span>; "discriminating knowledge," as it is rendered in Theodotion. The Septuagint translator had another text before him; instead of reading <span class="accented">mebine madda</span>, he had before him <span class="accented">mebinim yod'eem</span>, that is to say, he divided the letters differently, so that he read it along with <span class="accented">mebine</span>, and had <span class="accented">a yod</span> inserted after it, not as connected, but as separate. The word <span class="accented">madda</span> <span class="accented">is</span> late, found in Chronicles and Ecclesiastes, and as Aramaic well known; the change in the Septuagint must have been due to a different reading. The fact that <span class="accented">madda</span> <span class="accented">is</span> late, and was <span class="accented">not</span> in the Septuagint text, throws a suspicion on all the late words in Daniel, as all of them may be due to the same modernizing tendency. The phrase, according to the Septuagint reading, may be rendered, "having good powers of discrimination and acquisition." <span class="accented">And such as had the ability in them to stand in the king's palace.</span> The word used for "ability" (<span class="accented">koh</span>) usually means "physical strength," as of Samson (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-6.htm">Judges 16:6</a>), applied to animals as of the unicorn (wild ox) (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-11.htm">Job 39:11</a>). Here, however, it refers rather to mental capacity. The idea is that those should be chosen who showed signs of future ability, and therefore afforded a probability that they would be of use in the royal council-chamber. The translator of the Septuagint Version puts a point after <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, and unites the two following clauses under it. <span class="accented">And whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans</span>. The LXX. renders, "to teach them letters and the Chaldean dialect." There were three tongues used in Babylon. There was the Aramaic of ordinary business and diplomacy, called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-26.htm">2 Kings 18:26</a> "the Syrian language," and in this book (ch. Daniel 2:4) "Syriack." This was commonly understood, as is shown by the fact that tablets have been found inscribed in Assyrian, but having a docquet behind in Aramaic, telling the contents. Next there was the Assyrian, a Shemitic tongue, cognate with Hebrew, though further removed from it than Aramaic is. This is the language of historic and legal documents, much as Norman French was for long the language of our Acts of Parliament, while the people spoke a tongue not far removed from our modern English. The system of writing was cumbrous in the highest degree, the same sign standing for several different words, and the same word represented by several different signs. As a spoken language &#8212; if it ever were a spoken tongue &#8212; it was cumbrous also. It was eminently a monumental tongue. Lastly, there was Accadian, the sacred tongue, a language belonging to a different class from the Aramaic and Assyrian. In it the great bulk of the magical formulae and ritual directions of Babylon and Nineveh were written. In the huge library of Asshurbanipal, now in the British Museum, a large portion is composed of translations of those Accadian texts. A number of syllabaries have also been found, which enable scholars to investigate this antique tongue. It seems not impossible that Accadian was meant by the learning (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">sepher</span>, "book") and tongue of the Chaldeans. Their learning involved some astronomy, a great deal of astrology, and not a little magic, incantations, interpretations of dreams and omens. We ourselves, though so far removed both geographically and chronologically from them, feel the effects of their ideas, and enjoy some of the results of their knowledge. We cannot tell whether the Babylonians were the earliest to fix the course of the sun, moon, and planets. At all events, they made observations on the basis of these discoveries; and our week, with its Sunday and Monday, conveys to us still the fact that the Babylonians believed the planets to be seven; the planets strictly so called were associated with deities similar in attributes to those associated with them by the Latin and Teutonic peoples, and the same days were sacred to them in Babylonia and Germany. <span class="accented">The Chaldeans</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">Kasdeem</span>, of the Bible, do not seem to have been originally inhabitants of Babylon. They formed a cluster of clans to the south-west of Babylon, who invaded Babylonia, and occasionally secured the supremacy in the city. The Assyrians had frequent encounters with them, and carried on against them many prolonged wars. The name in the Assyrian monuments is most frequently <span class="accented">Kaldu</span>, from which the Greek <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> comes. It is doubtful whether there is a form <span class="accented">Kassatu</span> to explain the Hebrew term. In the days of Nabo-polassar, the Chaldeans being supreme in Babylonia, all the inhabitants of that province may have been called Chaldeans. Latterly there was a restricted use of the term, due to the great attention paid in Babylonia to astrology. It is doubtful whether this restricted use of the word occurred in the genuine Daniel, from which our canonical Daniel has sprung. Certainly Daniel, and those hostages selected with him, were to be educated so as to become member's of this sacred college of augurs and astrologers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, took Jerusalem, and carried whom and what he pleased away. From this first captivity, most think the seventy years are to be dated. It is the interest of princes to employ wise men; and it is their wisdom to find out and train up such. Nebuchadnezzar ordered that these chosen youths should be taught. All their Hebrew names had something of God in them; but to make them forget the God of their fathers, the Guide of their youth, the heathen gave them names that savoured of idolatry. It is painful to reflect how often public education tends to corrupt the principles and morals.</body></html>
