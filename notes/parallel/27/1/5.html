The only thing to be noticed in the LXX. Version of this verse is the fact that <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> is taken to mean "give a portion" - a meaning which seems to be implied in <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-10.htm">Nehemiah 8:10</a>), hence the translation <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. Further, the translator must have had <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-29.htm">2 Kings 25:29</a>. The mysterious <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;</span> (<span class="accented">path-bag</span>), translated "meat," has caused differences of rendering. The Syriac Peshitta transfers it. Professor Bevan speaks as if it were common in Syriac, but Castell gives no reference beyond Daniel. (Brockei-mann adds, Ephrem Syrus, Isaac Antiochenus, Bar Hebraeus). It is to be observed that the Syriac form of the word has <span class="accented">teth</span>, not <span class="accented">tan</span>, for the second radical. This is a change that would not likely take place had the Hebrew form been the original, whereas from the fact that <span class="accented">path</span> means in Hebrew "a portion," if the Hebrew were derived from the Syriac the change would be intelligible. It is confounded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-26.htm">Daniel 11:26</a> with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">pathura</span>), "a table." It seems not improbable that both the LXX. and Theodotion read <span class="accented">pathura.</span> The word <span class="accented">path-bag</span> does not seem to have been known in Palestine; it does not occur in Chaldee, but does in Syriac. This is intelligible if the chapter before us is condensation from a Syriac original rendered into Hebrew: the word <span class="accented">path-bag</span>, being unintelligible, is transferred. The etymology of the word is alleged to be Persian, but on this assumption it is a matter of dispute what that etymology is. One derivation is from <span class="accented">pad</span> or fad, "father" or "prince," or <span class="accented">pat</span> or <span class="accented">fat</span>, idol,' and <span class="accented">bag</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;</span>), food; another is from <span class="accented">pati-bhagu</span>, "a portion." The question is complicated by the fact that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-7.htm">Ezekiel 25:7</a> we have in the K'tbib <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;</span> (bag), meaning "food." In that case <span class="accented">path-bag</span> would mean "a portion of food." The reading of the K'thib is not supported by the versions. In Daniel the word simply means "food," such as was supplied to the king's table. We see in the slabs from the palace of Kou-youn-jik the nature of a royal feast. Animal food predominated. We cannot avoid referring to a singular argumentative axiom implied in all the <span class="accented">discussions</span> on Daniel. Critics seem to think that when they prove that certain words in Daniel are Persian, they thus prove Daniel was written nearly a couple of centuries after the Persian domination had disappeared. <span class="accented">Of the wine which he drank.</span> It is to be noted that there is a restriction. The wine supplied was the wine which the king drank - wine of which an oblation had been offered to idols. In thus bringing up hostages at his own table, Nebuchadnezzar was following a practice which has continued down to our own day. The son of Theodore of Magdala was brought up at the court of our queen. It was the regular practice, as we know, in Imperial Rome. Sennacherib speaks of Belibus, whom he made deputy-king in Babylon, as brought up "as a little dog at his table" (Bellino Cylinder, Sehrader, vol. 2. p. 32, Engl, trans.). <span class="accented">So nourishing them three years.</span> This was the period during which the education of a Persian youth was continued. It is probable, as we have seen, that these youths were about sixteen or seventeen. At the end of three years they would still be very young. The grammatical connection of the word <span class="accented">legaddelam is</span> somewhat singular. The Septuagint reading probably had the first word in this verse in the infinitive also. This is more grammatical, as it brings the whole under the regimen of the opening clause of ver. 3. The force of the word before us is represented in "bringing up." The verb in its simple form means "to be strong," "to be great," hence in the intensive form before us, "to make great," "to bring up." <span class="accented">That at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</span> "Standing before the king" means usually becoming members of the council of the monarch, but in the present instance this does not seem to be the meaning. They were to be presented before the king, and in his presence they were to be examined. They were, then, possibly to be admitted into the college of astrologers and soothsayers, but only in lowly grade. Irrespective of the fact that they would at the latest be twenty or twenty-one when this season of education was over, an(t, even making all allowance for Eastern precocity, this is too young an age for being a member of a royal privy council. But the next chapter relates an event which appears to be the occasion when they stood before the king, for they were not summoned with the wise men to the king's presence to interpret his dream. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, took Jerusalem, and carried whom and what he pleased away. From this first captivity, most think the seventy years are to be dated. It is the interest of princes to employ wise men; and it is their wisdom to find out and train up such. Nebuchadnezzar ordered that these chosen youths should be taught. All their Hebrew names had something of God in them; but to make them forget the God of their fathers, the Guide of their youth, the heathen gave them names that savoured of idolatry. It is painful to reflect how often public education tends to corrupt the principles and morals.</body></html>
