We shall consider the differences of the versions from the Massoretic below. The word (<span class="accented">sar</span>) for "prince" is continued from the preceding verse, <span class="accented">I fear.</span> In the Massoretic text, the word is not a verb, but an adjective. If the phrase were rendered "I am afraid," this would represent the construction, it is one that is specially frequent with this adjective; it resembles the construction so common in Aramaic of participle with pronoun where an ordinary preterite or imperfect would be used in Hebrew. <span class="accented">Your meat and your drink.</span> In this phrase the enigmatic word <span class="accented">path-bag</span> has disappeared; <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">ma'achal</span>), the ordinary word for "food," has replaced it. <span class="accented">For why should he see your face.</span> The construction here is decidedly Aramaic, and resembles a word-for-word rendering from an Aramaic original. The Targumic phrase here is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">deelma</span>) (Onkelos, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-3.htm">Genesis 3:3</a>). The Peshitta rendering here is <span class="accented">dalton.</span> The construction occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-7.htm">Song of Solomon 1:7</a>, <span class="accented">shallama</span>, only with the northern shortened relative. <span class="accented">In worse liking.</span> The word <span class="accented">zo'apheem</span> means "sad," "troubled" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-6.htm">Genesis 40:6</a>); the verb from which it comes means "to be angry" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-19.htm">2 Chronicles 26:19</a>). It is to be noted that the Septuagint here has two renderings, probably a case of "doublet." The first <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> may refer to the mental confusion or sadness that they might be in if on account of their poor nourishment they were unable to answer the king's questions; the second, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;</span>, "weak," may refer to the body: <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> Theodotion's rendering, which may be rendered "scowling" (it is used along with <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, Plato, 'Syrup.'). The Peshitta has <span class="accented">m'karan</span>, "ashamed;" that they would feel shame were they much inferior in looks or acquirements to their neighbours would be natural. The intimate connection between food and good looks and good mental qualities is well known as one much held, especially in ancient days. <span class="accented">Than the children of your sort. Keqilkem</span>; this word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span>, is maintained by Professor Bevan to be unused in early Hebrew in the sense of "generation" or "age" Furst would regard the name Abigail as exhibiting the word as existing in early times. The only difficulty in this is that the name may have another derivation. The real meaning of the word in this connection is "a circle;" hence then a revolution of the heavens. It is explained by Buxtorf as meaning "constellation, planet;" <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>, "son of his star" - born under the same constellation, contemporary. The Syriac paraphrases the word, and renders "of your year." Theodotion renders <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>, "of like age." When we turn to the Septuagint, we find evidence either that the word was not there at all, or that it was misunderstood; the Septuagint rendering is "than the stranger (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) youths brought up with you (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>)." This is an evident case of doublet. The first that stands in the Greek is <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>: this represents a various reading, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">gad'lu itkem</span>), by no means an impossible reading. The other, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, represents <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">geereem</span>): this is still more like the Massoretic reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5db;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">geelkem</span>). The Massoretic is possibly the reading from which the other two have sprung; if so, it is clear that the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span> has not in this sense been known to either of the two Egyptian translators. It is not Targumic, for Levy has it not in his Lexicon. Professor Bevan says it is Aramaic and Arabic. This, then, is a case where the Aramaic original shines through; the chief of the eunuchs would naturally speak in Aramaic. <span class="accented">Then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.</span> Here again is a word which Professor Bevan declares is late, the word here translated "make me endanger <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">yehigyabetem</span>)." There is no difficulty as to the reading in the versions, save that the Septuagint reads the first person singular instead of the second person plural, in other words, <span class="accented">vehiyyabti</span>, "and I shall endanger," and "my neck," reading, instead of "my head," possibly <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">tzavvari</span>) or <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">maphraqti</span>), the latter reading due to the <span class="accented">mere</span>, the sign of the second person plural being transferred to the following word. It may certainly have been a paraphrase, but the phrase as it stands in the Massoretic seems awkward. <span class="accented">Professor</span> Bevan brings forward this word as Aramaic, and a proof of the lateness of Daniel. If we are correct, it is a case where the Aramaic of the original shines through. The word indubitably occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-7.htm">Ezekiel 18:7</a>. As counsel for the prosecution, Professor Bevan must get rid of this awkward fact. Cornill, one of his colleagues in the case against Daniel, suggests that another word should be read in Ezekiel, and <span class="accented">Professor</span> Bevan agrees, but differs as to the word. There is no indication in any of the versions that there is any uncertainty as to the reading in Ezekiel. It is a most convenient method of getting rid of an awkward fact; little extension of it might make any word one pleased a <span class="accented">hapax legomenon.</span> The critics might have tried the method more reasonably on Daniel than on Ezekiel; but as their brief was against Daniel, that did not occur to them. The picture presented to us in this verse is one that in the <span class="accented">circumstances</span> is full of naturalness. We have, on the one hand, the eager entreaty of the Hebrew youth; the kindly look of the prince, willing to grant anything he possibly can to his favourite, yet hindered by fear for himself, and at the same time a desire that Daniel, his favourite, should stand well with the king. The chief of the eunuchs knew that personal good looks were an important matter with Nebuchadnezzar. If they were badly nourished, these Hebrew youths would be handicapped in their examination before the king. But more, shame at their own appearance would disturb them mentally, even if they were able to study as well on this plain food they desired. If the failure were egregious, then investigation might be demanded, and then the fact that he had transgressed the orders of the king would be a serious offence - the king knew no mercy when enraged. It is to be observed that the chief of the eunuchs first appeals to the self-interest of the youths before him, that they would endanger their own prospects; but as that does not move them, he next tells them that his own life would be endangered. In this case we must remember we have merely a summary, and a very condensed summary, of what was probably a prolonged argument. We have only the heads, and probably the succession of the arguments. It may, perhaps, be regarded as a proof of the authenticity of this speech that two Aramaic words are preserved in it. The Rabsaris most certainly would speak in Aramaic, and technical words such as <span class="accented">geel</span> and <span class="accented">heyyabtem</span> might be retained even in a translation, if there were no word which was quite an exact equivalent. Thus in translations from French or German into English, how frequently are words transferred from the original tongue[ "One-sided" is a case in point. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:8-16 The interest we think we make for ourselves, we must acknowledge to be God's gift. Daniel was still firm to his religion. Whatever they called him, he still held fast the spirit of an Israelite. These youths scrupled concerning the meat, lest it should be sinful. When God's people are in Babylon they need take special care that they partake not of her sins. It is much to the praise of young people, not to covet or seek the delights of sense. Those who would excel in wisdom and piety, must learn betimes to keep the body under. Daniel avoided defiling himself with sin; and we should more fear that than any outward trouble. It is easier to keep temptation at a distance, than to resist it when near. And we cannot better improve our interest in any with whom we have found favour, than to use it to keep us from sin. People will not believe the benefit of avoiding excess, and of a spare diet, nor how much they contribute to the health of the body, unless they try. Conscientious temperance will always do more, even for the comfort of this life, than sinful indulgence.</body></html>
