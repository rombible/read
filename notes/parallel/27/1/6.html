Daniel calls our attention to the fact that the very four whom Providence had endowed with the greatest natural gifts were those by whose constancy and example the king was converted. The names of these four were subsequently changed, with the view of showing that they had become nationalised Chaldee subjects. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-34.htm" title="And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.">2Kings 23:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm" title="And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.">2Kings 24:17</a>.) The name Belteshazzar must be carefully distinguished from Belshazzar. It is said to mean, <span class= "ital">protect his life</span> (<span class= "ital">balatsu-usur</span>). Daniel appears, if this be the true meaning of the name, to have endeared himself at a very early period to Ashpenaz. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-18.htm" title="This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now you, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, for as much as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation: but you are able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.">Daniel 4:18</a>.) Abed-nego is apparently <span class= "ital">Servant of Nebo,</span> the <span class= "ital">b</span> and <span class= "ital">g</span> having been designedly interchanged, on account of Azariah's unwillingness to bear a heathen name. Shadrach and Meshach have not as yet been explained, but probably the clue to their interpretation is to be found in the last syllable, <span class= "ital">ach,</span> which occurs also in Merodach and Arioch.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah</span>. The versions present no difficulty here, only the Septuagint adds a clause to bring this verse into harm(my with ver. 3: the Septuagint rendering is, "And there were of the race of the sons of Israel that came from Judaea, Daniel, Ananias, Mishael, and Azarias." That they were of "the children of Judah" seems to exclude the possibility of these four belonging to any other tribe, all the more that the whole children of Israel are spoken of in the third verse. The version which we find in the Septuagint leaves the matter tree. At the same time, the addition is one that is so naturally suggested by the third verse, that we cannot claim that the reading of the Septuagint is the more probable. The names of the four companions all occur elsewhere, and, as is usual with Hebrew names, all are significant. Daniel means either "Judge of God" or "God my Judge." As Hebrew grammar is now, the latter is the meaning; but there was an older form of the construct state, which appears in proper names like "Gabriel," which makes it probable that "Judge of God" or "Divine Judge" is the meaning intended to be conveyed. This meaning is in,plied in the story of Susanna and the eiders. David's son by Abigail the Carmelitess is called Daniel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-1.htm">1 Chronicles 3:1</a>. In the case of the son of David, the name would probably indicate the confidence in God which his father felt, rather than any description of the son. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-2.htm">Ezra 8:2</a> a Daniel is mentioned who seems to be a son of Ithamar. We say "<span class="accented">seems</span> to <span class="accented">be</span>," because it is evident that there is an omission somewhere of a name; if the omission has taken place before <span class="accented">m'bne Phinhas</span>, then Daniel becomes the representative of the sons of David, and Hattush the representative of the <span class="accented">sons</span> of Pabath. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-6.htm">Nehemiah 10:6</a> in the number of the priests who sealed the covenant, is a "Daniel" named, who may be the same as the preceding. In the LXX. version of the apocryphal additions to Daniel, the prophet is identified with the priest. The first verse in the story of Bel and the Dragon is, "There was a certain man, a priest, whose name was Daniel, the son of Abal, the familiar friend of the King of Babylon." There is nothing to make it certain, it we do not take the phrase here in its absolute sense, that Daniel did not belong to the family of Aaron; if we take the phrase in its restricted sense, then the balance of probability is that he was a member of the Davidic family. Hananiah (<span class="accented">Hananyah</span>; Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>: the Hebrew form, as in the case of other names with the same termination, is sometimes lengthened to <span class="accented">Hananyahu</span>). The name means "The Lord Jehovah is gracious." This name is one of the most common in the Bible. Sometimes it is reversed, and becomes <span class="accented">Jehohanan</span> or <span class="accented">Johanan</span>, and hence "John." The earliest is the head of the sixteenth of the twenty-four courses into which David divided the Hemanites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-4.htm">2 Chronicles 25:4</a>). In the reign of Uzziah there appears one as a chief captain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-11.htm">2 Chronicles 26:11</a>). In Jeremiah there are three; most prominent, however, is the false prophet who declared that Jeconiah and all his fellow-captives would be brought back in the space of two years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-15.htm">Jeremiah 28:15</a>). One of the ancestors of our Lord, called in Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-27.htm">Luke 3:27</a>) Joanna, the son of Rhess, grandson of Zerubbabel, is called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-19.htm">1 Chronicles 3:19</a> Hananiah, and reckoned a son of Zerubbabel. In the Book of Nehemiah there are several persons spoken of as bearing this name, not impossibly as many as six. In New Testament times it was still common: Ananias the husband of Sapphira (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1</a>); the devout Jew of Damascus, sent to Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-10.htm">Acts 9:10</a>); the high priest in the time of Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-2.htm">Acts 23:2</a>). Unlike Hananiah, Mishael is one of the rarer names It occurs as the name of one of the sons of Uzziel, the uncle of Moses and Aaron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-22.htm">Exodus 6:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-4.htm">Leviticus 10:4</a>), and again as one who stood at Ezra's left hand when he read the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-4.htm">Nehemiah 8:4</a>). There is some question as to the meaning of the name. Two interpretations have been suggested; the simplest and most direct is, "Who is what God is;" the other is, "Who is like God." The objection to the first is that the contracted relative is employed, which does not elsewhere appear in this book. This, however, is not insuperable, as the contracted form of the relative was in common use in the northern kingdom, and might, therefore, appear in a name; the objection to the second is that a letter is omitted, but such omissions continually occur. Hitzig refers to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, as a case in point. Azariah, "Jehovah is Helper," is, like Hananiah, a very common name throughout Jewish history It is the name by which Uzziah is called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-21.htm">2 Kings 14:21</a>: 15:1, 7, 8, 17 (called Uzziah in vers. 13, 30, as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27.htm">2 Chronicles 27</a>.) It is the name of four high priests: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-10.htm">1 Chronicles 6:10</a>)during the reign of Solomon, the grandson of Zadok; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the high priest during the reign of Jehoshaphat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-11.htm">1 Chronicles 6:11</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> high priest during the reign of his namesake Azariah or Uzziah King of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-17.htm">2 Chronicles 26:17-20</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> high priest in the reign of Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-10.htm">2 Chronicles 31:10-14</a>). There is also a prophet of this name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-1.htm">2 Chronicles 15:1</a>) in the days of Asa King of Judah. While this name is so common before the Captivity, it is not so common after it, though there is a captain of the army of Judas Maccabteus called "Azarias." While all the names contain the name of God, either in the covenant form "Jehovah" or the common form "el," yet there is nothing in the names to suggest the history before us. Jewish tradition made them out to be of the royal family; of this there is no certainty. In the time of Jerome it was held they were eunuchs, and thus the prophecy in Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-7.htm">Isaiah 39:7</a>) was fulfilled. Others have held that <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-3.htm">Isaiah 56:3</a>, "Let not the eunuch say, I am a dry tree," had a reference to those captives. So far, however, as we know, eunuchs might be attendants of Assyrian and Babylonian monarchs might bear the state umbrella over their heads, might give the cup to them, might arrange their couch for them, or announce their approach to the harem, but were not their councillors or warriors. That was left for the days of the Byzantine Empire, when the eunuch Narses retained Italy for the empire. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, took Jerusalem, and carried whom and what he pleased away. From this first captivity, most think the seventy years are to be dated. It is the interest of princes to employ wise men; and it is their wisdom to find out and train up such. Nebuchadnezzar ordered that these chosen youths should be taught. All their Hebrew names had something of God in them; but to make them forget the God of their fathers, the Guide of their youth, the heathen gave them names that savoured of idolatry. It is painful to reflect how often public education tends to corrupt the principles and morals.</body></html>
