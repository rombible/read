Each finds favour with his master, and afterwards with a foreign monarch. The grace of God enables each to overcome the temptations into which his circumstances lead him. The acute natural faculties of each are miraculously increased by God; and, lastly, each is sent into a foreign land to comfort exiled Israel. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/39-21.htm" title="But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.">Genesis 39:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-50.htm" title="And forgive your people that have sinned against you, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against you, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:">1Kings 8:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-11.htm" title="O LORD, I beseech you, let now your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants, who desire to fear your name: and prosper, I pray you, your servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.">Nehemiah 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-46.htm" title="He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.">Psalm 106:46</a>.) No less striking is the resemblance of Nebuchadnezzar to Pharaoh.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.</span> The word here translated "tender love" really means "bowels," and then "mercy" or "compassion." Hence the Apostle Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-1.htm">Philippians 2:1</a>) combines the two meanings, "If there be any bowels and mercies." The Revised Version is here to be preferred, "favour and compassion,' as the Authorized exaggerates the affection the prince of the eunuchs had for Daniel. The versions in this verse do not afford any marked variations. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "Lord," usually employed to translate <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>, Jehovah, instead of <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). It is not impossible that the original reading may have been <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>, though it is to be admitted not likely. <span class="accented">Rahameem</span> is translated <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>," favour," in the Septuagint, which is a weak rendering; Theodotion renders <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, which may be regarded as practically equivalent to our Revised Version. While the third verse speaks of the "chief" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>) of the eunuchs, a Babylonian and Assyrian title, the more usual Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> replaces it in this verse and in that which precedes it. From this root the Assyrian and Babylonian word for "king," <span class="accented">sat</span> or <span class="accented">sarru</span>, was derived, while <span class="accented">tab</span> fell on evil days. Among the later Jews it became equivalent to mr doctors of divinity. Before the word for "God" (<span class="accented">Elohim</span>) there is the article. So far as the form stands, it might be plural, and therefore be capable of being translated "the gods," but the verb being singular renders that translation impossible. The affection with which the chief of the eunuchs regarded Daniel is notified to us as the result of God's goodness, who had thus given him favour in the eyes of him set over him. The Hebrew never failed to recognize, in his devouter moments, that the hearts of all men are in the hands of God; that by him kings reign and princes decree wisdom. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:8-16 The interest we think we make for ourselves, we must acknowledge to be God's gift. Daniel was still firm to his religion. Whatever they called him, he still held fast the spirit of an Israelite. These youths scrupled concerning the meat, lest it should be sinful. When God's people are in Babylon they need take special care that they partake not of her sins. It is much to the praise of young people, not to covet or seek the delights of sense. Those who would excel in wisdom and piety, must learn betimes to keep the body under. Daniel avoided defiling himself with sin; and we should more fear that than any outward trouble. It is easier to keep temptation at a distance, than to resist it when near. And we cannot better improve our interest in any with whom we have found favour, than to use it to keep us from sin. People will not believe the benefit of avoiding excess, and of a spare diet, nor how much they contribute to the health of the body, unless they try. Conscientious temperance will always do more, even for the comfort of this life, than sinful indulgence.</body></html>
