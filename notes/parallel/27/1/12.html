(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-41.htm" title="Thus have I been twenty years in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your cattle: and you have changed my wages ten times.">Genesis 31:41</a>.) By adopting this mode of life, Daniel resumes the simple diet commonly used by his ancestors previously to their entering Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/12-15.htm" title="Notwithstanding you may kill and eat flesh in all your gates, whatever your soul lusts after, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which he has given you: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.">Deuteronomy 12:15-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-5.htm" title="And you shall speak and say before the LORD your God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous:">Deuteronomy 26:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-9.htm" title="And he has brought us into this place, and has given us this land, even a land that flows with milk and honey.">Deuteronomy 26:9</a>). This simplicity of life prevailed till the early times of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/17-17.htm" title="And Jesse said to David his son, Take now for your brothers an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp of your brothers;">1Samuel 17:17-18</a>). At the Persian court, in later times, Daniel changed his rule of life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-3.htm" title="I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.">Daniel 10:3</a>), the infirmities of age beginning to tell upon his constitution.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</span> The Septuagint seems to have read <span class="accented">yutan</span>, "let there be given," instead of <span class="accented">yitnu</span>, "let them give." <span class="accented">Zero'im</span>, "seeds" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, Theodotion), "pulse" (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, Septuagint and Authorized and Revised Versions). This word occurs only here; it differs, however, only by the second vowel from <span class="accented">zeruim</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-11.htm">Isaiah 61:11</a>, and there it is rendered as by Theodotion here, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>. As the vowels were not written for centuries after the latest critical date of Daniel, it is in the highest degree absurd to ground any argument on the pronunciation affixed to the word by these late scribes, probably with as great caprice as made them maintain to all time "suspended letters" here and there in the text, or sometimes begin a word with a final <span class="accented">mere.</span> Professor Bevan regards this word a s possibly a scribe's mistake for <span class="accented">zeronim</span>, a word with the same meaning, which occurs in ver. 16, and is found in the Talmud. He might more naturally regard <span class="accented">zero'him as a</span> scribe's mistake for <span class="accented">zero'im.</span> As, however, the word is Aramaic, occurring both in the Eastern and Western dialects, it may be a case where the original word shines through. <span class="accented">Prove thy servants ten days.</span> The word used for "prove' is that frequently used of God in relation to men, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-1.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>," God did prove Abraham." Calvin thinks that Daniel made this request because he had been directed by the Divine Spirit. We would not for one moment deny that all wisdom comes down from above, and that it is the Spirit of the Almighty that giveth understanding, yet the suggestion was a reasonable one, the period was long enough to have given signs that it affected them injuriously, and yet not so long but the evil effects might easily be removed. <span class="accented">Ten days.</span> It may be that this is merely a round number - an easily marked period - but an experiment would have a definite period. It is approximately the third of a revolution of the moon, and as the Babylonians were attentive observers of the movements of the heavenly bodies, especially of the moon, "ten days" is likely enough to be a period with them, as certainly a week was. Moreover, among all the nations of antiquity numbers were credited with special powers, as all who have studied Greek philosophy know. Pythagoras rested the whole universe on number. This theory, in which to some extent he was followed by Plato, seems to have been derived from Assyrian, if not Babylonian sources. Thus Lenormant, in 'La Magic,' gives a dialogue between <span class="accented">Hea</span> and his son <span class="accented">Hilgq-mulu-qi.</span> Everything depends on knowing "the number." It may be noted, as bearing on this, that in the bas-reliefs portraying a feast from the palace of Asshurbanipal, the guests are seated in messes of four round small tables. If, then, as is probable, all these young cadets at the Babylonian court sat in the royal presence, they would have a table to themselves, and thus the peculiarity of their meal would not be patent to the whole company. Had the number of friends been more, they would have been conspicuous: had they been fewer, they would have been observed by those added to make up the number. Their request to be allotted to eat only pulse and to drink only water, had not, as we have already said, anything necessarily of the asceticism of the Essenes. They, the Essenes, rather started <span class="accented">from</span> Daniel and his friends. Maimonides tells us that there were three kinds of <span class="accented">zeronim - tbu'ah</span>, "crops," wheat, barley, millet, etc.; <span class="accented">gatonith</span>, "small crops," peas, beans, lentils; <span class="accented">geenah</span>, "garden seeds," such as mint, anise, and cummin. The English versions and the Septuagint agree in regarding the second of these classes as here intended. There is this to be said, that seeds are the most nourishing form of vegetable diet. Aben Ezra suggests "rice" as the seeds used for this purpose; but as, just as in all hot climates, vegetables and fruits of all sorts were largely consumed in Babylon, definition is unnecessary. To the present day among the inhabitants of the district around ancient Babylon, indeed, over the Levant generally, dates and raisins, with grain, and in the season fresh fruit, form the staple food. Daniel really prayed to live as the common people. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:8-16 The interest we think we make for ourselves, we must acknowledge to be God's gift. Daniel was still firm to his religion. Whatever they called him, he still held fast the spirit of an Israelite. These youths scrupled concerning the meat, lest it should be sinful. When God's people are in Babylon they need take special care that they partake not of her sins. It is much to the praise of young people, not to covet or seek the delights of sense. Those who would excel in wisdom and piety, must learn betimes to keep the body under. Daniel avoided defiling himself with sin; and we should more fear that than any outward trouble. It is easier to keep temptation at a distance, than to resist it when near. And we cannot better improve our interest in any with whom we have found favour, than to use it to keep us from sin. People will not believe the benefit of avoiding excess, and of a spare diet, nor how much they contribute to the health of the body, unless they try. Conscientious temperance will always do more, even for the comfort of this life, than sinful indulgence.</body></html>
