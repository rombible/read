It reads thus: "And in all learning (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span>, a literal rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">dabhar</span>, 'a word' or 'thing'), and knowledge and education (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>) whatsoever the king asked of them, he found them ten times wiser than all the wise and learned men in all his kingdom." Thus far the verse is a rendering, almost slavishly close, of the Massoretic text; while the translator has recognized that the sentence is incomplete as it stands, and has inserted <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, and translated <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">al</span>) by <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span>. But the translation proceeds, "And the king honoured them, and appointed them rulers." This seems to have been due to a various reading. The sentence here translated was probably, in an old recension of the text, all that stood here, and some scribe, finding it, inserted it here to complete the sentence. The translation, however, proceeds yet further, "And constituted (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) them wiser than all those of his in affairs in all his land and in his kingdom." This sentence has all the appearance of an attempt to render into Greek a piece of Hebrew that the translator imperfectly understood. <span class="accented">As</span> we find that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>, represents occasionally <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;</span>, and as the Syriac <span class="accented">vav</span> and the old Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;</span> were almost identical in shape, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">yod'a</span>,) might be read as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span> evidently the translator has read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5db;&#x5de;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">hacmeem</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5bb;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">hartummeem</span>), and has transferred the '<span class="accented">al col</span> from before <span class="accented">hartummeem</span> to before the next word, which seems to have read, not '<span class="accented">ashshapheem</span>, but <span class="accented">hartzo</span>, the relative seems to have been omitted, and the second <span class="accented">col</span>, "all." This great variety of reading suggests suspicions of the verse altogether, which the content of the verse rather strengthens. Theodotion is in strict agreement with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta also is at one with it in this, but these are late compared with the Septuagint. It has been tea,sued that the Book of Daniel is a story modelled on the history of Joseph, and the presence of <span class="accented">harlummeem</span> here is regarded as a proof of this <span class="accented">quasi</span> Egyptian origin (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11</a>, etc.). One thing is clear, that the word - whatever it was - was unknown in Alexandria, where this translation was made; <span class="accented">hartummeern</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> occurring in the Pentateuch, the earliest part of the Old Testament translated, was certain to be known: how did the word here happen not to be known? We can understand the phenomenon if some word, probably of Babylonian origin, and unknown in Egypt and Palestine, occupied the place and was modified into a more intelligible shape by being turned into <span class="accented">hartummeem.</span> As the verse stands, <span class="accented">hartummeem is</span> grammatically placed in apposition to the following word, '<span class="accented">ashshapheem</span>, as there is no conjunction to unite the two words. It is acknowledged by Professor Bevan that the latter word has an Assyrian origin; it is not inconceivable that <span class="accented">hartummeem</span> is really the explanatory word, though the arrangement of the words is decidedly against this view. It is to be observed here that '<span class="accented">ashshapheem</span> has been naturalized in Eastern Aramaic, but has not found a lodgment in Western, save in Daniel. We cannot help feeling a little suspicion of the authenticity of this verse. This phrase, "ten times better," has all the look of that exaggeration which became the prevailing vice of later Judaism. As we have indicated, the variations in regard to the precise reading deepen this suspicion. If, however, the reference here is really to Daniel's revelation to the king of his dream, then the statement in the text is less objectionable. This was such a marvellous feat, and one that so put Daniel boys all the wise men of Babylon, that the language of the verse before us is rather rhetorical than exaggerated. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:17-21 Daniel and his fellows kept to their religion; and God rewarded them with eminence in learning. Pious young persons should endeavour to do better than their fellows in useful things; not for the praise of man, but for the honour of the gospel, and that they may be qualified for usefulness. And it is well for a country, and for the honour of a prince, when he is able to judge who are best fitted to serve him, and prefers them on that account. Let young men steadily attend to this chapter; and let all remember that God will honour those who honour him, but those who despise him shall be lightly esteemed.</body></html>
