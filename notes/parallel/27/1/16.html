The Massoretic has the article here before "Melzar" - a fact that the Authorized does not indicate; the Revised renders more correctly, "the steward." The version of the Septuagint does not differ much from the Massoretic, only the word translated "that they should drink" is omitted; on the other hand, we have the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) put in composition with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), "gave them instead," as if, in the text before the translator, the <span class="accented">mem</span>, which begins <span class="accented">mishtayhem</span>, had been put to the end of <span class="accented">yayin</span>, "wine," making it "their wine" - a construction which would be more symmetrical than the present. Only it is difficult to see how either <span class="accented">tahath asher</span> could be changed into <span class="accented">shtayhem</span>, or vice <span class="accented">versa.</span> The Septuagint translation suggests a simpler and more natural text - not a simplified one - therefore it is, on the whole, to be preferred. The careful word-for-word translation of the beginning of the verse renders it little likely that the translator would paraphrase at the end; c g. the word translated in our version "thus" is really <span class="accented">veeay'he</span>, "it was," and in the LXX. this is rendered <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>, "it was." Theodotion is in absolute agreement with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta calls the steward <span class="accented">ma</span>-<span class="accented">nitzor</span>, and renders the last clause, "<span class="accented">and</span> he gave to them seeds to eat, and water to drink," evidently borrowed from the twelfth verse. The result of the success of the experiment is that the youths are no more importuned to partake of the king's dainties. The steward, or the attendant who looked after their <span class="accented">mess</span>, supplied them with pulse. It has occurred to two commentators, widely separated from each other in point of time, that the consent of the "Melzar ' was all the more easily gained, that he could utilize the abstemiousness of these Hebrew youths to his own private advantage. Both Jephet-ibn-Ali in the beginning of the eleventh century, and Ewald in the middle of the nineteenth, maintain that the "Melzar' used to his own purposes, possibly sold, the portion of food and wine that the Hebrew youths abjured. Certainly the verb <span class="accented">nasa</span> means the lifting and carrying away, and suggests that every day the portions of food and wine were first carried to the table of these Hebrews, and then, after having been placed before them, were removed and pulse brought instead. When we think of it, some such process would have to take place. If it had been observed that one table was never supplied with a portion from the king's table, there might have been remarks made, and the "<span class="accented">Melzar"</span> would have fallen into disgrace with his sovereign, and the Hebrew youths would possibly have shared his disgrace. As to how the portions thus retained were disposed of, we need not be curious; there would, no doubt, be plenty of claimants for the broken victuals from the King of Babylon's table, without accusing the "Melzar" of dishonest motives. The fact that the verbs are in participle implies that henceforth it was the regular habit of the "<span class="accented">Melzar"</span> to remove from before the tour friends the royal dainties, and supply them instead with pulse. We have already referred to the word used for "<span class="accented">pulse</span>; ' it is here <span class="accented">zayroneem</span>, whereas in the twelfth verse it is <span class="accented">zayroeem.</span> Not impossibly in the verse before us we have another case of the original Aramaic shining through the translation; in the Peshitta the word is <span class="accented">zer'oona</span>, Whatever the word was, it seems certain that originally it was the same in both places, as in none of the versions is there any variation. It is not so impossible that originally the vocalization was different, and that the word was the ordinary word <span class="accented">zer'aim</span>, "seeds." This certainly is the translation of Theodotion. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:8-16 The interest we think we make for ourselves, we must acknowledge to be God's gift. Daniel was still firm to his religion. Whatever they called him, he still held fast the spirit of an Israelite. These youths scrupled concerning the meat, lest it should be sinful. When God's people are in Babylon they need take special care that they partake not of her sins. It is much to the praise of young people, not to covet or seek the delights of sense. Those who would excel in wisdom and piety, must learn betimes to keep the body under. Daniel avoided defiling himself with sin; and we should more fear that than any outward trouble. It is easier to keep temptation at a distance, than to resist it when near. And we cannot better improve our interest in any with whom we have found favour, than to use it to keep us from sin. People will not believe the benefit of avoiding excess, and of a spare diet, nor how much they contribute to the health of the body, unless they try. Conscientious temperance will always do more, even for the comfort of this life, than sinful indulgence.</body></html>
