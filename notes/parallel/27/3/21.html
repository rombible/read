As far as can be determined from the etymology of the words, the "coat" was an under-clothing, which covered the whole body; the "hose" was some species of tunic--something "spread out" over the under-clothing; the "hat" (the only one of the three words of which no Hebrew root exists (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-27.htm" title="And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had on him an ephod of linen.">1Chronicles 15:27</a>), was a sort of cloak, used probably for State occasions only.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace</span>. The LXX. omits the complexity of garments, and translates, "Thus these men were bound, having their sandals, and their hats upon their heads, with their other garments, and were cast into the burning fiery furnace." It would seem that <span class="accented">karbelatheon</span> was either not in the text before the translator or was omitted by him. The latter hypothesis seems a hazardous one to adopt without good ground. We have no reason to accuse the Septuagint translator of this practice. Theodotion also presents signs of omission. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5da;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5e1;&#x5e0;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">but simply</span> transliterated, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. Under this word Schleusner <span class="accented">says</span>, "Vestis Medica sou Babylonica ad genus pertingens." Aquila, it may be not,d, also transliterates, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>. Theodotion's rendering is, "Then those men were bound in their coats (?), and hats, and hosen, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace." The Peshitta does as Theodotion, and transliterates with the change of a <span class="accented">shin fur a samech</span>, in regard to the first word, and instead of <span class="accented">leboosheen</span>, "garments," has <span class="accented">qoobe'een</span>, which is rendered by Castelli <span class="accented">pileus</span>, or <span class="accented">g</span>,<span class="accented">lea</span>, a "military cap," or a "helmet." He wrongly says that <span class="accented">qoob'o is</span> used to translate <span class="accented">karbelathElon</span>; the word used for that is <span class="accented">nihtho.</span> We need not go into a discussion of the various garments named here. It is to be observed that, by the time of the Septuagint and the original of the version edited and revised by Theodotion, the moaning of the terms was lost - a thing hardly possible on the critical supposition that the date of Daniel is <span class="date">B.C. 168</span>, if, as seems necessary to suppose from the Greek prologue to Ecclesiasticus, it was already translated into Greek by, at latest, <span class="date">B.C. 130</span>. The point brought out by these garments being mentioned is in order to show the power of God manifested on them. They were all of an inflammable material, therefore emphasis was given to the miracle by this. But, further, it shows they were taken as they were, without opportunity of putting on any specially medicated robes, if such could be imagined (but see <span class="accented">Longman's</span>, August, 1894, reference to Basil Thomson's' South Sea Yarns'). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:19-27 Let Nebuchadnezzar heat his furnace as hot as he can, a few minutes will finish the torment of those cast into it; but hell-fire tortures, and yet does not kill. Those who worshipped the beast and his image, have no rest, no pause, no moment free from pain, Re 14:10,11. Now was fulfilled in the letter that great promise, Isa 43:2, When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned. Leaving it to that God who preserved them in the fire, to bring them out, they walked up and down in the midst, supported and encouraged by the presence of the Son of God. Those who suffer for Christ, have his presence in their sufferings, even in the fiery furnace, and in the valley of the shadow of death. Nebuchadnezzar owns them for servants of the most high God; a God able to deliver them out of his hand. It is our God only is the consuming fire, Heb 12:29. Could we but see into the eternal world, we should behold the persecuted believer safe from the malice of his foes, while they are exposed to the wrath of God, and tormented in unquenchable fires.</body></html>
