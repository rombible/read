The last words, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> evidently belong to the beginning of the next verse. It is possible <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> is due to another reading, but may also have been the result of a desire for variation. Theodotion does not differ from the Massoretic text The two Greek versions agree with the Massoretic in omitting <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. The rendering of the Peshitta is, "In the hour when the nations heard the voice of the horn, and flute, and lyre, (<span class="accented">qithra</span>), and harp (<span class="accented">kinnor</span>), and pipe (<span class="accented">tziphonia</span>), and all kinds of music, all these peoples, nations, and tongues, fell down and worshipped the golden image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up" It is to be noted that <span class="accented">kinnor</span>, its Shemitic equivalent, here again follows <span class="accented">qithra</span>, and that <span class="accented">pesanterin is</span> again omitted. Jerome, in opposition to the Massoretic and the Greek versions, inserts <span class="accented">symphonia.</span> In regard to the Massoretic text here, as in the fifth verse, we have <span class="accented">qathros</span> instead of the <span class="accented">qithros</span> of the K'thib; in this, the K'thib agrees, as generally, with the Eastern instead of the Western form the word assumes. Professor Bevan compares the use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> here with that in the Palmyrene inscriptions (Vogue 15). <span class="accented">Zemara is</span> said by Keil to refer only to song; but Furst, Gesenius, and Wirier apply the word to instrumental music. It may, as a matter of fact, be either; if it be a chorus of voices, it is then equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. This verse simply chronicles the obedience that was at once and unquestioningly rendered to the command of Nebuchadnezzar. The obedience of these Gentiles served to bring out into clearer relief the steadfastness of these Jews, or, what appears to the king and his courtiers, their obstinacy. Not impossibly, their resistance to the king was emphasized by their remaining standing amid the crowd of those prostrate officials. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 In the height of the image, about thirty yards, probably is included a pedestal, and most likely it was only covered with plates of gold, not a solid mass of that precious metal. Pride and bigotry cause men to require their subjects to follow their religion, whether right or wrong, and when worldly interest allures, and punishment overawes, few refuse. This is easy to the careless, the sensual, and the infidel, who are the greatest number; and most will go their ways. There is nothing so bad which the careless world will not be drawn to by a concert of music, or driven to by a fiery furnace. By such methods, false worship has been set up and maintained.</body></html>
