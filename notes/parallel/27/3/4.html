The former is applied to Israel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-6.htm" title="He has showed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.">Psalm 111:6</a>, where occurs the phrase, "people of Jehovah." The word "languages" is applied (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-5.htm" title="By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.">Genesis 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-20.htm" title="These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.">Genesis 10:20</a>, &c.) to tribes as represented by their languages. Hence these three expressions denote all nations subject to the empire, of whatever description of language, government, or federation. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-29.htm" title="Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.">Daniel 3:29</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-1.htm" title="Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied to you.">Daniel 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-14.htm" title="And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.">Daniel 7:14</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages, that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up.</span> The Septuagint rendering is, "And the herald proclaimed to the multitudes, To you it is announced, peoples and countries, nations and tongues, when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, the pipe, the harp, the sackbut, and psaltery, of chorus, and of all kinds of music, that ye fall down and worship the golden image which King Nebuchadnezzar set up." It is clear that the Septuagint translator rendered <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span> as "host," and translated <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;</span> as if it were <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span>. The balanced cadence of the next clause seems more natural, if due to the Aramaic source than to the Greek translator. The musical instruments are also arranged in the same cadenced fashion, broken to some extent by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. Theodotion is, as usual, in closer agreement with the Massoretic text, but omits <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. The Peshitta in the fourth verse agrees not only word for word, but we might almost say syllable for syllable, with the Massoretic text. In the fifth verse it omits <span class="accented">pesanterin</span>; instead of <span class="accented">sabka</span>, it has <span class="accented">kinora</span>, which is usually regarded as the Hebrew equivalent of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>; instead of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, it has <span class="accented">tziphonia</span>, which suggests a different etymology. It is true Strack ('Neu Hebraische Sprache') points out that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;</span> has a tendency to become <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;</span> before syllables with the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;</span> sound or at the end of words, but this is neither of these; the syllable with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;</span> is the first, not the last, and there is no <span class="accented">d</span> or <span class="accented">t</span> sound in the word. Jerome is in strict verbal agreement with the Massoretic text. We shall have to devote a short excursus to the names of the musical instruments which occur here. In eagerness to find proofs of the late origin of the Book of Daniel - of its origin in the times of the Hellenic domination, <span class="accented">karoza</span> was derived from .<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;</span>, that etymology is universally abandoned now. <span class="accented">O</span> <span class="accented">people</span>, <span class="accented">nations</span>, <span class="accented">and languages.</span> It ought rather to be <span class="accented">peoples.</span> Bishop Wordsworth remarks on the resemblance which this phrase bears to tsar used of the mystical Babylon in Revelation (Revelation 13:7; 17:15), and adds that she also "commands them to fall down and worship the image which she has set up." In regard to the following verse, the sculptures of Nineveh prove the prominence given to music in all important occasions, as the celebration of a triumph or the dedication of a temple. The names of the musical instruments are not so generally preserved. It was most likely when the rays of the morning sun smote the golden tip of the obelisk, that there came the burst of music which was to serve as a signal for all the multitudes to fall down and worship. The image was looked upon as the sign of the god it represented; it received the worship meant for him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 In the height of the image, about thirty yards, probably is included a pedestal, and most likely it was only covered with plates of gold, not a solid mass of that precious metal. Pride and bigotry cause men to require their subjects to follow their religion, whether right or wrong, and when worldly interest allures, and punishment overawes, few refuse. This is easy to the careless, the sensual, and the infidel, who are the greatest number; and most will go their ways. There is nothing so bad which the careless world will not be drawn to by a concert of music, or driven to by a fiery furnace. By such methods, false worship has been set up and maintained.</body></html>
