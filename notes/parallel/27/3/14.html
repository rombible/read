There seems to have been a difference of reading here. The first words must have been read as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">behon</span> '<span class="accented">aleehon</span>), and the mysterious word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">hatzeda</span>) <span class="accented">had</span> occupied a position before, not after <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5e8;</span>. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> in the aphel in Syriac means "to look steadily." This interpretation of the word shows that the translator had before him a document in which Syriac meanings might be expected. Theodotion renders the last clause, "If truly (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>) Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, my gods ye do not worship, and before the golden image which I have set up ye do not prostrate yourselves?" - a construction that shows a slavish following of the Aramaic. The sense here is really the same as that of the Authorized Version. The Peshitta renders the opening word of this latter portion of the verse, "in truth" - a rendering with which Jerome agrees. Professor Bevan suggests another reading, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, followed by Behrmann. Unfortunately, the meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> is very doubtful. The common rendering is "of set purpose." So Furst, Gesenius, Winer, among lexicographers, and Bertholdt, Ewald, Aben Ezra, Wordsworth, among commentators; Keil, Kliefoth, Kra-nichfeld, hold it to mean "with evil intent." It is suggested also that it may mean "in mockery." The reading suggested by Professor Bevan and supported by Behrmann is not to be thought of; they appeal to Theodotion, but when this word occurs in the previous chapter (ver. 5), Theodotion translates <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>, which makes it evident that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d6;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">azda</span>) did not mean "truth" to him. More may be said for the Peshitta, only that, though <span class="accented">azda</span> does seem to mean "truth," the translation is not the same in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-5.htm">Daniel 2:5</a> and the present verse. If there is to be a change of reading, that indicated by the Septuagint translation is preferable. The Septuagint translator has had <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;</span> before him, and there is no evidence that Theodotion had not. The change in the arrangement of the words is a simpler variation than any other, and it retains the word in its Syriac meaning; otherwise we should be inclined to follow the lexicographers, and translate "of set purpose." If we take the view of this word indicated above, then we may imagine Nebuchadnezzar looking steadfastly on those youths who had dared to oppose him, hoping, it may be, to see them shrink from his gaze, as he had seen so many of the kings he had conquered do. If this is correct, it gives a point to what the youths begin their answer with in ver. 16. If we take the more common rendering, we see the generosity of the king. Full of rage and fury as he is, he will give them an opening to say that it was of inadvertence that they failed to obey his decree. This is fully borne out by the next verse. If Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury at the crime against the gods, he yet was careful that the envy of the Chaldeans should not hinder him from giving the Jews who had been accused to him a chance to defend themselves. This mental fairness it was which, despite his outbursts of capricious rage, drew the affection of those about him to Nebuchadnezzar. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:8-18 True devotion calms the spirit, quiets and softens it, but superstition and devotion to false gods inflame men's passions. The matter is put into a little compass, Turn, or burn. Proud men are still ready to say, as Nebuchadnezzar, Who is the Lord, that I should fear his power? Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego did not hesitate whether they should comply or not. Life or death were not to be considered. Those that would avoid sin, must not parley with temptation when that to which we are allured or affrighted is manifestly evil. Stand not to pause about it, but say, as Christ did, Get thee behind me, Satan. They did not contrive an evasive answer, when a direct answer was expected. Those who make their duty their main care, need not be anxious or fearful concerning the event. The faithful servants of God find him able to control and overrule all the powers armed against them. Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst. If He be for us, we need not fear what man can do unto us. God will deliver us, either from death or in death. They must obey God rather than man; they must rather suffer than sin; and must not do evil that good may come. Therefore none of these things moved them. The saving them from sinful compliance, was as great a miracle in the kingdom of grace, as the saving them out of the fiery furnace was in the kingdom of nature. Fear of man and love of the world, especially want of faith, make men yield to temptation, while a firm persuasion of the truth will deliver them from denying Christ, or being ashamed of him. We are to be meek in our replies, but we must be decided that we will obey God rather than man.</body></html>
