Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth of the midst of the</span> fire. The variations of the Septuagint Version here arc inconsiderable. Instead of "spake and said," it renders, "called them by name," and omits the second repetition of the names, and the pleonastic "come hither;" instead of "Most High God," it has"God of gods Most High." Theodotion is in closer agreement with the Massoretic text; the only differnce is that "spake" is omitted. The Peshitta and Vulgate are in exact accordance with the Massoretic. The distinction between <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> is "go out" and "come." It is well rendered in our Authorized Verb-ion. only there was no need of "hither" being put in <span class="accented">italics.</span> As above mentioned, this shows the form of the furnace to be not unlike our own - open at the top, but having a door at the side. It was to this side door that the king approached. The fact that Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges Jehovah to be "Most High God" does not imply any recognition of his supreme Divinity, any more than a king of France acknowledged the supremacy of the head of the Holy Roman Empire. when in the credentials of his ambassador the emperor was called <span class="accented">Dominus urbis et orbis.</span> It was simply a matter of what we may call religious etiquette to address gods of the higher class as "god of gods." and "god most high." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a> Nebuchadnezzar had already declared the God of Daniel to be "God of gods" It is not impossible that to the Babylonians '<span class="accented">illa'a</span> might have the appearance of a proper name. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:19-27 Let Nebuchadnezzar heat his furnace as hot as he can, a few minutes will finish the torment of those cast into it; but hell-fire tortures, and yet does not kill. Those who worshipped the beast and his image, have no rest, no pause, no moment free from pain, Re 14:10,11. Now was fulfilled in the letter that great promise, Isa 43:2, When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned. Leaving it to that God who preserved them in the fire, to bring them out, they walked up and down in the midst, supported and encouraged by the presence of the Son of God. Those who suffer for Christ, have his presence in their sufferings, even in the fiery furnace, and in the valley of the shadow of death. Nebuchadnezzar owns them for servants of the most high God; a God able to deliver them out of his hand. It is our God only is the consuming fire, Heb 12:29. Could we but see into the eternal world, we should behold the persecuted believer safe from the malice of his foes, while they are exposed to the wrath of God, and tormented in unquenchable fires.</body></html>
