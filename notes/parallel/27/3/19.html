According to the Babylonian mythology, there were seven demons, named "Maskim," who were the most formidable of the infernal powers. Perhaps the number "seven" has a reference to them, for the religious nature of the punishment favours the view that the overheating of the furnace was regarded as a religious act.<p><span class= "bld">Than it was wont.</span>--More correctly, <span class= "ital">than it was fitting.</span> The improper heating of the furnace led to the death of the mighty men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-22.htm" title="Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flames of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.">Daniel 3:22</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</span> The text of the LXX. is practically the same as the Massoretic, with only this exception, that "one" is omitted as unsuited to the Greek idiom. Theodotion differs more from the Massoretic - "the furnace" was to be heated "sevenfold, till it was perfectly heated (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1fc6;</span>)." The Peshitta, retaining the "one," translates, "one in seven times" - a rendering which seems to have little sense, as the Syriac idiom is the same as that before us. The change of countenance, from that of gratification at seeing a favourite, to that of rage, is a perfectly natural phenomenon, but one possibly even more marked among these races then dominant over the East than among ourselves. It was certainly not unnatural that, heathen as he was, filled with the belief in the mysterious power for good or ill that might be exercised over the empire were any of the gods offended, Nebuchadnezzar should be enraged. The result is that the calmness with which he had previously spoken with the three deserts him, and the form of his face changes, his visage becomes distorted with rage. It may be noted, in passing, that the word here used, <span class="accented">ish'tanni</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>), is the only case where the ethpael occurs in Daniel; in all other cases the form is hithpael, with the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> instead of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>. Since this is so, one is inclined to credit the peculiarity to scribal change. There is a difference here between the Q'ri and K'thib, the latter reading <span class="accented">ishlannu</span>, which agrees by attraction with <span class="accented">anapolu</span>, "face," which, as in Hebrew, is plural. In order to express his wrath, he orders that the furnace be heated sevenfold hotter than ever before. The word here translated "wont to be" is really part of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">hezuh</span>), "to see." Behrmann renders it, "Siebenmal so stark zu heizen als man ihn heizen gesehen hatte" - "commanded it to be heated seven times as hot as ever one had seen it heated." We cannot suppose the Babylonians halt any means of measuring heat of that amount; it is simply a round number, Hitzig remarks on the recurrence of "seven," as if it helped to raise a presumption against the authenticity of the book. The fact that the Babylonians recognized seven planets, and seven gods of the planets, one for each, might as readily be taken as a proof of its authenticity. The probability is that vaguely many times more fuel was placed in the furnace than had ever been done before. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:19-27 Let Nebuchadnezzar heat his furnace as hot as he can, a few minutes will finish the torment of those cast into it; but hell-fire tortures, and yet does not kill. Those who worshipped the beast and his image, have no rest, no pause, no moment free from pain, Re 14:10,11. Now was fulfilled in the letter that great promise, Isa 43:2, When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned. Leaving it to that God who preserved them in the fire, to bring them out, they walked up and down in the midst, supported and encouraged by the presence of the Son of God. Those who suffer for Christ, have his presence in their sufferings, even in the fiery furnace, and in the valley of the shadow of death. Nebuchadnezzar owns them for servants of the most high God; a God able to deliver them out of his hand. It is our God only is the consuming fire, Heb 12:29. Could we but see into the eternal world, we should behold the persecuted believer safe from the malice of his foes, while they are exposed to the wrath of God, and tormented in unquenchable fires.</body></html>
