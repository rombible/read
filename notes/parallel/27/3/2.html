The phrase, "nations. peoples, and tongues," is one that occurs with great frequency in Revelation, and also the above phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. This is an indication of the use made by the Apostle John of this version of Daniel as distinct from the Massoretic text It may also be observed that the phrase, "all in the whole inhabited earth," is placed as equal to "all the rulers of the provinces," which makes it at least possible that a misreading of the original text has occasioned the exaggeration in this particular clause. In the third verse the order is different, and to some extent the names of the officials are different also; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is left out, and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> appears in its stead, though not in the same place. Further, there are persons mentioned "great in authority." This variation may be due to an uncertainty in the mind of the translator as to the exact equivalent in Greek for the Aramaic terms. It is to be noted that "the inhabitants of the whole earth" disappear from this repetition. The last editor of the Greek text may have had two renderings before him, and drew from the one the second verse, and from the other the third. Theodotion's rendering, while in closer agreement with the Massoretic text, yet differs from it to some extent, appearing to make the latter half of ver. 2 explanatory of the former, which contains the more technical designations. In ver. 3 there is a change in the order of the terms, as to some extent a change in the terms. In the Peshitta there are evident traces that the translator had not understood the technical meaning of the terms here used. The list given is "great men of might - lords, rulers, <span class="accented">Agardaei</span>, <span class="accented">Garabdaei</span>, <span class="accented">Tarabdaei</span>, <span class="accented">Tabathaei</span>, and all the rulers of the province." These mysterious names, that seem those of tribes, have no existence elsewhere. It is singular that these words, if they are in their original shape - which they seem certainly, to be - and to appearance of Persian origin, were unintelligible to one writing on the Persian frontier at most three centuries after the critical date of Daniel. The Parthian Empire retained much of the Persian character. How was it that words of Persian meaning had disappeared there, and still remained in use, or at least still continued to be intelligible, in Palastine? The probability is that the names have undergone so great change in course of transcription that their original form can no longer be recognized. The Vulgate does not call for remark. The names of these different grades of officials are (as we now have them) some indubitably Persian, as <span class="accented">ahashdarpan</span>; others unmistakably Assyrian, <span class="accented">sagan pehah</span>; and there are some that have no recognized etymology, as <span class="accented">tiphtaye</span>: but there are none that are even plausibly derived from Greek. Yet this class of words is precisely the class where the influence of the language of the military governing nation would be manifest. The fact that while the Massoretic text has eight classes of rulers who are summoned, the Septuagint has only six, throws a suspicion on the whole list. The LXX., however, adds, "all those in the whole earth (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>)," which may be the result of misreading of <span class="accented">kol shiltoni medeen-atha</span>, or it may be a rendering of it, referring back to the classes already enumerated (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> being understood, omitting the <span class="accented">ray</span>). In Theodotion and Jerome there are seven classes. Only in the Peshitta are there the same number of classes as in the Massoretic. The Peshitta has as this first class <span class="accented">rabai heela</span>, used in the New Testament, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-4.htm">Luke 22:4</a>, of "chief captains." It is possible that <span class="accented">rabuti</span>, or some derivative from it, was in the original text here, and this was changed into the better known <span class="accented">sotrap. Sagan</span> does not call for remark; as said above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-48.htm">Daniel 2:48</a>), it is derived from <span class="accented">shakun</span> (Assyrian); the Hebrew equivalent appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-23.htm">Jeremiah 51:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-6.htm">Ezekiel 23:6</a>, and elsewhere. <span class="accented">Pebah</span> is also Assyrian in origin, also elsewhere used in Scripture. <span class="accented">Adargazrayya</span> seems a compound from <span class="accented">adar</span> and <span class="accented">gazar</span>, "to divide." Furst would make this word mean" astrologers of the god Adar." Professor Bevan would derive it from <span class="accented">endarz-gar</span>, a Persian word meaning "counsellor" - "a word which was still in use under the Sassanians." That the word had any connection with this is disproved by the fact that in the Peshitta it is rendered <span class="accented">Agardaei.</span> If the word in question had survived from the Achaemenids to the Sassanids, its meaning would necessarily be known to the Peshitta translator, whose date held between the periods of these two Persian dynasties. A Persian word of the date of the Achsemenids to have survived to the age of the Sassanids, must have been known in the intervening Parthian period. A similar difficulty occurs in regard to the next word, <span class="accented">gedabrayya - the</span> Syrian translator has simply transferred it. The simplest interpretation is that it is a variation on <span class="accented">gizbarayya</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-21.htm">Ezra 7:21</a>), and means "treasurers," which is still in use in the Syriac of the Peshitta, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-22.htm">2 Kings 10:22</a>. The question is complicated by the fact that the word which occupies the same place in the similar list in ver. 27 is <span class="accented">had-dabra</span> When we turn to the Peshitta for that verse, there is another word, <span class="accented">raur-bona.</span> <[<span class="accented">Vol13/Daniel/97]PGBR> The Septuagint, by rendering <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, shows that their reading was <span class="accented">habereen.</span> All this proves how utterly futile it is to build anything on the presence of late words in Daniel. The presence of early words from the nature of the case, is more significant. Old and unintelligible words would never be inserted in place of new and intelligible, though the reverse process might readily take place: <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">dethaberayya</span>) is rendered usually "judges," and is generally derived from the Pehlevi; but if <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">dath</span>) means a "firman," a "command," or "decree," in Aramaic, then the addition <span class="accented">bar</span> in Persian is rendered less certain. Here, again, the Peshitta translator was unaware of the meaning of the word, and renders by the mysterious word <span class="accented">tarabdaei.</span> The last class mentioned is the <span class="accented">Tiphtae.</span> This term seems to be omitted in the three Western versions at least there are only six names of ranks of rulers given in these versions, and this is a seventh. Of course, it may be that some name earlier in the list is explanatory and added later than the time when these versions were made. The Peshitta has the word <span class="accented">Tabathaei</span>, which has all the appearance of a national name. The word <span class="accented">Tiphtae</span> assumes in the K'thib a Syriac form, which, as we before remarked, is an indication of the original dialect of the book. Notwithstanding what Professor Bevan has asserted, something may be said for the conjecture that it is connected with <span class="accented">afta</span>, "to advise." But in the extreme doubt in which we are in regard to what the text precisely is, it is something like waste of time to do more than chronicle opinions. This feeling of uncertainty is increased by the fact that, as above mentioned, the two lists in the two verses before us do not agree in the three Western versions. The list in ver. 27 purports to be the same as that given here, and differs from it greatly. All that we may assume is that there were assembled different classes of the officials of the Babylonian Empire. The reading should not be <span class="accented">medeenatha</span>, "of the provinces;" but <span class="accented">medeenta</span> "of the province;" the officials that were assembled were those merely of the province of Babylon. We would maintain this, although the versions are against it, because there would be no difference in the original unpointed text. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 In the height of the image, about thirty yards, probably is included a pedestal, and most likely it was only covered with plates of gold, not a solid mass of that precious metal. Pride and bigotry cause men to require their subjects to follow their religion, whether right or wrong, and when worldly interest allures, and punishment overawes, few refuse. This is easy to the careless, the sensual, and the infidel, who are the greatest number; and most will go their ways. There is nothing so bad which the careless world will not be drawn to by a concert of music, or driven to by a fiery furnace. By such methods, false worship has been set up and maintained.</body></html>
