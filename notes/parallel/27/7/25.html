(2) persecution and affliction of the saints; (3) attempts, apparently ineffectual (he will "think to change"), against all institutions, whether of Divine or human authority: in short, a general spirit of lawlessness and unbelief. It appears that the little horn, the Antichrist of the last days, or the beast, will be successful for a time in his blasphemies and persecutions, but in the end he will be destroyed. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm" title="And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:">2Thessalonians 2:8</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Time and times and the dividing of time.--</span>This is frequently explained to mean three years and a half. Those who adopt this explanation assume that by "times" a dual is implied, which in Chaldee is represented by the plural. They next assume that by "a time" is meant one year, resting their assumption partly on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-16.htm" title="Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given to him; and let seven times pass over him.">Daniel 4:16</a>, and partly on a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-7.htm" title="And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was on the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and swore by him that lives for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.">Daniel 12:7</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-5.htm" title="And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given to him to continue forty and two months.">Revelation 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/11-2.htm" title="But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given to the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.">Revelation 11:2-3</a>. This gives a sum of three years and a half, which is interpreted either literally, or explained to mean half a sabbatical period, or half some divinely-appointed period symbolised by the number "seven." According to the second interpretation, Daniel teaches us that the days of tribulation shall be shortened (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-22.htm" title="And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.">Matthew 24:22</a>). But it may be questioned whether "years" are intended in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-16.htm" title="Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given to him; and let seven times pass over him.">Daniel 4:16</a>. Also the language in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-7.htm" title="And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was on the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and swore by him that lives for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.">Daniel 12:7</a> is very obscure. A more correct view of the prediction is that the reign of Antichrist will be divided into three periods--the first long, the second longer, the third shortest of all. It also appears that the last is to be the severest time of trial. It may be remarked that in Daniel 9 the seventy weeks are divided into three periods, forming a similar series, 7 + 62 + 1 = 70.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time. But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end. And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaved, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him</span>. The versions do not present much of note in, ver. 25, save that the Greek versions imply that dominion over all is given to the oppressors. Throughout the Septuagint has traces of explanatory expansion. <span class="accented">He shall speak words against the Most High.</span> The word "against," <span class="accented">letzad</span>, is really "to the side of." This clause may refer to blasphemy against God, but more naturally refers to self-exaltation to a place alongside of God. <span class="accented">Shall wear out the saints of the Most High.</span> Persecute them, or maintain war against them; the natural meaning of the word is "afflict." <span class="accented">And shall think to change times and laws.</span> It ought not to be "laws," in the plural, but "law." It may refer to the marked changes introduced into the calendar by Julius Caesar. Certainly the law or constitution of the Roman state was changed by him. <span class="accented">And they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.</span> Who shall be given into his hands? It is usually assumed that it is the saints; but the LXX. asserts that it is universal dominion that is given into the hands of the oppressors. We have no right to assume that '<span class="accented">iddan</span>, "a time," means "a year;" it is really any defined time. Certainly it does approximate to the time during which the temple was polluted with heathen offerings; but it also coincides with equal accuracy to the campaigns of Vespasian and Titus against the Jews. Vespasian landed in Galilee in the beginning of A.D. , and Jerusalem fell on September 5, A.D. 70. There was thus, approximately, three years and a half occupied by this war. But "centuries" might also be meant. From the birth of our Lord, on whom the oppression was first exercised, till the accession of Constantine, was three centuries and a portion of a century. <span class="accented">The judgment shall sit.</span> Not necessarily the last judgment, but the evil that is being done comes before God for judgment. The taking away of the kingdom and dominion is immediately at the end of the period indicated by "a time and times and a dividing of time." The dominion was not taken away from Epiphanes then, nor from Vespasian; it did, however, pass from the heathenish empire when Constantine ascended the throne. At the same time, any such purely limited explanation is against the whole symbolic character of this vision. It is a period of time measured by "seven" <span class="accented">halves.</span> The times may receive their definition, not from the calendar, but from their spiritual import or dynamic content. The three years of our Lord's ministry is of more moment for the history of the race than all the millennia that preceded it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:15-28 It is desirable to obtain the right and full sense of what we see and hear from God; and those that would know, must ask by faithful and fervent prayer. The angel told Daniel plainly. He especially desired to know respecting the little horn, which made war with the saints, and prevailed against them. Here is foretold the rage of papal Rome against true Christians. St. John, in his visions and prophecies, which point in the first place at Rome, has plain reference to these visions. Daniel had a joyful prospect of the prevalence of God's kingdom among men. This refers to the second coming of our blessed Lord, when the saints shall triumph in the complete fall of Satan's kingdom. The saints of the Most High shall possess the kingdom for ever. Far be it from us to infer from hence, that dominion is founded on grace. It promises that the gospel kingdom shall be set up; a kingdom of light, holiness, and love; a kingdom of grace, the privileges and comforts of which shall be the earnest and first-fruits of the kingdom of glory. But the full accomplishment will be in the everlasting happiness of the saints, the kingdom that cannot be moved. The gathering together the whole family of God will be a blessedness of Christ's coming.</body></html>
