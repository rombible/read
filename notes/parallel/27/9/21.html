The Authorised Version follows the LXX. and Theodotion. The rendering has been defended on the ground that the word translated "swiftly" comes from a root meaning "to fly." and is literally rendered by <span class= "ital">flight.</span> Thus "caused to fly in flight" means "caused to fly swiftly." The marginal version "with weariness" finds supporters, and, if adopted, must be taken to refer to the bodily condition of Daniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/8-17.htm" title="So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell on my face: but he said to me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.">Daniel 8:17-27</a>). The former translation is most in accordance with the context. The "flight" of angels is implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-2.htm" title="Above it stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he did fly.">Isaiah 6:2</a>, and should not be regarded as an idea foreign to the Old Testament.<p><span class= "bld">Touched me.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">reached me</span>. (Comp. this use of the word, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-6.htm" title="For word came to the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.">Jonah 3:6</a>.) The time of the evening sacrifice Isaiah 3 P.M., being the hour of evening prayer. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-39.htm" title="The one lamb you shall offer in the morning; and the other lamb you shall offer at even:">Exodus 29:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-4.htm" title="The one lamb shall you offer in the morning, and the other lamb shall you offer at even;">Numbers 28:4</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:20-27 An answer was immediately sent to Daniel's prayer, and it is a very memorable one. We cannot now expect that God should send answers to our prayers by angels, but if we pray with fervency for that which God has promised, we may by faith take the promise as an immediate answer to the prayer; for He is faithful that has promised. Daniel had a far greater and more glorious redemption discovered to him, which God would work out for his church in the latter days. Those who would be acquainted with Christ and his grace, must be much in prayer. The evening offering was a type of the great sacrifice Christ was to offer in the evening of the world: in virtue of that sacrifice Daniel's prayer was accepted; and for the sake of that, this glorious discovery of redeeming love was made to him. We have, in verses 24-27, one of the most remarkable prophecies of Christ, of his coming and his salvation. It shows that the Jews are guilty of most obstinate unbelief, in expecting another Messiah, so long after the time expressly fixed for his coming. The seventy weeks mean a day for a year, or 490 years. About the end of this period a sacrifice would be offered, making full atonement for sin, and bringing in everlasting righteousness for the complete justification of every believer. Then the Jews, in the crucifixion of Jesus, would commit that crime by which the measure of their guilt would be filled up, and troubles would come upon their nation. All blessings bestowed on sinful man come through Christ's atoning sacrifice, who suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God. Here is our way of access to the throne of grace, and of our entrance to heaven. This seals the sum of prophecy, and confirms the covenant with many; and while we rejoice in the blessings of salvation, we should remember what they cost the Redeemer. How can those escape who neglect so great salvation!</body></html>
