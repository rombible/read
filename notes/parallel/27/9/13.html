There had been plenty of external show of praying, as appears from Isaiah 1 and elsewhere, but these prayers were of no effect on account of their formalism. The conditions of acceptable prayer are implied in the closing words of the verse "turning from iniquity, and wisdom in the truth," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in the revelation of God. On the phrase "make prayer," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-11.htm" title="And Moses sought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why does your wrath wax hot against your people, which you have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?">Exodus 32:11</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth</span>. The LXX. renders "laws," <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, "covenant," which is applied to the "Law" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-20.htm">Hebrews 9:20</a>, quoting from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-8.htm">Exodus 24:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-1.htm">Deuteronomy 29:1</a>). Theodotion agrees in the main with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta differs only in joining the first clause of the next verse to this. Ewald makes the prenominal suffix at the end of the verse third person, not second. The very awkwardness of the construction is an evidence in favour of the received reading, "As it is written in the Law of Moses." The passages referred to are those denoted previously (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.). <span class="accented">All this evil is come upon us</span> - the curses referred to there. <span class="accented">Yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God</span>; literally, <span class="accented">entreat the face.</span> The face being the sign of favour, "entreated not the favour of the Lord" would be really what is meant; therefore not quite as Ewald renders, "appeased not Jahve." <span class="accented">Understand thy truth.</span> Hitzig thinks here the reference is to God's faithfulness, either in promises or in threats. Keil objects to this, contending that <span class="accented">baamitheka</span> with the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b5;</span> cannot mean "faithfulness," but" truth." This is a mistake; the preposition might alter the significance of the verb it follows, but not that of the noun it governs. The truth is that the word here is extended to its fullest meaning, "God's supreme reality." God's being God implies necessarily that every word he utters of promise or threatening is true; veracity and faithfulness are equally involved in Jehovah being God. At the same time, from the connection it is the evil - the judgments - he had threatened that bulk most largely in the prophet's mind. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:4-19 In every prayer we must make confession, not only of the sins we have been guilty of, but of our faith in God, and dependence upon him, our sorrow for sin, and our resolutions against it. It must be our confession, the language of our convictions. Here is Daniel's humble, serious, devout address to God; in which he gives glory to him as a God to be feared, and as a God to be trusted. We should, in prayer, look both at God's greatness and his goodness, his majesty and mercy. Here is a penitent confession of sin, the cause of the troubles the people for so many years groaned under. All who would find mercy must thus confess their sins. Here is a self-abasing acknowledgment of the righteousness of God; and it is evermore the way of true penitents thus to justify God. Afflictions are sent to bring men to turn from their sins, and to understand God's truth. Here is a believing appeal to the mercy of God. It is a comfort that God has been always ready to pardon sin. It is encouraging to recollect that mercies belong to God, as it is convincing and humbling to recollect that righteousness belongs to him. There are abundant mercies in God, not only forgiveness, but forgivenesses. Here are pleaded the reproach God's people was under, and the ruins God's sanctuary was in. Sin is a reproach to any people, especially to God's people. The desolations of the sanctuary are grief to all the saints. Here is an earnest request to God to restore the poor captive Jews to their former enjoyments. O Lord, hearken and do. Not hearken and speak only, but hearken and do; do that for us which none else can do; and defer not. Here are several pleas and arguments to enforce the petitions. Do it for the Lord Christ's sake; Christ is the Lord of all. And for his sake God causes his face to shine upon sinners when they repent, and turn to him. In all our prayers this must be our plea, we must make mention of his righteousness, even of his only. The humble, fervent, believing earnestness of this prayer should ever be followed by us.</body></html>
