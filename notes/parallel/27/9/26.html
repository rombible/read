Observe the care with which the seventy weeks are arranged in a series of the form 7 + 62 + 1. During the period of seven weeks Jerusalem is to be rebuilt. The "troublous times" are not to be restricted to this period, but may apply to the sixty-two weeks which follow. After the end of the sixty-nine weeks Messiah is to be cut off. By "Messiah" we must understand the same person who is spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-25.htm" title="Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem to the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and three score and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.">Daniel 9:25</a>. It should also be observed that the word "prince," which is applied to Messiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-25.htm" title="Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem to the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and three score and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.">Daniel 9:25</a>, is here used of another person--some secular prince, who stands in opposition to the Messiah. The Greek versions render "unction" instead of "anointed," whence Jacob of Edessa explains "the cutting off" to mean "the cessation of the unction by which judgment and sovereignty were established." The word "to cut off," however, applies to a person more appropriately than to a thing. It is frequently used of excommunication, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-33.htm" title="Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it on a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.">Exodus 30:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-38.htm" title="Whoever shall make like to that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.">Exodus 30:38</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-9.htm" title="For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait on the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.">Psalm 37:9</a>, and must not be mistaken for the word "to cut off" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-8.htm" title="He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.">Isaiah 53:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">But not for himself.--</span>On the marginal rendering comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-30.htm" title="Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.">John 14:30</a>. Literally the words mean, <span class= "ital">and He has not,</span> but what it is that He loses is left indefinite. Taking the sense according to the context, the meaning is either that He has no more a people, or that His office of Messiah amongst His people ceases.<p><span class= "bld">That shall come.</span>--These words imply coming with hostile intent, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-1.htm" title="In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and besieged it.">Daniel 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-10.htm" title="But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.">Daniel 11:10</a>. Two such princes have been already mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-23.htm" title="Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.">Daniel 7:23</a>, &c., <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-23.htm" title="And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.">Daniel 8:23</a>, &c.), the one being Antiochus, the other his great antitype, namely, Antichrist. Are we to identify this "prince" with either of these? Apparently not. Another typical prince is here introduced to our notice, who shall destroy the city and the sanctuary after the "cutting off" or rejection of the Messiah. But it must be noticed that the work of destruction is here attributed to the "people," and not to the "prince."<p><span class= "bld">The end thereof.--</span>It is not clear what end or whose end is signified. According to grammatical rules, the possessive pronoun may either refer to "sanctuary, the last substantive, or to "prince," the chief nominative in the sentence. The use of the word "flood" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-22.htm" title="And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflowed from before him, and shall be broken; yes, also the prince of the covenant.">Daniel 11:22</a>) (comp. "overflow," <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-26.htm" title="Yes, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.">Daniel 11:26</a>) makes it, at first sight, more plausible to think of the end of a person than of a thing. (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-8.htm" title="But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.">Nahum 1:8</a>.) But upon comparing this clause with the following, it appears that by "the end" is meant the whole issue of the invasion. This is stated to be desolation, such as is caused by a deluge.<p><span class= "bld">Unto the end.--</span>That is, until the end of the seventy weeks, desolations are decreed. The words recall <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/10-22.htm" title="For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.">Isaiah 10:22-23</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:20-27 An answer was immediately sent to Daniel's prayer, and it is a very memorable one. We cannot now expect that God should send answers to our prayers by angels, but if we pray with fervency for that which God has promised, we may by faith take the promise as an immediate answer to the prayer; for He is faithful that has promised. Daniel had a far greater and more glorious redemption discovered to him, which God would work out for his church in the latter days. Those who would be acquainted with Christ and his grace, must be much in prayer. The evening offering was a type of the great sacrifice Christ was to offer in the evening of the world: in virtue of that sacrifice Daniel's prayer was accepted; and for the sake of that, this glorious discovery of redeeming love was made to him. We have, in verses 24-27, one of the most remarkable prophecies of Christ, of his coming and his salvation. It shows that the Jews are guilty of most obstinate unbelief, in expecting another Messiah, so long after the time expressly fixed for his coming. The seventy weeks mean a day for a year, or 490 years. About the end of this period a sacrifice would be offered, making full atonement for sin, and bringing in everlasting righteousness for the complete justification of every believer. Then the Jews, in the crucifixion of Jesus, would commit that crime by which the measure of their guilt would be filled up, and troubles would come upon their nation. All blessings bestowed on sinful man come through Christ's atoning sacrifice, who suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God. Here is our way of access to the throne of grace, and of our entrance to heaven. This seals the sum of prophecy, and confirms the covenant with many; and while we rejoice in the blessings of salvation, we should remember what they cost the Redeemer. How can those escape who neglect so great salvation!</body></html>
