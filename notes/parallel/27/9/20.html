He had not even finished his prayer when the answer came. The angel Gabriel, whom he had seen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-16.htm" title="And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.">Daniel 8:16</a>), comes to him, and reveals to him the mystery of the seventy weeks.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20, 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God; yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.</span> All the versions are practically in agreement with the Massoretic text, save that none of them gives the hophal meaning, "caused to fly swiftly;" the nearest approach being in the Septuagint, in which we have <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. All, however, derive the word from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>, "to fly;" another etymology is possible from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>. As to the meaning of this word, there is a difference of opinion, Gesenius holding that it means "wearied out" - a meaning unsuited to the subject or to the context, though in accordance with the use of the word elsewhere. Meinbold would connect this word with the preceding clause, and refer it to Daniel, "when I was faint." The main difficulty is the succeeding word. Furst suggests that it means "shining in splendour" - a meaning perfectly suited to the circumstances, but for which there seems little justification in etymology from cognate tongues. Furst suggests a transposal from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>. Winer gives it, "celeriter ivit, cucurrit." This view is taken by Hitzig, yon Lengerke, and Havernick. Ver. 20 is largely an expansion of the first clause of ver. 21. <span class="accented">Whiles I was speaking</span>, <span class="accented">and praying.</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-15.htm">Genesis 24:15</a>, "And it came to pass, before he had done speaking"). This shows the rapidity of the Divine answer to prayer; even before we ask, "our Father knows what things we have need of." <span class="accented">The man Gabriel.</span> The name Gabriel, as mentioned above, means "Hero of God;" and the word here translated "man" is the ordinary word for "man," '<span class="accented">ish.</span> It may be remarked that in Scripture angels are always "men;" never, as in modern art and poetry, "women." <span class="accented">Whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning.</span> This really means "whom I had seen previously in vision," the reference being to <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16</a>. <span class="accented">Being caused to fly swiftly. As</span> above mentioned, there is considerable difficulty in deciding which meaning is to be taken as the correct. Kliefoth's and Meinhold's view would be the simplest, if there were any certainty that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e2;&#x5e4;</span> means "faintness." <span class="accented">Touched me about the time of the evening oblation.</span> Daniel is so absorbed in his devotions that not till Gabriel touched him did he recognize the presence of an an gel-visitant. The time of the evening offering does not imply that those offerings were made in Babylon, but simply that, through the half-century that had intervened since the capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar the sacred hour had been kept in remembrance, not impossibly as being one consecrated to prayer. Daniel had been using this season to make known his request and petition to God. "Oblation," <span class="accented">minhah</span>, the bloodless meat offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1, 4, 14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:20-27 An answer was immediately sent to Daniel's prayer, and it is a very memorable one. We cannot now expect that God should send answers to our prayers by angels, but if we pray with fervency for that which God has promised, we may by faith take the promise as an immediate answer to the prayer; for He is faithful that has promised. Daniel had a far greater and more glorious redemption discovered to him, which God would work out for his church in the latter days. Those who would be acquainted with Christ and his grace, must be much in prayer. The evening offering was a type of the great sacrifice Christ was to offer in the evening of the world: in virtue of that sacrifice Daniel's prayer was accepted; and for the sake of that, this glorious discovery of redeeming love was made to him. We have, in verses 24-27, one of the most remarkable prophecies of Christ, of his coming and his salvation. It shows that the Jews are guilty of most obstinate unbelief, in expecting another Messiah, so long after the time expressly fixed for his coming. The seventy weeks mean a day for a year, or 490 years. About the end of this period a sacrifice would be offered, making full atonement for sin, and bringing in everlasting righteousness for the complete justification of every believer. Then the Jews, in the crucifixion of Jesus, would commit that crime by which the measure of their guilt would be filled up, and troubles would come upon their nation. All blessings bestowed on sinful man come through Christ's atoning sacrifice, who suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God. Here is our way of access to the throne of grace, and of our entrance to heaven. This seals the sum of prophecy, and confirms the covenant with many; and while we rejoice in the blessings of salvation, we should remember what they cost the Redeemer. How can those escape who neglect so great salvation!</body></html>
