Two passages occur in that prophet's writings where the duration of the Captivity is mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-11.htm" title="And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.">Jeremiah 25:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-10.htm" title="For thus said the LORD, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.">Jeremiah 29:10</a>), to the former of which Daniel refers (see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-9.htm" title="To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;">Daniel 9:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/9-11.htm" title="Yes, all Israel have transgressed your law, even by departing, that they might not obey your voice; therefore the curse is poured on us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.">Daniel 9:11-12</a>). It will be observed that there existed at this time a collection of sacred books, consisting of what had been already admitted into the Canon.<p><span class= "bld">Seventy years.</span>--It appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-2.htm" title="Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that the LORD's house should be built.">Haggai 1:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-12.htm" title="Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which you have had indignation these three score and ten years?">Zechariah 1:12</a>, that considerable uncertainty prevailed as to the time whence the seventy years were to be reckoned. It has been pointed out (Professor Leathes' <span class= "ital">Old Testament Prophecy,</span> p. 179) that three periods of seventy years occur in connection with the Captivity:--(1) from B.C. 606, the date of Jeremiah's prophecy, to B.C. 536, the edict of Cyrus; (2) from B.C. 598, Jehoiachin's captivity, to B.C. 528, the period of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-6.htm" title="And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they to him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.">Ezra 4:6</a>; (3) from B.C. 588, the destruction of the Temple, to <span class= "ital">B.C. 5</span>18, the edict of Darius (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-1.htm" title="Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.">Ezra 6:1</a>). In the first year of Cyrus, seventy years had elapsed since the captivity of Daniel, but to him it was a question of melancholy importance whether his computation had begun at the right date.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-3 Daniel learned from the books of the prophets, especially from Jeremiah, that the desolation of Jerusalem would continue seventy years, which were drawing to a close. God's promises are to encourage our prayers, not to make them needless; and when we see the performance of them approaching, we should more earnestly plead them with God.</body></html>
