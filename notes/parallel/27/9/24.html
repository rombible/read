Possibly, also, the language (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-2.htm" title="In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.">Daniel 10:2</a>, margin "weeks of days") implies that "weeks of days" are not intended here. On the other hand, it is remarkable that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/25-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses in mount Sinai, saying,">Leviticus 25:1-10</a> the word week should not have been used to signify a period of seven years, if year-weeks are implied in this passage. However, it is generally assumed that we must understand the weeks to consist of years and not of days (see Pusey's <span class= "ital">Daniel,</span> pp. 165, 166), the principle of year-weeks depending upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-34.htm" title="After the number of the days in which you searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall you bear your iniquities, even forty years, and you shall know my breach of promise.">Numbers 14:34</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-34.htm" title="Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate, and you be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.">Leviticus 26:34</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-6.htm" title="And when you have accomplished them, lie again on your right side, and you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed you each day for a year.">Ezekiel 4:6</a>. The word "week" in itself furnishes a clue to the meaning. It implies a "Heptad," and is not necessarily more definite than the "time" mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm" title="And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.">Daniel 7:25</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Are determined.--</span>The word only occurs in this passage. Theod. translates <span class= "greekheb">????????????</span><span class= "ital">;</span> LXX., <span class= "greekheb">?????????</span>; Jer. "<span class= "ital">abbreviat? sunt</span>." In Chaldee the word means "to cut," and in that sense "to determine."<p>The object "determined" is twofold: (1) transgression and sin; (2) reconciliation and righteousness.<p><span class= "bld">To finish.</span>--The Hebrew margin gives an alternative rendering, "to restrain," according to which the meaning is "to hold sin back" and to "prevent it from spreading." If this reading is adopted it will be parallel to the second marginal alternative, "to seal up," which also implies that the iniquity can no more increase. Although the alternative readings may be most in accordance with the Babylonian idea of "sealing sins," the presence of the word "to seal" in the last clause of the verse makes it more probable that the marginal readings are due to the conjectures of some early critics, than that they once stood in the text. However, it must be observed that while St. Jerome translates the passage "<span class= "ital">ut consummetur pr?varicatio, et finem habeat peccatum</span>," Theodotion supports the marginal reading "to seal."<p><span class= "bld">To make reconciliation</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, atonement. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-6.htm" title="By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.">Proverbs 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-7.htm" title="And he laid it on my mouth, and said, See, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin purged.">Isaiah 6:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-9.htm" title="By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he makes all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.">Isaiah 27:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-38.htm" title="But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yes, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.">Psalm 78:38</a>.) The two former clauses show that during the seventy weeks sin will cease. The prophet now brings out another side of the subject. There will be abundance of forgiveness in store for those who are willing to receive it.<p><span class= "bld">Everlasting righteousness.--</span>A phrase not occurring elsewhere. The prophet seems to be combining the notions of "righteousness" and "eternity," which elsewhere are characteristics of Messianic prophecy. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-13.htm" title="I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.">Isaiah 46:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/51-5.htm" title="My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and my arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait on me, and on my arm shall they trust.">Isaiah 51:5-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-36.htm" title="His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.">Psalm 89:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-44.htm" title="And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.">Daniel 2:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-18.htm" title="But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.">Daniel 7:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-27.htm" title="And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.">Daniel 7:27</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">To Seal Up.--</span><span class= "greekheb">?????????</span><span class= "ital">,</span> Theod.; <span class= "greekheb">?????????????</span>, LXX.; <span class= "ital">impleatur,</span> Jer.; the impression of the translators being that all visions and prophecies were to receive their complete fulfilment in the course of these seventy weeks. It appears, however, to be more agreeable to the context to suppose that the prophet is speaking of the absolute cessation of all prophecy. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-8.htm" title="Charity never fails: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.">1Corinthians 13:8</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">To anoint the most Holy.--</span>The meaning of the sentence depends upon the interpretation of the words "Most Holy" or "Holy of Holies." In Scripture they are used of (1) the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-37.htm" title="Seven days you shall make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatever touches the altar shall be holy.">Exodus 29:37</a>); (2) the atonement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-10.htm" title="And Aaron shall make an atonement on the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement on it throughout your generations: it is most holy to the LORD.">Exodus 30:10</a>); (3) the tabernacle and the sacred furniture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-29.htm" title="And you shall sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatever touches them shall be holy.">Exodus 30:29</a>); (4) the sacred perfume (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-36.htm" title="And you shall beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with you: it shall be to you most holy.">Exodus 30:36</a>); (5) the remnant of the meat offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-3.htm" title="And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.">Leviticus 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-10.htm" title="And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.">Leviticus 2:10</a>); (6) all that touch the offerings made by fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-18.htm" title="All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that touches them shall be holy.">Leviticus 6:18</a>); (7) the sin offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-17.htm" title="Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God has given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?">Leviticus 10:17</a>); (8) the trespass offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-13.htm" title="And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering is the priest's, so is the trespass offering: it is most holy:">Leviticus 14:13</a>); (9) the shewbread (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-9.htm" title="And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it is most holy to him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.">Leviticus 24:9</a>); (10) things devoted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-28.htm" title="Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to the LORD of all that he has, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.">Leviticus 27:28</a>); (11) various offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-9.htm" title="This shall be your of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs which they shall render to me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons.">Numbers 18:9</a>); (12) the temple service and articles connected with it, or perhaps Aaron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-13.htm" title="The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister to him, and to bless in his name for ever.">1Chronicles 23:13</a>); (13) the limits of the new temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-12.htm" title="This is the law of the house; On the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.">Ezekiel 43:12</a>); (14) the sanctuary of the new temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-3.htm" title="And of this measure shall you measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place.">Ezekiel 45:3</a>); (15) the territory set apart for the sons of Zadok (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-2.htm" title="And by the border of Dan, from the east side to the west side, a portion for Asher.">Ezekiel 48:2</a>). Which of these significations is to be here adopted can only be discovered by the context. Now from the careful manner in which this and the following verse are connected by the words "Know therefore," it appears that the words "most Holy" are parallel to "Messiah the Prince" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-25.htm" title="Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem to the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and three score and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.">Daniel 9:25</a>), and that they indicate a person. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-18.htm" title="All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that touches them shall be holy.">Leviticus 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-13.htm" title="The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister to him, and to bless in his name for ever.">1Chronicles 23:13</a>.) This was the opinion of the Syriac translator, who renders the words "Messiah the most Holy," and of the LXX. <span class= "greekheb">???????? ????? ?????</span><span class= "ital">,</span> on which it has been remarked that <span class= "greekheb">????????</span> would have no meaning if applied to a place, and the phrase employed in this version for the sanctuary is invariably <span class= "greekheb">?? ????? ??? ?????</span>. Any reference to Zerubbabel's temple, or to the dedication of the temple by Judas Maccabaeus, is opposed to the context.<p><span class= "bld">EXCURSUS G: THE SEVENTY WEEKS (Daniel 9:24).</span><p>It may be questioned in what way this prophecy presents any meaning to those who follow the punctuation of the Hebrew text, and put the principal stop in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-25.htm" title="Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem to the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and three score and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.">Daniel 9:25</a> after "seven weeks," instead of after "three score and two weeks." The translation would be as follows, "From the going out . . . until Messiah the prince shall be seven weeks; and during sixty-two weeks the city shall be rebuilt . . . and after sixty-two weeks shall Messiah be cut off" . . . This can only be explained upon the hypothesis that the word "week" is used in an indefinite sense to mean a period. The sense is then as follows:--The period from the command of Cyrus or of Artaxerxes to rebuild Jerusalem, down to the time of Messiah, consisted of seven such weeks; during the sixty-two weeks that followed the kingdom of Messiah is to be established amidst much persecution. During the last week the persecution will be so intense that Messiah may be said to be annihilated by it, His kingdom on earth being destroyed. At the end of the last week the Antichristian prince who organises the persecution is himself exterminated, and destroyed in the final judgment.<p>According to this view the seventy weeks occupy the whole period that intervenes between the times of Cyrus or Artaxerxes and the last judgment. The principal objection to it is that it gives no explanation of the numbers "seven" and "sixty-two," which seem to have been chosen for some particular purpose. Nor does it furnish any reason for the choice of the word "weeks" instead of "times" or "seasons," either of which words would have equally served the same indefinite purpose.<p>The traditional interpretation follows the punctuation of Theodotion, which St. Jerome also adopted, and reckons the seventy weeks from B.C. 458, the twentieth year of Artaxerxes. From this date, measuring seven weeks of years--that is, forty-nine years--we are brought to the date B.C. 409. It is predicted that during this period the walls of Jerusalem and the city itself should be rebuilt, though in troublous times. It must be remembered that very little is known of Jewish history during the times after Ezra and Nehemiah. The latest date given in Nehemiah is the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, or B.C. 446. It is highly probable that the city was not completely restored till nearly forty years later. Reckoning from B.C. 409 sixty-two weeks or 434 years, we are brought to A.D. 25, the year when our Saviour began His ministry. After three and a half years, or in the "midst of a week," he was cut off. The seventy weeks end in A.D. 32, which is said to be the end of the second probation of Israel after rejecting the Messiah. The agreement between the dates furnished by history and prediction is very striking, and the general expectation that there prevailed about the appearance of a Messiah at the time of our Saviour's first advent points to the antiquity as well as to the accuracy of the interpretation. However, the explanation of the latter half of the seven weeks is not satisfactory. We have no chronological account of events which occurred shortly after the Ascension, and there are no facts stated in the New Testament that lead us to suppose that Israel should have three and a half years' probation after the rejection of the Messiah.<p>The modern explanation adheres in part to the Masoretic text, and regards the sixty-two year-weeks as beginning in B.C. 604. Reckoning onwards 434 years, we are brought to the year B.C. 170, in which Antiochus plundered the Temple and massacred 40,000 Jews. Onias III., the anointed prince, was murdered B.C. 176, just before the close of this period; and from the attack upon the Temple to the death of Antiochus, B.C. 164. was seven years, or one week, in the midst of which, B.C. 167, the offering was abolished, and the idolatrous altar erected in the Temple. The seven weeks are then calculated onwards from B.C. 166, and are stated to mean an indefinite period expressed by a round number, during which Jerusalem was rebuilt after its defilement by Antiochus. This explanation is highly unsatisfactory. It not only inverts the order of the weeks, but arbitrarily uses the word week in a double sense, in a definite and in an indefinite sense at once. There is still a graver objection to assuming that the starting point of the seventy weeks is the year B.C. 604. No command to rebuild Jerusalem had then gone forth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy.</span> The LXX. here differs from the above, "Seventy weeks are determined (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) upon thy people and the city Zion, to make an end of sin, to make unrighteousnesses rare (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), and to wipe out the unrighteous-nesses, and to understand the vision, and to give (appoint) (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) everlasting righteousness, and to end the visions and the prophet, and to rejoice the holy of holies." There seem here to be some instances of doublet: <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> are different renderings of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">lehathaym hattaoth</span>), or as it is in the <span class="accented">Q'ri</span>, <span class="accented">leahthaym hattath</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d7;</span>). Neither of these seems to be the original of the Greek. Schleusner suggests to read <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Against this is the fact that Paulus Tellensis renders <span class="accented">lemaz'or</span>, "to bring to nothing" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-24.htm">Jeremiah 10:24</a>, Peshitta). How Wolf ('Siebzigwochen,' p. 26) can say the LXX. confirms the Massoretic K'thib, is difficult to see. The author of the first rendering of this phrase seems to have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5ea;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">ha</span>-<span class="accented">thath</span>) instead of <span class="accented">hatham</span>; the other translator must have read <span class="accented">mahah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>). The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to understand the vision," seems a doublet of the clause, "to seal up the vision." There seems to have been in one of the manuscripts used by the LXX. translator a transposition of words; for one of them must have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">lehoothan</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>, since he renders <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. This is an impossible change, but the mistaking of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d7;&#x5dd;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5ea;&#x5df;</span> is perfectly easy to imagine, if <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span> had been written in place of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>, and it transferred to the place in the Massoretic text occupied by <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;</span>, then we can easily understand <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>. In the last clause the LXX. translator must have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5de;&#x5d7;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5d7;</span>, a clearly inferior reading. The impression conveyed to one is that the translators were able to put no intelligible meaning on the passage, and rendered the words successively as nearly as they could without attempting to make them sense. We must admit, however, that the phenomena that cause this impression may be due to corruption of the text. Theodotion renders, "Seventy weeks are determined (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) upon thy people and on the holy city, to seal sins and wipe away unrighteousness, and to atone for sin, and to bring the everlasting righteousness, and to seal the vision and the prophet, and to anoint the holy of holies." Theodotion, it will be seen, as the LXX., has "prophet" instead of "prophecy," which certainly is more verbally accurate than our version; he omits "to finish transgression," having instead, "to seal sins." The Peshitta has followed the K'thib and renders, "finish transgressions," and instead of "prophecy" has the "prophets." The text of the Vetus, as preserved to us by Tertullian, is, "Seventy weeks are shortened (<span class="accented">breviatae</span>) upon thy people, and upon the holy city, until sin shall grow old, and iniquities be marked (<span class="accented">signentur</span>), and righteousnesses rise up, and eternal righteousness be brought in, and that the vision and the prophet should be marked (<span class="accented">signetur</span>), and the holy of holies (<span class="accented">sanctus sanctorum</span>) be anointed." Jerome renders, "Seventy weeks are shortened (<span class="accented">abbreviate sunt</span>)<span class="accented">upon</span> thy people and upon thy holy city, to end falsehood (<span class="accented">prevarieatio</span>), to end sin, to wipe out iniquity, to bring in the everlasting righteousness, to fulfil the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the holy of holies (<span class="accented">sanctus sanctorum</span>)." The Hebrew here is peculiar; the word for "weeks" is in the masculine, which is unexampled elsewhere in the plural. The singular masculine is found, <span class="accented">e.g</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-27.htm">Genesis 29:27</a>; there is no case of feminine singular. Mr. Galloway ('Shadow on the Sundial,' p. 51) would read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5bb;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5bb;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, and would render, "by weeks it is determined." There seems little evidence for this reading; against a few late manuscripts is the consensus of versions. "Determined" is also a word that occurs only Lore; it is Aramaic, but not common even in that language. It means "to cut off." It may thus refer to these weeks being "cut off" from time generally; hence "determined." It is singular, and its nominative is plural. "To finish" also causes difficulty; so translated, it implies that the word should be written <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>; but it is written <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, which means "to restrain," "to enclose," "to separate off" (Furst). Hence if we translate as it stands, it should be "restrain transgression." "To make an end of" in also "cause transgression to cease" This in a rendering of the Massoretic Q'ri; if the K'thib had been taken, the translation should rather have been "to seal." "Sins:" this word is plural in the K'thib, but singular in the Q'ri. A large number of manuscripts write the word plural; the Greek versions give the plural; the Pe-shista and Vulgate, Aquila and Paulus Tellensis, singular. "The prophecy," it is clearly an it stands "the prophet." Jerome is the only one of the versions that takes the word in the sense in which it is taken in our versions. Professor Bevan renders it "prophet" (so Hitzig and Hengstenberg). One is tempted to adopt the reading of Michaelis <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d6;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d7;&#x5e0;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>, "the vision of the prophet," which has some manuscript authority (Wolf, 'Siebzigwochen,' p. 15). The overwhelming mass of evidence is in favour of the present consonantal text. <span class="accented">Seventy weeks.</span> "Week," while generally a week of days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-2.htm">Daniel 10:2</a>), was occasionally week of years, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-27.htm">Genesis 29:27</a>, "fulfil the week of this," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the seven years of service. Among the later Jews this became a recognized mode of reckoning, as in the Book of Jubilees, each jubilee in divided into successive weeks. From what follows it is necessary that the weeks here are sevens of years. "Are determined," as already indicated, means "cut off," not "shortened," which does not seem to be the meaning of the word in any case. "Upon thy people and upon thy holy city." Daniel has been praying long and earnestly for his people; so there would be no inability to see what was meant by "his city and his people." "To finish transgression" is equivalent to "to restrain transgression." Transgression is apt to become bold and imperious; it is a great deal when it is even somewhat "restrained." It is to be noted that, as Daniel's prayer was greatly confession of the sins of the people and prayer for forgiveness, the promises here are largely moral; but still the Messianic period even was not to be expected to be one in which there will be no sin - it is to be restrained. "To make an end of sins" - though "to seal sins" seems the better reading diplomatically it is the K'thib, and that of some of the versions. It is difficult to give the phrase an intelligible meaning. Moreover, the occurrence of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span> so immediately after is against it. Something may be said for <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d7;&#x5d4;</span>, which occurs in a similar connection with <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5de;&#x5dd;</span> that this does in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-22.htm">Lamentations 4:22</a>. This is the reading of one of the translators in the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> - the spirit of lawlessness would be restrained and the past iniquities and their guilt wiped away. "To make reconciliation " - "to make an atonement." The verb used is the technical word, "the offering of an atoning sacrifice." In this sense it occurs some fifty times in Leviticus. This might apply to the renewal of sacrificial offerings in the temple after the fifty years' cessation during the Babylonian captivity, or to the renewal after the shorter cessation under the oppression inflicted on the Jews under Epiphanes. The next clause implies a wider application and a loftier sacrifice. Professor Bevan is right in maintaining that, despite the accents, this clause is to be connected with the next. <span class="accented">To</span> <span class="accented">bring in everlasting righteousness.</span> This is more than merely the termination of the suit of God against his people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-9.htm">Isaiah 27:9</a>). The phrase occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-142.htm">Psalm 119:142</a>, and is applied to the righteousness of God. These two, "atonement for sin" and "the everlasting righteousness," are found in Christ - his atoning death and the righteousness which he brings into the world. It is true that when Daniel heard these words spoken by Gabriel he might not put any very distinct meaning on them - in that he was but like other prophets; the prophets did not know the meaning of their own prophecies. <span class="accented">To seal up the vision and prophecy</span>; more correctly, <span class="accented">to seal vision and prophet - to</span> set to them the seal of fulfilment (von Lengerke, Hitzig, Bevan). This does not refer to Jeremiah, because his prophecy referred merely to the return from Babylon, and this refers to a period which is to continue long after that. Jeremiah's prophecy was about to be verified. This new prophecy required four hundred and ninety years ere it received its verification. Some event to happen nearly half a millennium after Daniel is to prove the prophecy God has given him to be true. <span class="accented">And to anoint the Most Holy.</span> This phrase, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (<span class="accented">qodesh qodasheem</span>), is used some forty times in Scripture, but almost always of things, as the altar and the innermost sanctuary (Bevan, 155). Hengstenberg ('Christ.,' 3:119) points out that the phrase for "sanctuary" is "<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;</span>, with the article. He appeals to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-13.htm">1 Chronicles 23:13</a> as a case where, without the article, the phrase applies to an individual, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">vayibba-dayl Aheron leheqdeesho qodesh qadasheem</span>), "And he separated Aaron to sanctify him as a holy of holies." This seems almost the necessary translation, despite the versions; for the prenominal suffix must be the object, and "holy of holies" must be in apposition to it. The act of anointing as a sign of consecration, though applied to the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-26.htm">Exodus 30:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-9.htm">Exodus 40:9</a>), to the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-10.htm">Exodus 40:10</a>), the laver (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-11.htm">Exodus 40:11</a>), is never applied to the holy of holies. It is applied most frequently to persons; as to Aaron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-13.htm">Exodus 40:13</a>), to Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>), to David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-3.htm">1 Samuel 16:3</a>). The words of Gabriel thus point forward to a time when all iniquity shall be restrained, sin atoned for, and a priest anointed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:20-27 An answer was immediately sent to Daniel's prayer, and it is a very memorable one. We cannot now expect that God should send answers to our prayers by angels, but if we pray with fervency for that which God has promised, we may by faith take the promise as an immediate answer to the prayer; for He is faithful that has promised. Daniel had a far greater and more glorious redemption discovered to him, which God would work out for his church in the latter days. Those who would be acquainted with Christ and his grace, must be much in prayer. The evening offering was a type of the great sacrifice Christ was to offer in the evening of the world: in virtue of that sacrifice Daniel's prayer was accepted; and for the sake of that, this glorious discovery of redeeming love was made to him. We have, in verses 24-27, one of the most remarkable prophecies of Christ, of his coming and his salvation. It shows that the Jews are guilty of most obstinate unbelief, in expecting another Messiah, so long after the time expressly fixed for his coming. The seventy weeks mean a day for a year, or 490 years. About the end of this period a sacrifice would be offered, making full atonement for sin, and bringing in everlasting righteousness for the complete justification of every believer. Then the Jews, in the crucifixion of Jesus, would commit that crime by which the measure of their guilt would be filled up, and troubles would come upon their nation. All blessings bestowed on sinful man come through Christ's atoning sacrifice, who suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God. Here is our way of access to the throne of grace, and of our entrance to heaven. This seals the sum of prophecy, and confirms the covenant with many; and while we rejoice in the blessings of salvation, we should remember what they cost the Redeemer. How can those escape who neglect so great salvation!</body></html>
