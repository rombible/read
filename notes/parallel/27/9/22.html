The angel gave Daniel understanding in the perplexing words of Jeremiah, showing him that what affected his people was a period of seventy weeks that were yet to come, rather than seventy years which were already passed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding</span>. The LXX. and Peshitta render the first clause, "And he approached and talked with me." It is difficult to understand how that reading could have arisen from the Massoretic text, or how, on the other hand, the Massoretie text could have arisen from that behind the Septuagint. The rendering of the Septuagint in the last clause is better than that in our Authorized Version, and is in accordance with our Revised, "to make thee skilful of understanding." Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic. Although Daniel was highly endowed, and although he had before him the inspired words of Jeremiah, he had need of yet higher endowments to understand the secrets of the Divine plan. He knew that if he reckoned seventy years from the time when he himself had been carried captive, then the period was drawing to a close: but the <span class="accented">sins</span> of the people were still there. It might be that God would restrain the fulfilment of his promise; the more so that, if the prophecy of Jeremiah were reckoned from the fall of Jerusalem, twenty years would yet have to run. Daniel is concerned about the <span class="accented">sins</span> of his people, knowing that, unless they were removed, renewed punishment would befall them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to show thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision</span>. The version of the LXX. differs somewhat from this, "In the beginning of thy prayer a commandment came from the Lord, and I came to show thee, because thou art merciful, and do thou understand (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) the command." The other versions do not present much worthy of remark. <span class="accented">At the beginning of thy supplications.</span> This affords a reason why it was while Daniel "was yet speaking," that Gabriel came to him; the moment the desire was strong enough to shape itself in words, the answer was on the way. <span class="accented">The commandment came forth.</span> The word translated "commandment" is the very common Hebrew word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">dabar</span>), "a word," "a thing," "a matter," in which sense it occurs in the penultimate clause of this verse. <span class="accented">And I am come to show thee.</span> The angel Gabriel is the messenger sent forth to interpret to Daniel the ways of God with his people. The angel Gabriel is sent to give Daniel an explanatory oracle or word that he may be comforted concerning his people. The reason of this is, "for thou art greatly beloved." This phrase has caused considerable difference of opinion. The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>; Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>; the Peshitta, <span class="accented">regee</span>; Jerome, <span class="accented">vir desideriorum</span>; Hitzig's rendering is "darling" (<span class="accented">liebling</span>); Ewald, "dearly beloved one." <span class="accented">Hemoodoth</span> means "desires," "loves;" hence may either be understood subjectively or objectively; in this case, most probably the latter, "a man, the object of love." <span class="accented">Therefore understand the matter</span>, <span class="accented">and consider the vision.</span> The reader will have observed that the last clause is omitted from the LXX. There is a false succession here. Daniel is first commanded "to understand the matter," and then "to consider the vision." Another rendering of the Massoretic avoids this by neglecting the <span class="accented">ethnach</span>, and connecting <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> with the preceding clause, gives, "thou art greatly beloved and understanding in the matter." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:20-27 An answer was immediately sent to Daniel's prayer, and it is a very memorable one. We cannot now expect that God should send answers to our prayers by angels, but if we pray with fervency for that which God has promised, we may by faith take the promise as an immediate answer to the prayer; for He is faithful that has promised. Daniel had a far greater and more glorious redemption discovered to him, which God would work out for his church in the latter days. Those who would be acquainted with Christ and his grace, must be much in prayer. The evening offering was a type of the great sacrifice Christ was to offer in the evening of the world: in virtue of that sacrifice Daniel's prayer was accepted; and for the sake of that, this glorious discovery of redeeming love was made to him. We have, in verses 24-27, one of the most remarkable prophecies of Christ, of his coming and his salvation. It shows that the Jews are guilty of most obstinate unbelief, in expecting another Messiah, so long after the time expressly fixed for his coming. The seventy weeks mean a day for a year, or 490 years. About the end of this period a sacrifice would be offered, making full atonement for sin, and bringing in everlasting righteousness for the complete justification of every believer. Then the Jews, in the crucifixion of Jesus, would commit that crime by which the measure of their guilt would be filled up, and troubles would come upon their nation. All blessings bestowed on sinful man come through Christ's atoning sacrifice, who suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God. Here is our way of access to the throne of grace, and of our entrance to heaven. This seals the sum of prophecy, and confirms the covenant with many; and while we rejoice in the blessings of salvation, we should remember what they cost the Redeemer. How can those escape who neglect so great salvation!</body></html>
