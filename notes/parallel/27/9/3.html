Probably he prayed, as on that occasion, with his face towards Jerusalem.

The true rendering is, as Professor Bevan points out," to set to prayer." Theodotion is nearly as slavish; only he omits "ashes," and has "fastings." The Peshitta is close, but does not follow the change of construction in the last clause. Jerome seems to have read, "my God." The cessation of the temple-worship, with its sacrifices, was naturally fitted to bring prayer as a mode of worship into a prominence it bad not before. Yet we find prayers made while the first temple was yet standing, as the prayer of Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-15.htm">2 Kings 19:15</a>), of Jehoshaphat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-6.htm">2 Chronicles 20:6</a>). The comparison more naturally stands with the prayers of Ezra and Nehemiah<span class="cmt_word">,</span> as the subject of their supplication is similar to that of the prayer before us. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-3 Daniel learned from the books of the prophets, especially from Jeremiah, that the desolation of Jerusalem would continue seventy years, which were drawing to a close. God's promises are to encourage our prayers, not to make them needless; and when we see the performance of them approaching, we should more earnestly plead them with God.</body></html>
