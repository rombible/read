In the midst of his sorrow for the past, the mind of the prophet recurs unconsciously to the great promise of future deliverance by "the root of Jesse."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them. because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee. O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee.</span> The versions are all very close to the Massoretic text. The most important variation is Theodotion's repetition of the first clause of ver. 7 at the beginning of ver. 8. Neither of the English versions brings out the contrast in the Hebrew of the second clause of ver. 7; it is "man," not "men," of Judah. This contrast is observed by Theodotion and Jerome, but not by the LXX. or the Peshitta. These two verses have a strong resemblance to Bar. 1:15, 16, "And ye shall say, To our God <span class="accented">belongeth</span> righteousness, but unto us the confusion of faces, as <span class="accented">it is come to pass</span> this day to man of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to our kings, and to our princes, and to our priests, and to our prophets, and to our fathers." This confession is introduced into the text of Baruch as a quotation. The captives on the river Lud send money to Jerusalem for offerings and sacrifices, and with the money send certain advices. As the circumstances in which the Baruch version purports to be written do not so naturally suit the words used, we can, we think, have no difficulty in recognizing that it is not the primitive recension. The words have the look of a liturgic prayer. The relationship between the present passage and Jeremiah is close; "confusion of face" occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-19.htm">Jeremiah 7:19</a> as well as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-7.htm">Ezra 9:7</a>. The most marked case is the collocation, "man of Judah, and <span class="accented">inbabitants</span> of Jerusalem." This phrase is frequent in Jeremiah; <span class="accented">e.g</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-2.htm">Jeremiah 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-25.htm">Jeremiah 17:25</a>. There is also a resemblance to Ezekiel in the phrase, "their trespass that they have trespassed against thee;" <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-8.htm">Ezekiel 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-27.htm">Ezekiel 20:27</a>. The language thus is in strict dramatic suitability to one who has just been studying the prophets of the Captivity. <span class="accented">To our kings</span>, <span class="accented">to oar princes.</span> This could not be used naturally after the date of Daniel. To him who remembered kings and princes in Judah and Jerusalem, this language is natural. In the age of Epiphanes it would be absurd and meaningless. The phrase is used in the liturgic prayer in Nehemiah, because there is a narrative of the history of the people. When we compare the Psalter of Solomon, we find the only King of Israel is God: yet Alexander Jannseus, who was not long dead when that Psalter was written, had assumed the crown; and his sons had competed for the possession of it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:4-19 In every prayer we must make confession, not only of the sins we have been guilty of, but of our faith in God, and dependence upon him, our sorrow for sin, and our resolutions against it. It must be our confession, the language of our convictions. Here is Daniel's humble, serious, devout address to God; in which he gives glory to him as a God to be feared, and as a God to be trusted. We should, in prayer, look both at God's greatness and his goodness, his majesty and mercy. Here is a penitent confession of sin, the cause of the troubles the people for so many years groaned under. All who would find mercy must thus confess their sins. Here is a self-abasing acknowledgment of the righteousness of God; and it is evermore the way of true penitents thus to justify God. Afflictions are sent to bring men to turn from their sins, and to understand God's truth. Here is a believing appeal to the mercy of God. It is a comfort that God has been always ready to pardon sin. It is encouraging to recollect that mercies belong to God, as it is convincing and humbling to recollect that righteousness belongs to him. There are abundant mercies in God, not only forgiveness, but forgivenesses. Here are pleaded the reproach God's people was under, and the ruins God's sanctuary was in. Sin is a reproach to any people, especially to God's people. The desolations of the sanctuary are grief to all the saints. Here is an earnest request to God to restore the poor captive Jews to their former enjoyments. O Lord, hearken and do. Not hearken and speak only, but hearken and do; do that for us which none else can do; and defer not. Here are several pleas and arguments to enforce the petitions. Do it for the Lord Christ's sake; Christ is the Lord of all. And for his sake God causes his face to shine upon sinners when they repent, and turn to him. In all our prayers this must be our plea, we must make mention of his righteousness, even of his only. The humble, fervent, believing earnestness of this prayer should ever be followed by us.</body></html>
