The words of the voice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-6.htm" title="His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in color to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.">Daniel 10:6</a>) are unrecorded.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I Daniel alone saw the vision; for the men that were with me saw not the vision.; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves.</span> The LXX. in the main <span class="accented">agrees</span> with this, but seems to have read <span class="accented">lemahar</span>, "<span class="accented">in haste</span>," instead of <span class="accented">behayhabay.</span> Theodotion renders the last word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x1ff3;</span>, implying that he read <span class="accented">behaga</span>. The reading of the Massoretic is superior, as being <span class="accented">less</span> expected. The Peshitta renders in accordance with Theodotion. Jerome agrees very exactly with the Massoretic text. <span class="accented">And I Daniel alone saw the vision</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-7.htm">Acts 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-9.htm">Acts 22:9</a>). The Apostle Paul was solitary in hearing intelligible words and seeing Christ; his attendants saw the bright light and heard a voice, but neither saw the speaker nor were able to distinguish the purport of the words. <span class="accented">For the men that were with me saw not the vision.</span> Who those were that were with Daniel we cannot tell; probably they were the ordinary attendants of an officer of rank in the court of the great king. Rashi's idea that they were Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, has no probability in favour of it. As little has Professor Fuller's hint that they were Hananiah, Michael, and Azariah. <span class="accented">But a great quaking fell upon them</span>, <span class="accented">so that they fled to hide themselves</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>). A yet finer parallel is <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-12.htm">Job 4:12-16</a>. Eliphaz there describes a spirit passing before him, although invisible; yet in the horror of contact with the spiritual, all his bones shook and the hair of his flesh stood up. There is a difference to be noted here between the conduct of the attendants of Daniel and those of the Apostle Paul. As we read here, the attendants of Daniel flee to hide themselves, those of the apostle are first struck to the earth and then stand stupefied. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-9. This chapter relates the beginning of Daniel's last vision, which is continued to the end of the book. The time would be long before all would be accomplished; and much of it is not yet fulfilled. Christ appeared to Daniel in a glorious form, and it should engage us to think highly and honourably of him. Let us admire his condescension for us and our salvation. There remained no strength in Daniel. The greatest and best of men cannot bear the full discoveries of the Divine glory; for no man can see it, and live; but glorified saints see Christ as he is, and can bear the sight. How dreadful soever Christ may appear to those under convictions of sin, there is enough in his word to quiet their spirits.</body></html>
