The assuring words thus addressed to the prophet enabled him to stand upright, but his alarm had not as yet subsided.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I dew sent. And when he had spoken this word</span> unto <span class="cmt_word">me, I stood trembling</span>. The versions do not afford cause for remark. O <span class="accented">Daniel</span>, <span class="accented">a man greatly beloved.</span> This is the same term as that applied to Daniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-23.htm">Daniel 9:23</a>), "man of desires" (which see). <span class="accented">Understand the words that I speak unto thee</span>; "have understanding in the words," or <span class="accented">better</span>, "matters, which I am speaking or telling to thee." As the language used was one intelligible to Daniel, it was needless to command him to understand the words, but the "matters" communicated by the words might require a special effort of attention to comprehend. <span class="accented">Debareem</span> means "matters" as well as "words." <span class="accented">And stand upright</span>; "'stand upon thy standing." Gesenius would render this word when it occurs before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>), "place;" but both here and there the contrast is in the attitude. From being absolutely prone, as in the eighth chapter, or on hands and knees as here, he is to be upright, and, <span class="accented">taking</span> his previous attitude into account, this is not merely to stand where he is, and neither approach nor depart. The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>; Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>; the Vulgate has <span class="accented">gradu. For unto thee am I now sent.</span> This assigns a reason for the command to stand upon his feet. In the Assyrian marbles, however lowly the obeisance made to the monarch by any one admitted to his presence, he stands when he receives the monarch's commands. Standing implies attention. <span class="accented">And when he had spoken this word unto me</span>, <span class="accented">I stood trembling.</span> He obeyed the command, but still trembling took hold of him in the angelic presence. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:10-21 Whenever we enter into communion with God, it becomes us to have a due sense of the infinite distance between us and the holy God. How shall we, that are dust and ashes, speak to the Lord of glory? Nothing is more likely, nothing more effectual to revive the drooping spirits of the saints, than to be assured of God's love to them. From the very first day we begin to look toward God in a way of duty, he is ready to meet us in the way of mercy. Thus ready is God to hear prayer. When the angel had told the prophet of the things to come, he was to return, and oppose the decrees of the Persian kings against the Jews. The angels are employed as God's ministering servants, Heb 1:14. Though much was done against the Jews by the kings of Persia, God permitting it, much more mischief would have been done if God had not prevented it. He would now more fully show what were God's purposes, of which the prophecies form an outline; and we are concerned to study what is written in these Scriptures of truth, for they belong to our everlasting peace. While Satan and his angels, and evil counsellors, excite princes to mischief against the church, we may rejoice that Christ our Prince, and all his mighty angels, act against our enemies; but we ought not to expect many to favour us in this evil world. Yet the whole counsel of God shall be established; and let each one pray, Lord Jesus, be our righteousness now, and thou wilt be our everlasting confidence, through life, in death, at the day of judgment, and for evermore.</body></html>
