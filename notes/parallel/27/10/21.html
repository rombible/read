This may be brought out by paraphrasing the verse as follows: "It is true that the prince of Javan will attack you, but do not despair at the thought of one persecuting empire succeeding another. It is all written in the Scripture of truth:" that is, in the revelations which God had already conveyed, or shortly would convey, to Daniel, and in the book of Providence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-16.htm" title="Your eyes did see my substance, yet being imperfect; and in your book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.">Psalm 139:16</a>).

The Septuagint translator read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">hara'sheem</span>), "the heads," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">harashoom</span>), written with a inserted as <span class="accented">mater lectionis.</span> Theodotion is in accordance with our English Version.

The use of it is explained by Kranichfeld and Zockler as due to the fears for the theocracy aroused by the thought that the Greek power was rising against Israel. If the idea had been that Gabriel was called to hurry back to his post because of the threatened approach of the Prince of Grecia, then it might be defended; only even then either the fact of the necessity for speedy return to the Persian court would have been emphasized, or the fact that he is delaying to make known the contents of the writing of truth. It is, perhaps, better rendered by "nevertheless," as it is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-3.htm">2 Chronicles 19:3</a>. We can see the force of this particle by turning to ver. 7, "I Daniel alone saw the vision, for the men that were with me saw not the vision, but (equivalent to 'nevertheless') a great quaking fell upon them." This clause, we see, then, has all the appearance of being intruded violently into the text; it interrupts the progress of thought, and does not suit the context. There is no indication that he, Gabriel, will have to hasten back to the court of Persia with such rapidity as would necessitate the introduction of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">abal</span>), "nevertheless." But even so, why revert in the next clause to the contents of ver. 20, without the slightest indication that the line of thought in the past clause was dropped as soon as taken up? The last clause of this verse reads much better in connection with ver. 20 than with ver. 21<span class="accented">a</span>. Behrmann transposes the clauses in this verse, so as to get over tiffs difficulty, and Professor M. Stuart puts the first clause in brackets. "The scripture of truth" is a phrase that might have been suggested by <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>, "In thy book were all my members written." It is in line with a great number of phrases in apocalyptic literature; thus Enoch 93:1, "And after that Enoch began to recount from the books;" the Book of Jubilees, 1:24; 4:31; 5:15, etc., "the tablets of the heavens." The idea was that all the events that were to happen in the world's history were record, d beforehand in the books or tablets of the heavens. It is from failing to notice this that the late Professor Fuller was led to say "the scripture of truth "is the title for the ensuing section. Against this view is the preposition "in;" it is in the scripture of truth, among other matters, that these things are noted which form the succeeding section. At the same time, the form the representation of the heavenly books, which note beforehand what was to happen, assumes here is simpler than that in Enoch or the Book of Jubilees. <span class="accented">And there is none that holdeth with me in these things</span>, <span class="accented">but Michael your</span> prince. As we have above said, this clause is closely connected with ver. 20. <span class="accented">In these things.</span> This is rendered in the Revised Version "against these," in accordance with the majority of recent commentators, Ewald, Hitzig, Fuller, Zockler, Bevan, Stuart, Kranlohfeld Keil, Kliefoth, Behrmann, etc., and, among older commentators, Jephet-ibn-Ali; but none of the older versions have it. The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; the Peshitta has the preposition; the Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">in his omnibus.</span> With these Calvin agrees, though Luther renders, <span class="accented">wider jene.</span> Certainly, the most common meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> in such a connection is "against." So, notwithstanding the weight of the versions, we feel constrained to translate, "against these persons," and not "in regard to these things." In the first place, "in" is a far less frequent meaning of the preposition, and next, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">aylayh</span>), "these," most naturally refers to the persons last named. Although "the Prince of Grecia" was to be the instrument of the overthrow of the power of Persia, it was to become oppressive afterwards, as had been revealed to Daniel in the vision of the ram and the he-goat. Gabriel, the angel of prophecy, the special guardian of God's great ideal kingdom of heaven, was assisted in his guardianship only by Michael, the angelic Prince of Israel. The fact that along the line of the development of Israel as a nation ran, so far at least, the Divine plan concerning the kingdom of heaven, made it natural that Michael should favour that which furthered the interests of the race that was more specially under his care. As we have already said, we cannot even guess at the nature of these angelic conflicts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:10-21 Whenever we enter into communion with God, it becomes us to have a due sense of the infinite distance between us and the holy God. How shall we, that are dust and ashes, speak to the Lord of glory? Nothing is more likely, nothing more effectual to revive the drooping spirits of the saints, than to be assured of God's love to them. From the very first day we begin to look toward God in a way of duty, he is ready to meet us in the way of mercy. Thus ready is God to hear prayer. When the angel had told the prophet of the things to come, he was to return, and oppose the decrees of the Persian kings against the Jews. The angels are employed as God's ministering servants, Heb 1:14. Though much was done against the Jews by the kings of Persia, God permitting it, much more mischief would have been done if God had not prevented it. He would now more fully show what were God's purposes, of which the prophecies form an outline; and we are concerned to study what is written in these Scriptures of truth, for they belong to our everlasting peace. While Satan and his angels, and evil counsellors, excite princes to mischief against the church, we may rejoice that Christ our Prince, and all his mighty angels, act against our enemies; but we ought not to expect many to favour us in this evil world. Yet the whole counsel of God shall be established; and let each one pray, Lord Jesus, be our righteousness now, and thou wilt be our everlasting confidence, through life, in death, at the day of judgment, and for evermore.</body></html>
