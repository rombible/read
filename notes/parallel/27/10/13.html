If we were without a revelation, we should have thought it congruent that God Himself should direct all events in the world without using any intervening means. But revelation points out that as spiritual beings carry out God's purpose in the natural world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-23.htm" title="For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you.">Exodus 12:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm" title="And when the angel stretched out his hand on Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now your hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing place of Araunah the Jebusite.">2Samuel 24:16</a>) and in the moral world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-10.htm" title="Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repents.">Luke 15:10</a>), so also they do in the political world. From this chapter we not only learn that Israel had a spiritual champion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-21.htm" title="But I will show you that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holds with me in these things, but Michael your prince.">Daniel 10:21</a>) to protect her in her national life, and to watch over her interests, but also that the powers opposed to Israel had their princes, or saviours, which were antagonists of those which watched over Israel. The "princes" of the heathen powers are devils, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-20.htm" title="But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that you should have fellowship with devils.">1Corinthians 10:20</a>. The doctrine of the ministry of angels is taught in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-7.htm" title="The angel of the LORD encamps round about them that fear him, and delivers them.">Psalm 34:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-11.htm" title="For he shall give his angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways.">Psalm 91:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-5.htm" title="For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.">Psalm 96:5</a> (LXX.); <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-21.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth.">Isaiah 24:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-2.htm" title="They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.">Isaiah 46:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-25.htm" title="The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, said; Behold, I will punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him:">Jeremiah 46:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-3.htm" title="Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, you daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together.">Jeremiah 49:3</a>. Further passages in the New Testament bearing upon the question are <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-5.htm" title="For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)">1Corinthians 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Withstood me.--</span>The phrase is identical with <span class= "ital">"</span>stood over against him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-13.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are you for us, or for our adversaries?">Joshua 5:13</a>). The verse implies that the spiritual powers attached to Persia were influencing Cyrus in a manner that was prejudicial to the interests of God's people. It must be borne in mind that the vision occurred at the time of the Samaritan intrigues with the Persian Court in opposition to Zerubbabel.<p><span class= "bld">Michael.--</span>Mentioned only in the Book of Daniel and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-9.htm" title="Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke you.">Jude 1:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-7.htm" title="And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,">Revelation 12:7</a>. The title "chief princes," rightly explained in the margin, shows that the charge of Israel had been entrusted by God to the highest of the heavenly powers; but the name "first prince" points out that, great though he is, he is inconsiderable when compared with God.<p><span class= "bld">I remained there.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">I prevailed there,</span> as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-4.htm" title="Unstable as water, you shall not excel; because you went up to your father's bed; then defiled you it: he went up to my couch.">Genesis 49:4</a>. The person is explaining to Daniel how it had happened that he had received no visible answer to a prayer that had been offered with success three weeks previously. There had been a conflict between the powers of light and darkness, in which the former had gained the victory, which had been decisive. By the kings of Persia are meant all the successors of Cyrus. It may be remarked that from this time onward the Persian kings were, upon the whole, favourable to the interests of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; but, lo, Michael, one of the ohief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia</span>. The rendering of the LXX. is, "And the general (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>) of the King of the Persians withstood me one and twenty days, and behold Michael, one of the first princes, came to help me, and I left him there with the general of the King of the Persians." The sense of Theedotion is nearly the same as the LXX., only he has <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>. Like the LXX., Thee-dotion declares that Michael was left with the Prince of Persia. The Peshitta agrees more with the Massoretic, but, like the LXX. and Theedotion, it is with the "Prince" of Persia that there is some one remaining. The Peshitta here, in opposition to the Greek versions, has the statement that Gabriel remained, not Michael. The Vulgate agrees still further with the Massoretic, only instead of the plural "kings," it has "king." The most important differences are in the last clause, where the LXX. and Theodotion must have had the hiphil of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;</span> where the Massoretic has the niphal. Gratz adopts this reading, which certainly has the advantage of making sense of an otherwise unintelligible passage. Professor Bevan, in his easy way, suggests this to be probably a mere guess, the insertion of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, and the substitution of a transitive for an intransitive verb are quite in the manner of the LXX. translators. He forgets that Theodotion also has this variation, and also that, without any justification from the versions, he himself has suggested various readings. He does not observe that this interpretation affords a reason for Gabriel's presence with Daniel. Michael relieved him in his opposition to the Prince of Persia. The other variant, "prince" instead of "king," has the support of all the versions. <span class="accented">But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days.</span> That is to say, during the whole of Daniel's fast. The angelology of later Judaism is a very complicated, not to say confused, subject. The angelology of one age is not that of another; and the angelology of the Jews in one country is not that of the Jews in another. The Jews themselves understood that the Babylonian captivity did a great deal to develop the doctrine of the angels; the Jewish tradition was that they brought back from Babylon the names of the angels. Not only had their residence in Babylon defined the Jewish ideas as to the names f the angels, they began to have clearer ideas of their functions. They reached the idea that every race had its guardian angel. This view is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>, according to the Septuagint, "He set bounds for the nations according to the number of the angels of God." To a similar purport is Ecclus. 17:17, "To each of the nations he appointed a leader, and Israel is the portion of the Lord." There seems, however, a preparation for this in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-21.htm">Isaiah 24:21</a> (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-9.htm">Psalm 106:9</a>). As independent of revelation there is a strong inherent probability that there are races of beings of intelligence and might vastly superior to man, there is nothing inherently improbable in these intelligences being employed by the Almighty in furthering his providential scheme. Men are instruments of God; is it not at least not improbable that, if there are angels, they, too, co-operate with God in the working out of his great purpose? That every nation should have an angelic prince over it is not more extraordinary than that every Church should have a special angel over it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-2.htm">Revelation 2:2</a>, etc.). That there should be conflicts between these angelic princes is simply to say they are finite. Hitzig's reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a> is not to the point, for there is no indication of warlike opposition here. By the indications here, we might judge that the opposition of the Prince of Persia was to the coming of Gabriel to reveal to Daniel the purpose of God. We know nothing of the means employed in the opposition, or of the reason of it. Keil and Kliefoth have the idea that Gabriel was striving to influence the King of Persia, but was hindered in his efforts by the "Prince of Persia;" this is scarcely berne out by the context. <span class="accented">But</span>, <span class="accented">lo</span>, <span class="accented">Michael</span>, <span class="accented">one of the chief princes</span>, <span class="accented">came to help</span> me. Michael ("Who is like God?") is, in the twenty-first verse, declared to be the "prince" of the Jewish people, therefore equivalent to "the captain of the host of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a>). He is referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a>. Where he is called one of "the chief princes," there is reference to an angelic hierarchy, whether the same as that we find developed in the Book of Enoch or not cannot be decided certainly. In the Book of Tobit 12:15 Raphael declares himself "one of the seven holy angels who present the prayers of the saints, and who go in and out before the glory of the Holy One." The Book of Tobit seems to have been written about <span class="date">B.C. 400</span>; hence this is an indication of opinion before the Books of Enoch. In the Enoch books not only are the great angels mentioned, but their names arc given, and functions are assigned to them; but they are numbered as four, not seven. Enoch is posterior to Tobit, and finds a place for Michael, Raphael, and Gabriel. We have no means of testing whether the number of the chief angelic princes, of whom Michael was one, was four or seven, according to the opinion of Daniel. From the fact that Enoch is, so to speak, in the direct line of apocalyptic descent from Daniel, and Tobit is not, and, moreover, as the angelology of Tobit is in close connection with the Persian hierarchy of <span class="accented">am-haspentas</span>, of which there were seven, - we may regard four as the more genuinely Jewish number. The later Jewish angel-elegy has many Persian elements, as shown by Dr. Kohut, in his 'Angelologie und Demonologie.' Whether the number of the archangels be made four or seven, both Gabriel and Michael are of the number, whereas Gabriel's words would rather indicate that, though Michael belonged to the rank of chief prince, he did not. As we cannot tell the nature of the opposition, we cannot tell the nature of the help afforded. <span class="accented">And I remained there with the kings of Persia.</span> It is very difficult to interpret this if we retain the Massoretic reading. In the first place, the sense given to <span class="accented">nothartee</span> in the Authorized and Revised is unsuitable. The angel is explaining how, after having delayed three whole weeks, he has now come. The sentence, as interpreted above,would have explained why he could not come at all to Daniel. It is attempted to get over this by explaining that Gabriel had beaten off the "Prince" of Persia, and that Michael remained with the King of Persia instead of him. This view, however, contradicts the function assigned to angels of nations, and implies a quasi-omnipresence on the part of Gabriel, and would render his explanation no explanation. The explanation of Gesenius, Havernick, and yon Lengerke, that <span class="accented">nothartee</span> is to be taken as meaning "I received the pre-eminence," as Wirier, "superior discessi apud reges Persarum," has no justification in usage. Gescnius would bring in the Syriac use of the hithpael of this verb, but though both Castell and Brockehuann assign meanings suitable, none of their quotations represents a sense precisely similar to that assigned to the verb here Hitzig's interpretation, "I was delayed," fails to explain his coming. Ewald's explanation, "I was superfluous," is logical, but has no grammatical justification. Professor Bevan's explanation, which would take this last clause as parenthetical, is untenable, as it supplies no redden for the presence of Gabriel with Daniel. We must follow the LXX. and Theodotion in reading, either as Meinhold and Behrmann, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> or better, as Gratz, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b9;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, as the <span class="accented">vav </span>in the former ease would naturally be read conversively. Besides, Gratz's reading explains the needlessly emphatic <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. Further, it seems needful to accept the reading of the two Greek versions and the Peshitta, and instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d3;</span>. None of the old versions support the Massoretic; the Vulgate is the nearest; and all of them have either read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span> or regarded <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5db;&#x5d9;</span> as a form of the construct state, and so vocalized differently. Further, the later context here implies the contiuance of the conflict or controversy (vers. 20, 21). We must understand, then, that Gabriel left Michael to maintain the conflict against the angelic "Prince" of Persia, while he came in obedience to Daniel's prayer. We can have but little idea of what is meant by this conflict in the heavenlies between angelic beings. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:10-21 Whenever we enter into communion with God, it becomes us to have a due sense of the infinite distance between us and the holy God. How shall we, that are dust and ashes, speak to the Lord of glory? Nothing is more likely, nothing more effectual to revive the drooping spirits of the saints, than to be assured of God's love to them. From the very first day we begin to look toward God in a way of duty, he is ready to meet us in the way of mercy. Thus ready is God to hear prayer. When the angel had told the prophet of the things to come, he was to return, and oppose the decrees of the Persian kings against the Jews. The angels are employed as God's ministering servants, Heb 1:14. Though much was done against the Jews by the kings of Persia, God permitting it, much more mischief would have been done if God had not prevented it. He would now more fully show what were God's purposes, of which the prophecies form an outline; and we are concerned to study what is written in these Scriptures of truth, for they belong to our everlasting peace. While Satan and his angels, and evil counsellors, excite princes to mischief against the church, we may rejoice that Christ our Prince, and all his mighty angels, act against our enemies; but we ought not to expect many to favour us in this evil world. Yet the whole counsel of God shall be established; and let each one pray, Lord Jesus, be our righteousness now, and thou wilt be our everlasting confidence, through life, in death, at the day of judgment, and for evermore.</body></html>
