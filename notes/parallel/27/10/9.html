The Septuagint translator seems to have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">nephalti</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">nir'dam</span>). Theodotion is somewhat nearer the Massoretic text, but renders <span class="accented">nirdam</span> by "stupefied." The Pesifitta is an accurate rendering of the text behind the Septuagint. Jerome agrees with Theodotion, rendering <span class="accented">nirdam</span> by <span class="accented">consternatus</span>; he strengthens the phrase, "my face toward the ground," by inserting <span class="accented">haerebat.</span> It would seem that <span class="accented">nirdam</span> is of doubtful authenticity. It may be said this was omitted because of the difficulty of imagining the prophet seeing while in a deep sleep. But a state of sleep does not preclude the possibility of seeing a vision. In the parallel passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>) the LXX. has no difficulty in translating, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>. By assuming the reading of the LXX. and the Peshitta to be correct, we make the process of events more natural; according to the Massoretic reading, though we have an account of his sense of weakness, we have no record that he <span class="accented">fell</span> to the ground, and yet we are told that he was "in a deep sleep, with his face toward the ground" The resemblance is very great to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-12.htm">Job 4:12</a>, "A thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof in thoughts from the vision of the night, when sleep falleth on men (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">tardaymah</span>)." If there has been imitation, the originality and beauty of the passage in Job render it certain that it is the original. It seems more likely to be a change introduced to bring the revelation to Daniel in line with other prophetic revelations. The attitude Daniel assumed was one which implied the deepest abasement - the envoy of the great king kisses the ground at the feet of the envoy of the King of kings. Even the revelation given while sleep had fallen on the subject of the revelation, seems paralleled with what took place at the Transfiguration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-32.htm">Luke 9:32</a>, "And Peter and those that were with him were heavy with sleep," yet it was when they were awaked that they saw the glory). So with Gethsemane. The Hebrew word is the same as that used when Eve was taken out of the side of Adam; he then was asleep - a deepsleep had fallen on him, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">tardaymah</span>)." (For further illustrations, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-23.htm">Ezekiel 3:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-1.htm">Zechariah 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-9. This chapter relates the beginning of Daniel's last vision, which is continued to the end of the book. The time would be long before all would be accomplished; and much of it is not yet fulfilled. Christ appeared to Daniel in a glorious form, and it should engage us to think highly and honourably of him. Let us admire his condescension for us and our salvation. There remained no strength in Daniel. The greatest and best of men cannot bear the full discoveries of the Divine glory; for no man can see it, and live; but glorified saints see Christ as he is, and can bear the sight. How dreadful soever Christ may appear to those under convictions of sin, there is enough in his word to quiet their spirits.</body></html>
