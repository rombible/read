Your dream, and the visions of your head on your bed, are these;">Daniel 2:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm" title="So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell on my face: but he said to me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.">Daniel 8:17</a>. The time is here more narrowly defined as "those days," that is, the period when the vision of Daniel 11 shall receive its complete fulfilment. The "vision" is identical with "the thing" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-1.htm" title="In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.">Daniel 10:1</a>), or "the vision" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-16.htm" title="And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said to him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned on me, and I have retained no strength.">Daniel 10:16</a>). It must be carefully borne in mind that there is no reference to preceding visions, except so far as the revelation contained in Daniel 11 develops certain details of other visions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many</span> <span class="cmt_word">days.</span> None of the versions call for remark. The Peshitta inserts <span class="accented">lesooph</span>, "at the end," before "days." The Massoretic Hebrew has a peculiarity unsupported by the curlier versions: it has "for <span class="accented">the</span> days." Of course, these versions may simply have neglected the article, as have our English versions, Authorized and Revised. <span class="accented">In the latter drays.</span> Kranichfeld holds that this refers to the tatter portion of the vision in ch. 8, not at the end of time. <span class="accented">For yet the vision is for many days.</span> Professor Bevan would translate, "since there is yet a vision for the days," <span class="accented">i.e. </span> for the days already referred to in the eighth chapter. This would make both clauses have practically the same meaning, which this logical connection implies. There seems no need to take the "end of days," as the end of the world. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:10-21 Whenever we enter into communion with God, it becomes us to have a due sense of the infinite distance between us and the holy God. How shall we, that are dust and ashes, speak to the Lord of glory? Nothing is more likely, nothing more effectual to revive the drooping spirits of the saints, than to be assured of God's love to them. From the very first day we begin to look toward God in a way of duty, he is ready to meet us in the way of mercy. Thus ready is God to hear prayer. When the angel had told the prophet of the things to come, he was to return, and oppose the decrees of the Persian kings against the Jews. The angels are employed as God's ministering servants, Heb 1:14. Though much was done against the Jews by the kings of Persia, God permitting it, much more mischief would have been done if God had not prevented it. He would now more fully show what were God's purposes, of which the prophecies form an outline; and we are concerned to study what is written in these Scriptures of truth, for they belong to our everlasting peace. While Satan and his angels, and evil counsellors, excite princes to mischief against the church, we may rejoice that Christ our Prince, and all his mighty angels, act against our enemies; but we ought not to expect many to favour us in this evil world. Yet the whole counsel of God shall be established; and let each one pray, Lord Jesus, be our righteousness now, and thou wilt be our everlasting confidence, through life, in death, at the day of judgment, and for evermore.</body></html>
