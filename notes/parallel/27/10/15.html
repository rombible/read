(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/9-3.htm" title="And I set my face to the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:">Daniel 9:3-4</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.</span> The versions agree with the above. <span class="accented">I set my face toward the ground</span> does not mean that Daniel again fell prostrate, but that his eyes naturally sought the ground. <span class="accented">And I became dumb.</span> Not to be regarded as equivalent to "I remained silent," though there is nothing in the narrative to indicate that Daniel had been speaking; he may have had the sensation of paralyzed vocal cords. Certainly the verb '<span class="accented">alam</span> means "to be dumb," although, as with ourselves, this phrase dots not mean always physiological dumbness, but simply a silence which, from <span class="accented">shyness</span> or fear, one is unable to break. This is the meaning the versions attach to it. The opinion we indicate finds support in the dumbness of Zacharias, the father of John Baptist, after Gabriel appeared to him, and, still more, in what is related in the following verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:10-21 Whenever we enter into communion with God, it becomes us to have a due sense of the infinite distance between us and the holy God. How shall we, that are dust and ashes, speak to the Lord of glory? Nothing is more likely, nothing more effectual to revive the drooping spirits of the saints, than to be assured of God's love to them. From the very first day we begin to look toward God in a way of duty, he is ready to meet us in the way of mercy. Thus ready is God to hear prayer. When the angel had told the prophet of the things to come, he was to return, and oppose the decrees of the Persian kings against the Jews. The angels are employed as God's ministering servants, Heb 1:14. Though much was done against the Jews by the kings of Persia, God permitting it, much more mischief would have been done if God had not prevented it. He would now more fully show what were God's purposes, of which the prophecies form an outline; and we are concerned to study what is written in these Scriptures of truth, for they belong to our everlasting peace. While Satan and his angels, and evil counsellors, excite princes to mischief against the church, we may rejoice that Christ our Prince, and all his mighty angels, act against our enemies; but we ought not to expect many to favour us in this evil world. Yet the whole counsel of God shall be established; and let each one pray, Lord Jesus, be our righteousness now, and thou wilt be our everlasting confidence, through life, in death, at the day of judgment, and for evermore.</body></html>
