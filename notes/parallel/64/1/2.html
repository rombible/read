But the better a man's health, the more thoroughly he can do the work of God. Sickness may be allowed to chasten the erring or rebellious heart, but a Christian whose faith is firm and character established, can ill afford to despise the inestimable blessing of a sound body. Functional and organic disorder or enervation proportionately lessen the capacity for thought, resolution, and activity.<p><span class= "bld">Even as thy soul prospereth.</span>--The word "prospereth" is literally <span class= "ital">makes good way, </span>and so links on to the idea of walking, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/3_john/1-3.htm" title="For I rejoiced greatly, when the brothers came and testified of the truth that is in you, even as you walk in the truth.">3John 1:3-4</a>. The health of the soul came first in the Apostle's mind: when there is that, he can wish for bodily health to support it.<p>(2 <span class= "ital">b.</span>) (3) <span class= "bld">I rejoiced greatly.</span>--Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-4.htm" title="I rejoiced greatly that I found of your children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.">2John 1:4</a>. "For" introduces the reason of the high praise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-2.htm" title="Beloved, I wish above all things that you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.">3John 1:2</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The truth that is in thee.</span>--The inward presence of Christ, manifested by the Christian life and consistency of Caius.<p><span class= "bld">Even as thou walkest in the truth.</span>--This is an additional evidence from the brethren to show that the presence of the truth in Caius had been practically tested.<p><span class= "bld">Thou</span> is emphatic in the Greek, showing that there were others, like Diotrephes, of whom this could not be said.<p>(4) <span class= "bld">I have no greater joy.</span>--This is a general statement arising out of the particular instance. The comparative is double--a comparative formed on a comparative; it may be only irregular, an evidence that the writer was not a classical Greek scholar, or it may be for intensity. There is a similar comparative in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm" title="To me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;">Ephesians 3:8</a>, where the force is evidently intensive.<p><span class= "bld">My children</span> means the members of the churches specially under the care of St. John.<p>(5) <span class= "bld">Thou doest faithfully</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, worthily of a faithful man, consistently with the Christian character. It may be translated, "Thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever. . . ."<p><span class= "bld">Whatsoever thou doest.</span>--Done from right motives, as unto Christ. Whatever form (it is hinted that the form would be various) the activity of Caius might take, so high was the Apostle's opinion of his character, that he was sure it would be done wisely and well.<p><span class= "bld">And to strangers.</span>--According to another reading it is, "And that, strangers," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-6.htm" title="But brother goes to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.">1Corinthians 6:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-8.htm" title="For by grace are you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:">Ephesians 2:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-28.htm" title="And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.">Philippians 1:28</a>. Either way, the strangers would be Christians; but, according to the reading in the text, the brethren would be more or less acquaintances of their host. The duty of entertaining Christians on their travels was of peculiar importance in early times, (1) from the length of time which travelling required, (2) from the poverty of the Christians, (3) from the kind of society they would meet at public inns. The duty is enforced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-13.htm" title="Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.">Romans 12:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm" title="A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach;">1Timothy 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-8.htm" title="But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;">Titus 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-2.htm" title="Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.">Hebrews 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-9.htm" title="Use hospitality one to another without grudging.">1Peter 4:9</a>.<p>(6) Charity might be translated "love."<p><span class= "bld">Before the church.</span>--That where the Apostle then was, and from which they had probably been sent forth as missionaries, or, at any rate, with some definite religious object.<p><span class= "bld">Whom if thou bring forward.</span>--Perhaps while they were still staying with Caius, the emissaries sent back a report to the church whence they came. St. John seems to imply that there was still something which Caius could do for them. "If thou bring forward" is in the Greek in the past; "when thou hast sent them on, it will be a good work."<p><span class= "bld">After a godly sort.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">worthily of God.</span> (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-13.htm" title="Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting to them.">Titus 3:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-11.htm" title="Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come to me: for I look for him with the brothers.">1Corinthians 16:11</a>.) It would imply journey money, provisions, love, care, encouragement, prayer, a humble and reasonable imitation of God's providence to Caius, proportional to his means, the occasion, and the recipients.<p>(7) <span class= "bld">Because that for his name's sake they went forth.</span>--Their object was the highest possible--the glory of God's name. Hence there must have been some kind of missionary character in their journey. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-41.htm" title="And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.">Acts 5:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-40.htm" title="And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brothers to the grace of God.">Acts 15:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-6.htm" title="Among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ:">Romans 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-7.htm" title="Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which you are called?">James 2:7</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Of the Gentiles.</span>--Probably the heathens among whom they were preaching. From settled churches, or wealthy Christians of long standing, there would be nothing inimical to the interests of the message in receiving material support. Among those who were hearing for the first time, it would be highly prejudicial if there were any appearance of selling the truth. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-18.htm" title="What is my reward then?

The principle of co-operation was one of the earliest and leading ideas of the kingdom of Christ. Those who try to work alone lose the mighty force of sympathy, are sure to make mistakes, cannot help arousing opposition, and run the risk of nursing in their own souls an unsuspected spirit of self-will, self-confidence, and spiritual pride. Those who do not care to help the good works of others are at best cold Christians, feeble believers; they fail in the great critical testing virtue of Christian love; they limit the operation of God, who has chosen to work by human means; they hinder the spread of the gospel, and delay the second coming of Christ. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-23.htm" title="Whether any do inquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellow helper concerning you: or our brothers be inquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.">2Corinthians 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-27.htm" title="Only let your conversation be as it becomes the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;">Philippians 1:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-11.htm" title=" And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision.

(2 <span class= "ital">d.</span>)<p>(9) <span class= "bld">I wrote unto the church.</span>--"I wrote somewhat unto the Church." This may either have been a copy of his Gospel or his First Epistle, or a lost letter of no special importance. The Church was that of the place where Caius and Diotrephes lived. Nothing whatever can be said of Diotrephes, except that his personal ambition led him into the grievous sin of rejecting the authority of the bosom friend of the Saviour; that he talked malignantly against St. John and his friends; that he refused to entertain the emissaries of the Church in which St. John was residing; and that he actually went so far as to eject from the local congregation those who were willing to entertain them. We may conjecture that, on account of the loyalty of Caius to St. John, there was so little intercourse between him and Diotrephes, that he would not even hear that St. John had written; that the greater part of the people of the place adhered for the present to Diotrephes, so that in addressing Caius St. John calls them "the church," and "them;" and, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-11.htm" title="Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that does good is of God: but he that does evil has not seen God.">3John 1:11</a>, that even now St. John did not think it superfluous to urge Caius not to follow the example of Diotrephes or submit to his influence.<p><span class= "bld">Loveth to have the preeminence.</span>--Makes it his evil aim to have the whole influence of the community in his own hands.<p>(10) <span class= "bld">If I come.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.">1John 2:28</a>. St. John was evidently expecting in both Letters to set out on the same journey.<p><span class= "bld">Prating.</span>--Idle slander; the moths that are always attracted to "the fierce light that beats about a throne." The intense spiritual affectionateness of the Apostle of love might be easily misunderstood by an unconverted pretender; but it is needless to imagine the groundless babble of a tyrannical upstart.<p><span class= "bld">Casteth them out.</span>--Not necessarily formal excommunication; but Diotrephes had so far succeeded in his object that he was able to exclude these better disposed persons from the Christian society of the place.<p>(2 e.) (11) <span class= "bld">Follow not that which is evil.</span>--One of those simple exhortations so characteristic of St. John, which derive an intense meaning from the circumstances and the context. There was probably every reason why Caius should follow Diotrephes: peace, good-fellowship, the dislike of singularity, popular example, and the indolent indifference which ordinary men feel for truth and right. But the difference between right and wrong is eternal and irreconcilable. The conduct of Diotrephes was of the devil; and mighty moral consequences might follow if Caius gave way from good-natured pliability.

Soul prosperity is the greatest blessing on this side heaven. Grace and health are rich companions. Grace will employ health. A rich soul may be lodged in a weak body; and grace must then be exercised in submitting to such a dispensation. But we may wish and pray that those who have prosperous souls, may have healthful bodies; that their grace may shine where there is still more room for activity. How many professors there are, about whom the apostle's words must be reversed, and we must earnestly wish and pray that their souls might prosper, as their health and circumstances do! True faith will work by love. A good report is due from those who receive good; they could not but testify to the church, what they found and felt. Good men will rejoice in the soul prosperity of others; and they are glad to hear of the grace and goodness of others. And as it is a joy to good parents, it will be a joy to good ministers, to see their people adorn their profession. Gaius overlooked petty differences among serious Christians, and freely helped all who bore the image, and did the work of Christ. He was upright in what he did, as a faithful servant. Faithful souls can hear their own praises without being puffed up; the commendation of what is good in them, lays them at the foot of the cross of Christ. Christians should consider not only what they must do, but what they may do; and should do even the common actions of life, and of good-will, after a godly sort, serving God therein, and designing his glory. Those who freely make known Christ's gospel, should be helped by others to whom God gives the means. Those who cannot themselves proclaim it, may yet receive, help, and countenance those who do so.</body></html>
