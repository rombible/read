He has remonstrated with Diotrephes privately; he has sent messengers to him to speak in his name, and Diotrephes has declined to receive them. There remains one step more, and St. John means to take it. "If he refuse to hear them, tell <span class="accented">it unto the Church:</span> and if he refuse to hear the Church also, let him be unto thee as the Gentile [<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, as in verse 7] and the publican" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-17.htm">Matthew 18:17</a>). Just as the missionary brethren bore witness before the Church to the Christian love of Gains, so the elder will bear witness before the Church to the arrogant hostility of Diotrephes. Once more we see that <span class="accented">words</span> may be <span class="accented">works.</span> He who sanctions teachers of false doctrine shares in their "evil <span class="accented">works"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-11.htm">2 John 1:11</a>); and the "works" of Diotrephes partly consist in "prating against us with evil words." The same word for "evil" is used in both cases <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> - the word used to express "the evil one;" the coincidence is significant. The insolent opposition to the apostle on the part of Diotrephes, and the severe language used by St. John in condemning him, stand almost alone in the New Testament. For a parallel to the latter we must look to our Lord's denunciation of the arrogant and hypocritical Pharisees who opposed him. The Pharisees, like Diotrephes, not merely refused to walk in the right path themselves, but hindered those who were entering upon it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-52.htm">Luke 11:52</a>). They also "cast out" those who presumed to take a less narrow view than themselves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-34.htm">John 9:34, 35</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/3_john/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-12 Both the heart and mouth must be watched. The temper and spirit of Diotrephes was full of pride and ambition. It is bad not to do good ourselves; but it is worse to hinder those who would do good. Those cautions and counsels are most likely to be accepted, which are seasoned with love. Follow that which is good, for he that doeth good, as delighting therein, is born of God. Evil-workers vainly pretend or boast acquaintance with God. Let us not follow that which is proud, selfish, and of bad design, though the example may be given by persons of rank and power; but let us be followers of God, and walk in love, after the example of our Lord.</body></html>
