All that we can safely infer from what is stated is that he is a person of whom Gaius has not hitherto known much; otherwise this elaborate commendation would scarcely be necessary. Conjectures about him are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that he was the bearer of this Epistle to Gaius, - which is not improbable; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that he was a member of the same Church as Diotrephes, and had done good service in opposing him, - which is possible; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that he is the silversmith of Artemis (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-24.htm">Acts 19:24</a>), now "preaching the faith of which he once made havoc," - which is not probable. The name was a common one. It is not easy to determine the meaning of the statement that Demetrius hath the witness of all men, and of the truth itself. Perhaps it means that those who bore testimony to Demetrius were something more than a large body of unanimous human witnesses, strong as such testimony would be; in giving their witness they were guided by "the Spirit of truth." Or it may mean that the facts speak of themselves: as soon as Gaius knows Demetrius he will see that the universal commendation of him is amply justified. The true reading in what follows is, "and <span class="accented">thou</span> knowest that our witness is true" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-35.htm">John 19:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-24.htm">John 21:24</a>). The calm confidence with which the writer asserts his authority, both over Diotrephes and also as a witness, confirms us in the belief that "the elder" is no less than the apostle. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/3_john/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-12 Both the heart and mouth must be watched. The temper and spirit of Diotrephes was full of pride and ambition. It is bad not to do good ourselves; but it is worse to hinder those who would do good. Those cautions and counsels are most likely to be accepted, which are seasoned with love. Follow that which is good, for he that doeth good, as delighting therein, is born of God. Evil-workers vainly pretend or boast acquaintance with God. Let us not follow that which is proud, selfish, and of bad design, though the example may be given by persons of rank and power; but let us be followers of God, and walk in love, after the example of our Lord.</body></html>
