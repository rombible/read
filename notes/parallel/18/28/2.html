Iron was found in the hills of Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-9.htm">Deuteronomy 8:9</a>), in the trans-Jordanic region (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud,' 4:8. &sect; 2), in the sandstone of the Lebanon ('Hist. of Phoenicia,' p. 47), and in Egypt ('Hist. of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 93), probably also in many other places. It is scarcely ever found except in the shape of iron ore, and so has to be "taken out of the earth." And brass is molten out of the stone. By "brass" we must understand copper, since the amalgam brass is never found in a natural state. Copper was yielded abundantly in very early times by the mines which the Egyptians worked in the Sinaitic peninsula ('Hist. of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. pp. 93, 94). It was also obtainable from Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-9.htm">Deuteronomy 8:9</a>), Cyprus ('Hist. of Phoenicia,' p. 311), and Armenia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-13.htm">Ezekiel 27:13</a>). Sometimes it is found pure, but generally in the shape of copper ore, which has to be "molten" for the pure metal to run off. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-11 Job maintained that the dispensations of Providence were regulated by the highest wisdom. To confirm this, he showed of what a great deal of knowledge and wealth men may make themselves masters. The caverns of the earth may be discovered, but not the counsels of Heaven. Go to the miners, thou sluggard in religion, consider their ways, and be wise. Let their courage and diligence in seeking the wealth that perishes, shame us out of slothfulness and faint-heartedness in labouring for the true riches. How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! How much easier, and safer! Yet gold is sought for, but grace neglected. Will the hopes of precious things out of the earth, so men call them, though really they are paltry and perishing, be such a spur to industry, and shall not the certain prospect of truly precious things in heaven be much more so?</body></html>
