The locality of Ophir has been much contested, but, on the whole, the weight of evidence would seem to be in favour of Arabia, on the south-east coast (see the article on "Ophir" in Smith's 'Dict. of the Bible,' which exhausts all that can be said on the subject). The high estimation in which "gold of Ophir" was held appears not only in this passage, but also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-24.htm">Job 22:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>: and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-12.htm">Isaiah 13:12</a>. It is to be accounted for by the imperfection of all the anciently known processes of refining, which left the best refined gold inferior to the natural product of the Ophir mines or washings. <span class="cmt_word">With the precious onyx, or the sapphire</span>. (On the latter of these two stones, see the comment upon ver. 6.) The "onyx" is probably the stone now known as the "sardonyx," which was highly prized by the ancients. It had a place in the breastplate of the high priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-20.htm">Exodus 28:20</a>), and is mentioned among the treasures of the King of Tyre (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>). The sardonyx presents layers variously coloured, as blue, black, white, and vermilion. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:12-19 Job here speaks of wisdom and understanding, the knowing and enjoying of God and ourselves. Its worth is infinitely more than all the riches in this world. It is a gift of the Holy Ghost which cannot be bought with money. Let that which is most precious in God's account, be so in ours. Job asks after it as one that truly desired to find it, and despaired of finding it any where but in God; any way but by Divine revelation.</body></html>
