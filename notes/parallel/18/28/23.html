It is to be observed that while the foundation of wisdom is said to be coeval with that of the world, the very existence of wisdom in relation to man implied the existence of evil, because except by departing from evil there could for man be no wisdom, though evil itself may undoubtedly involve and imply the deflection from a previously existing right. <span class= "ital">Wrong, </span>for example, is what is <span class= "ital">wrung </span>aside from the right. The two ideas which Job starts with are man's ignorance of the <span class= "ital">price </span>and the <span class= "ital">place </span>of wisdom. Neither he nor nature knows the place of it: neither all living, nor the deep, nor the sea; and as for its price, though man is prepared to give any high price for the costly stones and jewels of the earth, yet all that he has to give is not to be mentioned in comparison with the value of wisdom. Wisdom, however, is to be purchased by the poor, as we may infer from the language of the prophet Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-1.htm" title="Ho, every one that thirsts, come you to the waters, and he that has no money; come you, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.">Isaiah 55:1</a>), or, at all events, that which ranks with wisdom; and in like manner Christ represented the kingdom of heaven as a pearl of great price, which would demand all that a man had to buy it, and yet he represented the poor as those especially to whom it was preached. It is true that the wisdom of which Job speaks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-28.htm" title="And to man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.">Job 28:28</a>) is in no way connected with the Gospel of the kingdom; but yet, if the words of the wise are indeed given from one Shepherd, it is impossible not to recognise a central thought underlying all such words, if not in the separate minds of the wise at heart, in the original mind of the one Shepherd. So we can see that that which is true of wisdom as described by Job receives its illustration from that which is true of the Gospel of the kingdom and of the evangelical promises of Isaiah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof</span>. God only understands what true wisdom is. It is a part of his being, an essential element of his nature. He knows "the way" of it, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> how it works and manifests itself; and he knows "the place' of it, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> where it dwells, what limits it has, if any, and how far it is communicable to any beside himself. The highest knowledge is all hid in God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2.htm">Colossians 2-3</a>); and, except so far as God imparts it to him, man can know nothing of it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:20-28 There is a two-fold wisdom; one hid in God, which is secret, and belongs not to us; the other made known by him, and revealed to man. One day's events, and one man's affairs, have such reference to, and so hang one upon another, that He only, to whom all is open, and who sees the whole at one view, can rightly judge of every part. But the knowledge of God's revealed will is within our reach, and will do us good. Let man look upon this as his wisdom, To fear the Lord, and to depart from evil. Let him learn that, and he is learned enough. Where is this wisdom to be found? The treasures of it are hid in Christ, revealed by the word, received by faith, through the Holy Ghost. It will not feed pride or vanity, or amuse our vain curiosity. It teaches and encourages sinners to fear the Lord, and to depart from evil, in the exercise of repentance and faith, without desiring to solve all difficulties about the events of this life.</body></html>
