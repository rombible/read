The word translated "coral" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>) means properly "things that are high." It occurs only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-16.htm">Ezekiel 27:16</a>. The rabbinical interpretation of the word as "coral" is doubtful, since it was unknown to the LXX. Or of pearls. The word <span class="accented">gabish</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>) occurs only in this place. Some identify it with rock-crystal. <span class="cmt_word">For the price of wisdom is above rubies</span>. Here we have another obscure word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), which is variously rendered by "rubies," "pearls," "carbuncles," and "red coral." The balance of authority is in favour of pearls. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:12-19 Job here speaks of wisdom and understanding, the knowing and enjoying of God and ourselves. Its worth is infinitely more than all the riches in this world. It is a gift of the Holy Ghost which cannot be bought with money. Let that which is most precious in God's account, be so in ours. Job asks after it as one that truly desired to find it, and despaired of finding it any where but in God; any way but by Divine revelation.</body></html>
