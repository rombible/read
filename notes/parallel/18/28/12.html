Neither his knowledge nor his wealth can make him master of that; nor can he find it where he discovers so many other secret and precious things.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-28.</span> - Here we come on an abrupt change. From human ingenuity and contrivance Job turns to the consideration of "wisdom" - that wisdom which has been defined as "the reason which deals with principles "(Canon Cook). "Where," he asks, "is this to be found?" It is a wholly different thing from cleverness and ingenuity. It inquires into causes and origins, into the ends and purposes of things; it seeks to solve the riddle of the universe. Perfect wisdom can, of course, only dwell with God (ver. 23). Man must be content with something much below this. With him "the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding" (ver. 28). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But where shall wisdom be found?</span> "Wisdom is the principal thing," says Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>); and again, "It is better to get wisdom than gold" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-16.htm">Proverbs 16:16</a>). But where is it to be found? Job's three friends thought that it dwelt with them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-2.htm">Job 12:2</a>); but this was a mistake, since God reproaches them with their "folly" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-8.htm">Job 42:8</a>). Job does not claim to possess it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-3.htm">Job 26:3</a>); he only desires it. It is his deep conviction that it is only possessed, in the true sense of the word, by God. <span class="cmt_word">And where is the place of understanding?</span> It is not quite clear whether Job intends to make any distinction between "wisdom" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5db;&#x5de;&#x5d4;</span>) and "understanding" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span>). Canon Cook suggests that "wisdom" is "the reason which deals with principles," and "understanding" "the faculty which discerns and appreciates their application." But refined distinctions of this kind are scarcely suitable to the age of Job. Dean Plumptre, in his comment on Proverbs ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 529), accepts the distinction implied in the Septuagint translation of that book, which renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5db;&#x5de;&#x5d4;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>' and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. This is a much simpler and more easily understood distinction, being that which separates between scientific know. ledge and the practical intelligence which directs conduct. But it may be doubted whether Job does not use the two words as synonyms. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:12-19 Job here speaks of wisdom and understanding, the knowing and enjoying of God and ourselves. Its worth is infinitely more than all the riches in this world. It is a gift of the Holy Ghost which cannot be bought with money. Let that which is most precious in God's account, be so in ours. Job asks after it as one that truly desired to find it, and despaired of finding it any where but in God; any way but by Divine revelation.</body></html>
