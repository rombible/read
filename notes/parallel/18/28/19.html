It is generally allowed that the <span class="accented">pithdath</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>) is either the "topaz" or the "chrysolite." In favour of its being the chrysolite is the passage of Pliny which mentions its being esteemed for its <span class="accented">green</span> tints ('Hist. Nat.,' 37:8). Otherwise "topaz" might have appeared to be the best rendering. By "Cush," here translated "Ethiopia," is probably meant Cushite Arabia, or the southern and south-eastern regions (see the author's 'Origin of Nations,' pp. 206-209). Neither shall it be valued with pare gold. Of the four words used for "gold" in this passage (vers. 15-17), one (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5d4;&#x5d1;</span>) seems to be the common name, and to designate the metal by its coleus, "yellow," since <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> means "to be yellow" Another (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>) means properly "what is treasured," or "shut up," from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, "to shut." The third (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;</span>) seems to be the name for "native gold," or that found in river-washings and nuggets, which was regarded as the purest. The fourth (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>) is a poetical name only, and designates gold of extreme purity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/5-11.htm">Song of Solomon 5:11</a>), whether highly refined or native. Job uses them all, to show that there was no gold of any kind wherewith it was possible to purchase wisdom. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:12-19 Job here speaks of wisdom and understanding, the knowing and enjoying of God and ourselves. Its worth is infinitely more than all the riches in this world. It is a gift of the Holy Ghost which cannot be bought with money. Let that which is most precious in God's account, be so in ours. Job asks after it as one that truly desired to find it, and despaired of finding it any where but in God; any way but by Divine revelation.</body></html>
