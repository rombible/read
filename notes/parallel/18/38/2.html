The words, however, are often used proverbially in a general sense.

Job has not been without fault. He has spoken many "words without knowledge" or with insufficient knowledge, and has thus trenched on irreverence, and given the enemies of God occasion to blaspheme. Moreover, he has "darkened counsel." Instead of making the ways of God clear to his friends and companions, he has east doubts upon God's moral government (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7-26</a>), upon his mercy and loving-kindness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-7.htm">Job 16:7-14</a>), almost upon his justice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-7.htm">Job 19:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-1.htm">Job 31:1-35</a>). He is thus open to censure, and receives censure, and owns himself "vile" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-4.htm">Job 40:4</a>), before peace and reconciliation can be established. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/38.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>38:1-3 Job had silenced, but had not convinced his friends. Elihu had silenced Job, but had not brought him to admit his guilt before God. It pleased the Lord to interpose. The Lord, in this discourse, humbles Job, and brings him to repent of his passionate expressions concerning God's providential dealings with him; and this he does, by calling upon Job to compare God's being from everlasting to everlasting, with his own time; God's knowledge of all things, with his own ignorance; and God's almighty power, with his own weakness. Our darkening the counsels of God's wisdom with our folly, is a great provocation to God. Humble faith and sincere obedience see farthest and best into the will of the Lord.</body></html>
