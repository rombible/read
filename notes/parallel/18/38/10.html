The decree itself is given in ver. 11. <span class="cmt_word">And set bars and doors</span> (see above, ver. 8, where the imagery of "doors" has been already introduced). As Professor Lee observes, "The term <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> contains a metaphor taken from the large folding-doors of a city, which are usually set up for the purpose of stepping the progress of an invading enemy, and are hence supplied with bolts and bars" ('Book of Job,' p. 490). Representations of such folding-doors are common in the Assyrian sculptures; and in one instance the doors themselves, or, to speak more exactly, their outer bronze easing, has been recovered (see a paper in the 'Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology,' on the Bronze Gates discovered by Mr. Rassam at Balawat, vol. 7. pp. 85-115). These gates were twenty-two feet high and six feet broad each. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/38.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>38:4-11 For the humbling of Job, God here shows him his ignorance, even concerning the earth and the sea. As we cannot find fault with God's work, so we need not fear concerning it. The works of his providence, as well as the work of creation, never can be broken; and the work of redemption is no less firm, of which Christ himself is both the Foundation and the Corner-stone. The church stands as firm as the earth.</body></html>
