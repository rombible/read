God's might is especially shown in his power to control and confine the sea, which rages so terribly and seems so utterly uncontrollable. God has blocked it in "with doors" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with "bounds that it cannot pass, neither turn again to cover the earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-9.htm">Psalm 145:9</a>). Sometimes the barrier is one of lofty and solid rock, which seems well suited to confine and restrain; but sometimes it is no more than a thin streak of sliver sand or a bank of loose, shifting pebbles. Yet, in both cases alike, the restraint suffices. "The sand is placed for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-22.htm">Jeremiah 5:22</a>); the beach of shifting pebbles remains as firm as the rock itself, and never recedes or advances more than a few feet. <span class="cmt_word">When it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at its birth, when it was first formed, by the gathering together of the waters into one place (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/38.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>38:4-11 For the humbling of Job, God here shows him his ignorance, even concerning the earth and the sea. As we cannot find fault with God's work, so we need not fear concerning it. The works of his providence, as well as the work of creation, never can be broken; and the work of redemption is no less firm, of which Christ himself is both the Foundation and the Corner-stone. The church stands as firm as the earth.</body></html>
