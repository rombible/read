Eliphaz had virtually said the same thing, though the form in which he cast it was the converse of this (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-3.htm" title="Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that you are righteous? or is it gain to him, that you make your ways perfect?">Job 22:3</a>), for he had represented it as a matter of indifference to <span class= "ital">God </span>whether man was righteous or not, which was, of course, to sap the foundations of all morality; for if God cares not whether man is righteous or not, it certainly cannot <span class= "ital">profit </span>man to be righteous. On the other hand, Eliphaz had in form uttered the opposite doctrine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-21.htm" title="Acquaint now yourself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come to you.">Job 22:21</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God</span>. Again it must be remarked that Job had not said this. The nearest approach to it is to be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22</a>, where this passage occurs: "It is all one; therefore I say, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked" (Revised Version). Elsewhere Job speaks, not generally, but of his own individual case, remarking that his righteousness has not saved him from calamity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-17.htm">Job 9:17, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-15.htm">Job 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-9.htm">Job 17:9</a>-17, etc.). And the fact is one that causes him the deepest perplexity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:1-9 Elihu calls upon those present to decide with him upon Job's words. The plainest Christian, whose mind is enlightened, whose heart is sanctified by the Spirit of God, and who is versed in the Scriptures, can say how far matters, words, or actions, agree with true religion, better than any that lean to their own understandings. Job had spoken as if he meant wholly to justify himself. He that say, I have cleansed my hands in vain, does not only offend against God's children, Ps 73:13-15, but gratifies his enemies, and says as they say.</body></html>
