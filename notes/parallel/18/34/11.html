God "rewardeth every man according to his work" (Psalm 62:13), renders to each one good or evil, according as his own deeds have been the one or the other. But this must be understood of the man's <span class="accented">whole</span> conduct, and God's <span class="accented">entire</span> treatment of him. Such an absolute rectitude of God's moral government, considered as a whole, is implied and involved in his absolute and perfect justice. <span class="cmt_word">And cause every man to find according to his ways</span>. We "find according to our ways" when, having "ploughed iniquity, and sown wickedness, we reap the same" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8</a>), or when, on the other hand, having "sown in righteousness, we reap in mercy" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a>). Exact retribution is the law of God's rule; but the exactness cannot be seen, or tested, or demonstrated in this life. It will appear, however, and be recognized by all, at the consummation of all things. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:10-15 Elihu had showed Job, that God meant him no hurt by afflicting him, but intended his spiritual benefit. Here he shows, that God did him no wrong by afflicting him. If the former did not satisfy him, this ought to silence him. God cannot do wickedness, nor the Almighty commit wrong. If services now go unrewarded, and sins now go unpunished, yet there is a day coming, when God will fully render to every man according to his works. Further, though the believer's final condemnation is done away through the Saviour's ransom, yet he has merited worse than any outward afflictions; so that no wrong is done to him, however he may be tried.</body></html>
