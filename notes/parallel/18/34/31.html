(So Rosenmuller and others.) If the passage be thus rendered, Elihu must be considered as, like Eliphaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-8.htm">Job 5:8</a>), Bildad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-5.htm">Job 8:5</a>), and Zophar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-13.htm">Job 11:13-15</a>), counselling Job to submit himself to God, acknowledging his sin, accepting his punishment, and promising amendment for the future (ver. 22). But perhaps it is better to regard the passage as interrogative, and Elihu as asking - What man, among those whom God has cast down and punished, has ever sought to deprecate his wrath by contrition, confession, and promise of amendment, implying that, had they done so, God would have relented and forgiven them? (see the Revised Version). In this case no direct counsel is offered to Job; but still an indirect hint is given him. <span class="cmt_word">I will not offend any more</span>. This is preferable to the marginal rendering of the Revised Version, "though I have not offended." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:31-37 When we reprove for what is amiss, we must direct to what is good. Job's friends would have had him own himself a wicked man. Let will only oblige him to own that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips. Let us, in giving reproof, not make a matter worse than it is. Elihu directs Job to humble himself before God for his sins, and to accept the punishment. Also to pray to God to discover his sins to him. A good man is willing to know the worst of himself; particularly, under affliction, he desires to be told wherefore God contends with him. It is not enough to be sorry for our sins, but we must go and sin no more. And if we are affectionate children, we shall love to speak with our Father, and to tell him all our mind. Elihu reasons with Job concerning his discontent under affliction. We are ready to think every thing that concerns us should be just as we would have it; but it is not reasonable to expect this. Elihu asks whether there was not sin and folly in what Job said. God is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works, Ps 145:17. The believer saith, Let my Saviour, my wise and loving Lord, choose every thing for me. I am sure that will be wisest, and the best for his glory and my good.</body></html>
