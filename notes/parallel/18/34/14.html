We must either regard it as the consequence of the former one--"If He set His heart upon Himself, had regard to His own interest, then He would gather unto Himself His own spirit and His own breath"--or we must do as some do: supply the "if" at the beginning of it, and read it as in the Authorised Version. In this sense, the setting His heart upon man would mean in a bad sense--to do him injury. In doing him injury He would, in fact, injure His own. The effect of His setting His heart on man would be that all flesh would perish together, and man would turn again to his dust; but then God would have injured His own, and not another's, in so doing. It is hardly possible that the writer of this last clause should have been ignorant of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm" title="In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread, till you return to the ground; for out of it were you taken: for dust you are, and to dust shall you return.">Genesis 3:19</a>. The speech of Elihu is marked with entire self-confidence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath</span>. Two renderings are proposed, both supported By about equal authority: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "If he (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God) set his heart upon <span class="accented">himself</span>, if he should gather to himself <span class="accented">his own</span> spirit, and breath," then all flesh would perish, etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "If he [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God] set his heart upon [or, 'against'] <span class="accented">man</span>, if he were to gather to himself man's spirit and man's breath," then, etc. The difference is not great. God could, either by withdrawing from man the breath and spirit which he has given him, or simply by withholding from man the quickening and sustaining influences which he is perpetually putting forth, reduce all humankind to nothingness. Being so completely master of man, he would surely not condescend to treat him with injustice. Injustice implies something of opposition, struggle, rivalry. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:10-15 Elihu had showed Job, that God meant him no hurt by afflicting him, but intended his spiritual benefit. Here he shows, that God did him no wrong by afflicting him. If the former did not satisfy him, this ought to silence him. God cannot do wickedness, nor the Almighty commit wrong. If services now go unrewarded, and sins now go unpunished, yet there is a day coming, when God will fully render to every man according to his works. Further, though the believer's final condemnation is done away through the Saviour's ransom, yet he has merited worse than any outward afflictions; so that no wrong is done to him, however he may be tried.</body></html>
