He can thus never be unjust, since he can have no temptation to be unjust. <span class="cmt_word">Or who hath disposed the whole world?</span> rather, <span class="accented">Who hath laid upon him the whole world?</span> (see the margin of the Revised Version). Elihu repeats the idea of the previous clause in other words. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:10-15 Elihu had showed Job, that God meant him no hurt by afflicting him, but intended his spiritual benefit. Here he shows, that God did him no wrong by afflicting him. If the former did not satisfy him, this ought to silence him. God cannot do wickedness, nor the Almighty commit wrong. If services now go unrewarded, and sins now go unpunished, yet there is a day coming, when God will fully render to every man according to his works. Further, though the believer's final condemnation is done away through the Saviour's ransom, yet he has merited worse than any outward afflictions; so that no wrong is done to him, however he may be tried.</body></html>
