It was not for Elihu, who professed a desire to "justify" (or completely exonerate) Job, to aggravate his guilt by means of rhetorical comment; and the comment itself was unfair, for Job had not indulged in scorn to any extent, much less "drunk it up like water" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-16.htm">Job 15:16</a>). He had in no respect scorned God; and if he had occasionally poured some scorn upon his "comforters" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-21.htm">Job 6:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-2.htm">Job 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-4.htm">Job 13:4-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-2.htm">Job 16:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-2.htm">Job 21:2-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-2.htm">Job 26:2-4</a>), must it not be admitted that they had deserved it? It was the duty of Elihu to act as moderator between Job and the "comforters," whereas he here seeks to exasperate them, and lash them up to fury against their afflicted friend. Perhaps Job's impassive attitude has embittered him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:1-9 Elihu calls upon those present to decide with him upon Job's words. The plainest Christian, whose mind is enlightened, whose heart is sanctified by the Spirit of God, and who is versed in the Scriptures, can say how far matters, words, or actions, agree with true religion, better than any that lean to their own understandings. Job had spoken as if he meant wholly to justify himself. He that say, I have cleansed my hands in vain, does not only offend against God's children, Ps 73:13-15, but gratifies his enemies, and says as they say.</body></html>
