Elihu views the wicked man as almost certainly an oppressor, whose misdeeds "cause the cry of the poor to come before God," and provoke God, the Avenger of the poor and needy, to visit him with chastisement. <span class="cmt_word">And he heareth the cry of the afflicted</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-23.htm">Exodus 22:23, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-5.htm">Psalm 12:5</a>, etc.) God's ears are ever open to the cry of the oppressed, and his hand is ever <span class="accented">heavy</span> upon those who "afflict" the weak and defenceless (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-12.htm">Isaiah 3:12-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-1.htm">Micah 3:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:16-30 Elihu appeals directly to Job himself. Could he suppose that God was like those earthly princes, who hate right, who are unfit to rule, and prove the scourges of mankind? It is daring presumption to condemn God's proceedings, as Job had done by his discontents. Elihu suggests divers considerations to Job, to produce in him high thoughts of God, and so to persuade him to submit. Job had often wished to plead his cause before God. Elihu asks, To what purpose? All is well that God does, and will be found so. What can make those uneasy, whose souls dwell at ease in God? The smiles of all the world cannot quiet those on whom God frowns.</body></html>
