Elihu makes, indeed, a great profession of wisdom, and expressly addresses himself to the wise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-2.htm" title="Hear my words, O you wise men; and give ear to me, you that have knowledge.">Job 34:2</a>), and insists upon the necessity of discrimination (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/34-3.htm" title="For the ear tries words, as the mouth tastes meat.">Job 34:3-4</a>). It is to be observed that Job himself had given utterance to much the same sentiment in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-11.htm" title="Does not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?">Job 12:11</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-37.</span> - In this chapter Elihu turns from Job to those whom he addresses as "wise men" (ver. 2), or "men of understanding" (ver. 10). Whether these are Job's three special friends, or others among the company which had perhaps gathered to hear the debate, is uncertain. He makes the subject of his address to them Job's conduct - scarcely a polite thing to do in Job's presence. Job, he says, has scorned God and charged him with injustice (vers. 5-9). He will vindicate him. This he proceeds to do in vers. 10-30. He then points out what Job's course ought to be (vers. 31-33), and winds up by an appeal to the "men of understanding" to endorse his condemnation of Job as a sinner and a rebel (vers. 34-37). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Furthermore Elihu answered and said, Hear my words, O ye wise men</span>. Having, as he may have thought, reduced Job to silence by the fame of his reasonings, Elihu, wishing to carry with him the general consent of his audience, makes an appeal to them, or, at any rate, to the wise among them, to judge Job's conduct and pronounce upon it. It is probable, as Schultens remarks, that a considerable number of influential persons had by this time collected together to hear the discussion which was going on. To these Elihu specially addresses himself: <span class="cmt_word">Give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:1-9 Elihu calls upon those present to decide with him upon Job's words. The plainest Christian, whose mind is enlightened, whose heart is sanctified by the Spirit of God, and who is versed in the Scriptures, can say how far matters, words, or actions, agree with true religion, better than any that lean to their own understandings. Job had spoken as if he meant wholly to justify himself. He that say, I have cleansed my hands in vain, does not only offend against God's children, Ps 73:13-15, but gratifies his enemies, and says as they say.</body></html>
