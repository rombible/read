The heavens are regarded as spread out over the whole earth, like a curtain or awning over a tent, everywhere overshadowing and promoting it. This "stretching" or "spreading out" is felt to be one of the mightiest and most marvellous of the Creater's works, and is constantly put forward in Scripture as a special evidence of his omnipotence (see, besides the pasages above quoted, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-12.htm">Isaiah 45:12</a>; It. 13; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12</a>). It adds to the marvellousness that God did it all "alone," or "by himself" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And treadeth upon the waves of the sea</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the heights of the sea</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the waves, which run mountains-high. God plants his feet upon these, to crush them in their proud might (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/93-5.htm">Psalm 93:5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-13 In this answer Job declared that he did not doubt the justice of God, when he denied himself to be a hypocrite; for how should man be just with God? Before him he pleaded guilty of sins more than could be counted; and if God should contend with him in judgment, he could not justify one out of a thousand, of all the thoughts, words, and actions of his life; therefore he deserved worse than all his present sufferings. When Job mentions the wisdom and power of God, he forgets his complaints. We are unfit to judge of God's proceedings, because we know not what he does, or what he designs. God acts with power which no creature can resist. Those who think they have strength enough to help others, will not be able to help themselves against it.</body></html>
