Job has already admitted the utterance of "rash words" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-3.htm">Job 6:3</a>), and, at least hypothetically, that he "has sinned" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-20.htm">Job 7:20</a>), and needs "pardon" for his "transgression" (Job 7:24). Job, if he tried to "justify himself," would have to acknowledge such shortcomings, such imperfections, such sins - at any rate, of infirmity - as would make his attempted justification a real self-condemnation. <span class="cmt_word">If I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse</span>; rather, <span class="accented">even were</span> I <span class="accented">perfect</span> <span class="accented">it</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> my mouth) <span class="accented">would prove me perverse</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> supposing I were actually perfect, and tried to prove it, my speech would be so hesitating and confused, that I should only seem to be perverse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:14-21 Job is still righteous in his own eyes, ch. 32:1, and this answer, though it sets forth the power and majesty of God, implies that the question between the afflicted and the Lord of providence, is a question of might, and not of right; and we begin to discover the evil fruits of pride and of a self-righteous spirit. Job begins to manifest a disposition to condemn God, that he may justify himself, for which he is afterwards reproved. Still Job knew so much of himself, that he durst not stand a trial. If we say, We have no sin, we not only deceive ourselves, but we affront God; for we sin in saying so, and give the lie to the Scripture. But Job reflected on God's goodness and justice in saying his affliction was without cause.</body></html>
