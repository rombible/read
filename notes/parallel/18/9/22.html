There is no difference, that is, between the case of the righteous and the wicked; all are alike sinful in God's sight, all equally "concluded under sin" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-22.htm">Galatians 3:22</a>), and all consequently obnoxious to punishment at his hands (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:2</a>). In a certain sense the statement is true, and corresponds with the argument of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1.htm">Romans 1-3</a>; but no account is taken here of God's gracious forgiveness of sin, much less of the general scheme of redemption, or the compensation for earthly sufferings in an eternity of happiness, on which the hope of the Christian rests. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore I said it</span>; rather, <span class="accented">therefore I say</span> with the Revised Version. <span class="cmt_word">He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked</span>. <span class="accented">As</span> <span class="accented">far as this</span> world is concerned, it is undoubtedly true that calamities fall alike upon the just and upon the unjust. Death is the lot of all; trouble, suffering, grief, the lot of all (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-7.htm">Job 6:7</a>). Nor can it even be said that the wicked in this world suffer more than the good (comp. 1 Oct. 1529). Their sufferings are more the natural consequence of their actions, but do not seem to exceed in amount or severity the sufferings of the good. But this only shows that there must be a future life to redress the apparent injustice of the present one, and set the balance right. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:22-24 Job touches briefly upon the main point now in dispute. His friends maintained that those who are righteous and good, always prosper in this world, and that none but the wicked are in misery and distress: he said, on the contrary, that it is a common thing for the wicked to prosper, and the righteous to be greatly afflicted. Yet there is too much passion in what Job here says, for God doth not afflict willingly. When the spirit is heated with dispute or with discontent, we have need to set a watch before our lips.</body></html>
