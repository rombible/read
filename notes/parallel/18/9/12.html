The expression is much stronger than that used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>. Job seems to be smarting under the recollection of all that he has lost, and takes an aggrieved tone. <span class="cmt_word">Who can hinder him?</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-6.htm">Jeremiah 18:6</a>; Romans 19:20). <span class="cmt_word">Who will say unto him, What doest thou?</span> To have to do with such an irresistible Being, alone in his might, would indeed be terrible if, while absolutely powerful, unchecked and uncontrolled from without, he were not also absolutely good, and therefore controlled and checked by a law from within. This, however, Job, in his present mood, does not seem clearly to see. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-13 In this answer Job declared that he did not doubt the justice of God, when he denied himself to be a hypocrite; for how should man be just with God? Before him he pleaded guilty of sins more than could be counted; and if God should contend with him in judgment, he could not justify one out of a thousand, of all the thoughts, words, and actions of his life; therefore he deserved worse than all his present sufferings. When Job mentions the wisdom and power of God, he forgets his complaints. We are unfit to judge of God's proceedings, because we know not what he does, or what he designs. God acts with power which no creature can resist. Those who think they have strength enough to help others, will not be able to help themselves against it.</body></html>
