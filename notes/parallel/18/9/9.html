(<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f1d;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), supported, as it is, by most of the other ancient versions and by the Targums, has caused the <span class="accented">stellar</span> character of these names to be generally recognized; but the exact meaning of each term is, to some extent, still a matter of dispute. On the whole, it seems most probable that '<span class="accented">Ash</span> or '<span class="accented">Aish</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-32.htm">Job 38:32</a>), designates "the Great Bear," called by the Arabs <span class="accented">Nahsh</span> while <span class="accented">Kesil</span> is the name of the constellation of Orion, and <span class="accented">Kimah of</span> that of the Pleiades. The word '<span class="accented">Ash</span> means "a litter," and may be compared with the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> and our own" Charles's Wain," both of them names given to the Great Bear, from a fancied resemblance of its form to that of a vehicle. <span class="accented">Kesil</span> means "an insolent, rich man" (Lee); and is often translated by "fool" in the Book of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-16.htm">Proverbs 14:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-20.htm">Proverbs 15:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-1.htm">Proverbs 19:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-20.htm">Proverbs 21:20</a>, etc. It seems to have been an <span class="accented">epitheton usitatum</span> of Nimrod, who, according to Oriental tradition, made war upon the gods, and was bound in the sky for his impiety - the constellation being thenceforth called "the Giant" (<span class="accented">Gibbor</span>)' or "the insolent one' (Kesil), and later by the Greeks "Orion" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-8.htm">Amos 5:8</a>; and <span class="accented">infra</span>' <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-31.htm">Job 38:31</a>). <span class="accented">Kimah</span> undoubtedly designates "the Pleiades." It occurs again, in connection with <span class="accented">Kesil</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-31.htm">Job 38:31</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-8.htm">Amos 5:8</a> The meaning is probably "a heap," "a cluster" (Lee); which was also the Greek idea: <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> (Eustath., 'Comment. in Hom. II.,' 18:488); and which has been also inimitably expressed by Tennyson in the line, "Like a swarm of dazzling fireflies tangled in a silver braid." <span class="cmt_word">And the chambers of the south</span>. The Chaldeans called the zodiacal constellations "mansions of the sun" and "of the moon" ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. it. p. 575); but these do not seem to be here intended. Rather Job has in his mind those immense spaces of the sky which lie behind his southern horizon; how far extending, he knows not. Though the circumnavigation of Africa was not effected until about r c. 600, yet it is not improbable that he may have derived from travellers or merchants some knowledge of the Southern hemisphere. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-13 In this answer Job declared that he did not doubt the justice of God, when he denied himself to be a hypocrite; for how should man be just with God? Before him he pleaded guilty of sins more than could be counted; and if God should contend with him in judgment, he could not justify one out of a thousand, of all the thoughts, words, and actions of his life; therefore he deserved worse than all his present sufferings. When Job mentions the wisdom and power of God, he forgets his complaints. We are unfit to judge of God's proceedings, because we know not what he does, or what he designs. God acts with power which no creature can resist. Those who think they have strength enough to help others, will not be able to help themselves against it.</body></html>
