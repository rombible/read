An almost exact repetition of the words of Eliphaz in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-9.htm">Job 5:9</a>. The repetition may have been conscious or unconscious. Job may have meant to say, "My view of God embraces all that you can tell me of him, and goes further;" or he may simply have used words concerning the Divine unsearch-ableness which were common in the mouths of religious men in his time (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-18.htm">Psalm 72:18</a>; and infra, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-13 In this answer Job declared that he did not doubt the justice of God, when he denied himself to be a hypocrite; for how should man be just with God? Before him he pleaded guilty of sins more than could be counted; and if God should contend with him in judgment, he could not justify one out of a thousand, of all the thoughts, words, and actions of his life; therefore he deserved worse than all his present sufferings. When Job mentions the wisdom and power of God, he forgets his complaints. We are unfit to judge of God's proceedings, because we know not what he does, or what he designs. God acts with power which no creature can resist. Those who think they have strength enough to help others, will not be able to help themselves against it.</body></html>
