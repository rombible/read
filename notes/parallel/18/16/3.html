Eliphaz had contributed nothing to the discussion in his last reply; he had simply reiterated what had been said before.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall vain words have an end?</span> literally, as in the margin, <span class="accented">words of wind</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> words which pass by a man "as the idle wind which he regards not." Will his friends never bring their futile speaking to a close? <span class="cmt_word">Or what emboldeneth thee that thou anwerest?</span> rather, <span class="accented">what provoketh</span> thee? (Revised Version) Job had begged that his friends would be silent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-5.htm">Job 13:5, 13</a>). He supposes that they would have complied with his wish if he had not provoked them, but professes an inability to see what provocation he had given. His last speech, however, had certainly not been conciliatory (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-1.htm">Job 12:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-4.htm">Job 13:4, 7</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-5 Eliphaz had represented Job's discourses as unprofitable, and nothing to the purpose; Job here gives his the same character. Those who pass censures, must expect to have them retorted; it is easy, it is endless, but what good does it do? Angry answers stir up men's passions, but never convince their judgments, nor set truth in a clear light. What Job says of his friends is true of all creatures, in comparison with God; one time or other we shall be made to see and own that miserable comforters are they all. When under convictions of sin, terrors of conscience, or the arrests of death, only the blessed Spirit can comfort effectually; all others, without him, do it miserably, and to no purpose. Whatever our brethren's sorrows are, we ought by sympathy to make them our own; they may soon be so.</body></html>
