These words mark a transition. Job turns from complaints against his "comforters" to an enumeration of his own sufferings. <span class="cmt_word">He hath made me weary</span>. God has afflicted him with an intolerable sense of weariness. He is tired of life; tired of disputing with his friends; tired even of pouring out his lamentations and complaints and expostulations to God. His one desire is rest. So I have seen in the <span class="accented">piombi</span> of Venice, where political prisoners were tortured by cold and heat, and hunger and thirst, for long weeks or months, and brought to despair, such scratchlags as the following: "Luigi A. implora pace, Giuseppe B. implore eterna quiete." Job has entreated for this boon of rest repeatedly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-13.htm">Job 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-9.htm">Job 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-15.htm">Job 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-18.htm">Job 10:18</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast made desolate all my company</span>. The loss of his children has desolated his household; his other afflictions have alienated his friends. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:6-16 Here is a doleful representation of Job's grievances. What reason we have to bless God, that we are not making such complaints! Even good men, when in great troubles, have much ado not to entertain hard thoughts of God. Eliphaz had represented Job as unhumbled under his affliction: No, says Job, I know better things; the dust is now the fittest place for me. In this he reminds us of Christ, who was a man of sorrows, and pronounced those blessed that mourn, for they shall be comforted.</body></html>
