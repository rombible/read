The "man of sorrows" of the Old Testament is, in many respects, a type of the "Man of sorrows" of the New; and, in the Messianic psalms, David constantly applies to Christ expressions which Job had used in reference to himself (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-13.htm">Psalm 22:13</a>). They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-1.htm">Micah 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-30.htm">Matthew 27:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-64.htm">Luke 22:64</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-22.htm">John 18:22</a>). They have gathered themselves together against me (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-15.htm">Psalm 35:15</a>, and compare, in illustration of the literal and historical sense, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-1.htm">Job 30:1, 10-14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:6-16 Here is a doleful representation of Job's grievances. What reason we have to bless God, that we are not making such complaints! Even good men, when in great troubles, have much ado not to entertain hard thoughts of God. Eliphaz had represented Job as unhumbled under his affliction: No, says Job, I know better things; the dust is now the fittest place for me. In this he reminds us of Christ, who was a man of sorrows, and pronounced those blessed that mourn, for they shall be comforted.</body></html>
