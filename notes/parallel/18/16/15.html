As the second half of the verse must be figurative, there seems to be no reason to understand the first half otherwise.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin</span>. Another transition. Job turns to the consideration of how he has acted under his severe afflictions. In the first place, he has put on sackcloth, not for a time merely, as ordinary mourners do, but for a permanency, so that he may be said to have sewn it to his skin. There is, perhaps, also an allusion to the adhesion of the garment to his many sores. <span class="cmt_word">And have defiled my horn in the dust</span>. "My horn" is equivalent to "my pride," "my dignity." Job, when he left his state, and put on sackcloth, and "sat down among the ashes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-8.htm">Job 2:8</a>), denuded himself of his honour and dignity, and as it were trailed them in the dust <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:6-16 Here is a doleful representation of Job's grievances. What reason we have to bless God, that we are not making such complaints! Even good men, when in great troubles, have much ado not to entertain hard thoughts of God. Eliphaz had represented Job as unhumbled under his affliction: No, says Job, I know better things; the dust is now the fittest place for me. In this he reminds us of Christ, who was a man of sorrows, and pronounced those blessed that mourn, for they shall be comforted.</body></html>
