He has evidently been exceedingly nettled by Job's contemptuous words concerning his "comforters" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-2.htm">Job 16:2, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-10.htm">Job 17:10</a>); and aims at nothing but venting his anger, and terrifying Job by a series of denunciations and threats. Job has become to him "the wicked man" (vers. 5, 21), an embodiment of all that is evil, and one "that knoweth not God." No punishment is too severe for him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, How long will it be ere ye make an end of words?</span> (So Rosenmuller, Gesenius, Welte, Merx, Lee, and Canon Cook.) Others render, "How long will ye <span class="accented">lay snares for</span> words?" which is a possible translation, but does not give a very good sense. Bildad, a tolerably concise speaker himself (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-2.htm">Job 8:2-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/25-2.htm">Job 25:2-6</a>), is impatient at the length of Job's replies. He had already, in his former speech (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-2.htm">Job 8:2</a>), reproached Job with his prolixity; now he repeats the charge. The employment of the second person <span class="accented">plural</span> in this and the following verses is not very easily accounted for. Bildad can scarcely mean to blame his friend Eliphaz. Perhaps he regards Job as having supporters among the lookers-on, of whom there may have been several besides Elihu (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-2.htm">Job 32:2</a>). Mark; rather, <span class="accented">consider</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> think a little, instead of talking. <span class="cmt_word">And afterwards we will speak</span>. Then, calmly and without hurry, we will proceed to reply to what you have said. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-4 Bildad had before given Job good advice and encouragement; here he used nothing but rebukes, and declared his ruin. And he concluded that Job shut out the providence of God from the management of human affairs, because he would not admit himself to be wicked.</body></html>
