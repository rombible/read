He strings together a long series of menaces - probably ancient saws, drawn from "the wisdom of the Beni Kedem" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-30.htm">1 Kings 4:30</a>), and descriptive of the wretched fate of the wicked man, with whom he identifies Job. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out</span>. Whatever the wicked man may at any time have acquired of splendour, glory, honour, wealth, or prosperity, shall be taken from him, and as it were extinguished. <span class="cmt_word">And the spark of his fire shall not shine</span>. Not a single trace of his splendour, not a spark, not a glimmer, shall remain. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:5-10 Bildad describes the miserable condition of a wicked man; in which there is much certain truth, if we consider that a sinful condition is a sad condition, and that sin will be men's ruin, if they do not repent. Though Bildad thought the application of it to Job was easy, yet it was not safe nor just. It is common for angry disputants to rank their opponents among God's enemies, and to draw wrong conclusions from important truths. The destruction of the wicked is foretold. That destruction is represented under the similitude of a beast or bird caught in a snare, or a malefactor taken into custody. Satan, as he was a murderer, so he was a robber, from the beginning. He, the tempter, lays snares for sinners wherever they go. If he makes them sinful like himself, he will make them miserable like himself. Satan hunts for the precious life. In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare for himself, and God is preparing for his destruction. See here how the sinner runs himself into the snare.</body></html>
