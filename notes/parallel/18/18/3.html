In this chapter there is a marked increase in his harshness and violence. It has, however, a certain resemblance to Job 8, inasmuch as Bildad works out a simile here, as he did there; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-16.htm" title="His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.">Job 18:16</a> the two similes touch. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-2.htm" title="How long will it be ere you make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.">Job 18:2</a>, which resembles <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-2.htm" title="How long will you speak these things? and how long shall the words of your mouth be like a strong wind?">Job 8:2</a>, we must supply, as the Authorised Version does, <span class= "ital">Will it be ere? </span>or the negative, <span class= "ital">Will ye not make?</span> &c., or else we must render, "How long [will ye speak thus]? Make an end of words," &c. The plural is used because Job is regarded as the representative of a class, or else as we use the plural instead of the singular in addressing a person.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore are we counted as beasts?</span> The allusion is probably to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-10.htm">Job 16:10</a>, where Job spoke of his "comforters" as "gaping upon him with their mouths." <span class="cmt_word">And reputed vile in your sight!</span> or, <span class="accented">reckoned unclean</span>. Job had spoken of his "miserable comforters" as "ungodly and wicked" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-11.htm">Job 16:11</a>), without wisdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-10.htm">Job 17:10</a>) and without understanding (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-4.htm">Job 17:4</a>). But he had not said that they were "unclean." Bildad, therefore, misrepresents him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-4 Bildad had before given Job good advice and encouragement; here he used nothing but rebukes, and declared his ruin. And he concluded that Job shut out the providence of God from the management of human affairs, because he would not admit himself to be wicked.</body></html>
