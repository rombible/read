The last clause is a direct quotation from Job in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-18.htm" title="And surely the mountains falling comes to nothing, and the rock is removed out of his place.">Job 14:18</a>; it looks, therefore, very much like a wilful perversion of Job's words, for it is clear that he used them very differently. Even if there were no intentional misrepresentation Bildad applies Job's words to his own purposes. The drift of his question is, "Can you expect the course of God's providence to be altered for you? On the contrary, the retribution that awaits the wicked is sure and swift; for verily (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-5.htm" title="Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.">Job 18:5</a>) the light of the wicked shall be put out."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He teareth himself in his anger</span>. The Hebrew idiom, which allows of rapid transitions from the second to the third person, and <span class="accented">vice versa</span>, cannot be transferred without harshness to our modern speech. Our Revisers have given the true force of the original by discarding the third person, and translating, "Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger." There is probably an allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-9.htm">Job 16:9</a>, where Job had represented God as "tearing him in his wrath." Bildad says it is not God who tests him - he tears himself. <span class="cmt_word">Shall the earth be forsaken for thee?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Shall the course of the world be altered to meet thy wishes, to suit thy case?" Job had wished for all manner of impossible things (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-3.htm">Job 3:3-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-32.htm">Job 9:32-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-21.htm">Job 13:21, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-21.htm">Job 16:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a>). Bildad's reproach is thus not wholly unjust. But he makes no allowance for the wild utter-shoes of one who is half distraught. <span class="cmt_word">And shall the rock be removed out of his place?</span> Shall that which is most solid and firm give way, and alter its nature? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-4 Bildad had before given Job good advice and encouragement; here he used nothing but rebukes, and declared his ruin. And he concluded that Job shut out the providence of God from the management of human affairs, because he would not admit himself to be wicked.</body></html>
