But it is far more natural to regard Job as bringing up the words which God had spoken to him, to ponder on them and answer them, or at any rate to hang his reply upon them, than to imagine God twice interrupting Job in the humble confession that he was anxious to make. We must understand, then, after the word "knowledge," an ellipse of "thou sayest." <span class="cmt_word">Therefore have I uttered that I understood not</span>. <span class="accented">Therefore</span>, because of that reproof of thine, I perceive that, in what I said to my friends, I "darkened counsel," <span class="accented">-</span> I "uttered that I understood not," words which did not clear the matter in controversy, but obscured it. <span class="cmt_word">I dealt, in fact, with things too wonderful for me</span> - beyond my compre-hension - <span class="cmt_word">which I knew not</span>, of which I had no real knowledge, but only a semblance of knowledge, and on which, therefore, I had better have been silent. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:1-6 Job was now sensible of his guilt; he would no longer speak in his own excuse; he abhorred himself as a sinner in heart and life, especially for murmuring against God, and took shame to himself. When the understanding is enlightened by the Spirit of grace, our knowledge of Divine things as far exceeds what we had before, as the sight of the eyes excels report and common fame. By the teachings of men, God reveals his Son to us; but by the teachings of his Spirit he reveals his Son in us, Ga 1:16, and changes us into the same image, 2Co 3:18. It concerns us to be deeply humbled for the sins of which we are convinced. Self-loathing is ever the companion of true repentance. The Lord will bring those whom he loveth, to adore him in self-abasement; while true grace will always lead them to confess their sins without self-justifying.</body></html>
