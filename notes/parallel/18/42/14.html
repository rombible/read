The name "Jemima" is probably derived from <span class="accented">yom</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>), "day," and means "Fair as the day." <span class="cmt_word">And the name of the second, Kesia</span>. "Kezia" (rather, "Keziah") was the Hebrew name of the spice which the Greeks and Romans called "cassia," a spice closely allied to cinnamon, and much esteemed in the East (see Herod., 3:110). <span class="cmt_word">And the name of the third, Keren-happuch</span>; literally, <span class="accented">horn</span> <span class="accented">of stibium - stibium</span> being the dye (antimony) with which Oriental women have from a remote antiquity been in the habit of anointing the upper and lower eyelids in order to give lustre to the eye (compare the 'Pulpit Commentary' on the 'Second Book of Kings,' p. 194). The three names, according to Oriental notions, implied either sweetness or beauty. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:10-17 In the beginning of this book we had Job's patience under his troubles, for an example; here, for our encouragement to follow that example, we have his happy end. His troubles began in Satan's malice, which God restrained; his restoration began in God's mercy, which Satan could not oppose. Mercy did not return when Job was disputing with his friends, but when he was praying for them. God is served and pleased with our warm devotions, not with our warm disputes. God doubled Job's possessions. We may lose much for the Lord, but we shall not lose any thing by him. Whether the Lord gives us health and temporal blessings or not, if we patiently suffer according to his will, in the end we shall be happy. Job's estate increased. The blessing of the Lord makes rich; it is he that gives us power to get wealth, and gives success in honest endeavours. The last days of a good man sometimes prove his best, his last works his best works, his last comforts his best comforts; for his path, like that of the morning light, shines more and more unto the perfect day.</body></html>
