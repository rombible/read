Some have supposed, from a comparison of this passage with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-16.htm" title="And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.">Genesis 23:16</a>, which relates the corresponding transaction between Abraham and the sons of Heth, that the value of the <span class= "ital">kes?t?h </span>was four shekels, but this is, of course, not certain from these narratives. Tradition says that the <span class= "ital">kes?t?h </span>was a coin with the figure of & lamb stamped upon it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then came there unto him all his brethren</span>. Job's "brethren," and his desertion by them in his misfortunes, had been mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13</a>. Now these fair-weather friends flocked to him again, and professed affection and interest, ignoring probably, or excusing, their long absence and neglect. <span class="cmt_word">And all his sisters</span>. One sex had behaved no better to him than the other. His nearest female relatives had failed to show themselves the "ministering angels" that they are commonly accounted, even when "pain and anguish" most "wrung his brow<span class="cmt_word">." And all they that had been of his acquaintance before</span>. Job, like other wealthy and prosperous men had during the time of his prosperity had "troops of friends" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-8.htm">Job 29:8-10, 21-25</a>). When adversity swooped down they fell away. Now they had the effrontery to claim his acquaintance once more, and to come and be his guests; they did eat bread with him in his house. Nay, more, they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him, whereof the worst part was their own coldness and desertion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13, 14, 19</a>). Finally, to establish the renewed friendship, every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an ear-ring of gold. The money given is said to have been a <span class="accented">kesitah</span> which means probably a certain weight of silver, though whether a shekel or not is uncertain. The word belongs to the earlier Hebrew, being found only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>, and in the present passage. Ear-rings were commonly worn in the East by men as well as women, as appears from the Egyptian, Assyrian, and Persian sculptures. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:10-17 In the beginning of this book we had Job's patience under his troubles, for an example; here, for our encouragement to follow that example, we have his happy end. His troubles began in Satan's malice, which God restrained; his restoration began in God's mercy, which Satan could not oppose. Mercy did not return when Job was disputing with his friends, but when he was praying for them. God is served and pleased with our warm devotions, not with our warm disputes. God doubled Job's possessions. We may lose much for the Lord, but we shall not lose any thing by him. Whether the Lord gives us health and temporal blessings or not, if we patiently suffer according to his will, in the end we shall be happy. Job's estate increased. The blessing of the Lord makes rich; it is he that gives us power to get wealth, and gives success in honest endeavours. The last days of a good man sometimes prove his best, his last works his best works, his last comforts his best comforts; for his path, like that of the morning light, shines more and more unto the perfect day.</body></html>
