In the first part (vers. 1-6) Job makes his final submission, humbling himself in the dust before God. In the second (vers. 7-17) the historical framework, in which the general dialogue is set, is resumed and brought to a close. God's approval of Job is declared, and his anger denounced against the three friends, who are required to expiate their guilt by a sacrifice, and only promised forgiveness if Job will intercede on their behalf (ver. 8). The sacrifice takes place (ver. 9); and then a brief account is appended of Job's after life - his prosperity, his reconciliation with his family and friends, his wealth, his sons and daughters, and his death in a good old age, when he was "full of days" (vers. 10-17.). The poetic structure, begun in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-3.htm">Job 3:3</a>, is continued to the end of ver. 6, when the style changes into prose of the same character as that employed in ch.. 1. 2, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-1.htm">Job 32:1-5</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Job answered the Lord, and said, I know that thou caner do every thing</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I know and acknowledge thy omnipotence, which thou hast set forth so magnificently before me in ch. 38-41.

When the understanding is enlightened by the Spirit of grace, our knowledge of Divine things as far exceeds what we had before, as the sight of the eyes excels report and common fame. By the teachings of men, God reveals his Son to us; but by the teachings of his Spirit he reveals his Son in us, Ga 1:16, and changes us into the same image, 2Co 3:18. It concerns us to be deeply humbled for the sins of which we are convinced. Self-loathing is ever the companion of true repentance. The Lord will bring those whom he loveth, to adore him in self-abasement; while true grace will always lead them to confess their sins without self-justifying.</body></html>
