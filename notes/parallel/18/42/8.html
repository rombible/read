and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.">Numbers 23:2-29</a>). This is probably one indication out of many that the age of Job was that of Moses, or before it. "My servant Job shall pray for you." This, strange to say, was the very promise with which Eliphaz himself had closed his third and last speech. His words therefore received a striking fulfilment in the case of himself and his friends. The intercession of Job seems to show us that his character is a typical one, representing to us the character of Christ as the sufferer and the mediator on behalf of man; and as in Job there is no trace of acquaintance with the Divine covenant, the book shows us a sort of anticipation of the Gospel to the Gentile world, that the mercies of God are not limited, as some have thought, to the chosen race, but that the principles of God's action are the same universally. He deals with men upon a principle of mediation: whether the mediator be Moses, as the mediator of the first covenant; or Job, who was the accepted mediator for his friends beyond the pale of the covenant; or whether the mediator be Jesus Christ, as the one Mediator between God and man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams</span>. (On the early and widespread prevalence of the rite of sacrifice,-see the comment upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5</a>.) (On the preference, for sacrificial purposes, of the number seven, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-18.htm">Leviticus 23:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-1.htm">Numbers 23:1, 14, 29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11, 19, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-2.htm">Numbers 29:2, 8, 36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-26.htm">1 Chronicles 15:26</a> . <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-21.htm">2 Chronicles 29:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-35.htm">Ezra 8:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-23.htm">Ezekiel 45:23</a>, etc.) It is noticeable that "seven bullocks and seven rams" was <span class="accented">exactly</span> the offering of the Moabite king Balak, and his prophet Balaam, contemporary with Moses. <span class="cmt_word">And go to my servant Job</span>.

Lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job (see the comment on the preceding verse). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:7-9 After the Lord had convinced and humbled Job, and brought him to repentance, he owned him, comforted him, and put honour upon him. The devil had undertaken to prove Job a hypocrite, and his three friends had condemned him as a wicked man; but if God say, Well done, thou good and faithful servant, it is of little consequence who says otherwise. Job's friends had wronged God, by making prosperity a mark of the true church, and affliction a certain proof of God's wrath. Job had referred things to the future judgment and the future state, more than his friends, therefore he spake of God that which was right, better than his friends had done. And as Job prayed and offered sacrifice for those that had grieved and wounded his spirit, so Christ prayed for his persecutors, and ever lives, making intercession for the transgressors. Job's friends were good men, and belonged to God, and He would not let them be in their mistake any more than Job; but having humbled him by a discourse out of the whirlwind, he takes another way to humble them. They are not to argue the matter again, but they must agree in a sacrifice and a prayer, and that must reconcile them, Those who differ in judgment about lesser things, yet are one in Christ the great Sacrifice, and ought therefore to love and bear with one another. When God was angry with Job's friends, he put them in a way to make peace with him. Our quarrels with God always begin on our part, but the making peace begins on his. Peace with God is to be had only in his own way, and upon his own terms. These will never seem hard to those who know how to value this blessing: they will be glad of it, like Job's friends, upon any terms, though ever so humbling. Job did not insult over his friends, but God being graciously reconciled to him, he was easily reconciled to them. In all our prayers and services we should aim to be accepted of the Lord; not to have praise of men, but to please God.</body></html>
