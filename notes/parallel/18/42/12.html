That Job's latter end should be blessed had been the promise of all his friends (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-24.htm" title="And you shall know that your tabernacle shall be in peace; and you shall visit your habitation, and shall not sin.">Job 5:24</a>, &c., <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/8-7.htm" title="Though your beginning was small, yet your latter end should greatly increase.">Job 8:7-20</a>, &c., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-16.htm" title="Because you shall forget your misery, and remember it as waters that pass away:">Job 11:16</a>, &c., 22:27, &c.), but then it was hampered with a condition which involved the falsehood of all Job's previous life, and it was the unjust imputation of this falsehood to Job which was an offence against the truth of God, and Was so regarded by Him. Truth had to be violated in order that God's justice might stand, which was the greatest possible offence and indignity to the Divine justice.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning</span> (comp. above, ver. 10). The restoration of prosperity, prophesied by Eliphaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-18.htm">Job 5:18</a> 26), Bildad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-20.htm">Job 8:20, 21</a>), and Zophar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-13.htm">Job 11:13-19</a>), but not expected by Job, came, not in consequence of any universal law, but by the will of God, and his pure grace and favour. It in no way pledged God to compensate worldly adversity by worldly prosperity in the case of any other sufferer; and certainly the general law seems to be that such earthly compensation is withheld. But, in combination with the instinct which demands that retributive justice shall prevail universally, it may be taken as an earnest of God's ultimate dealings with men, and a sure indication that, if not on earth, at least in the future state; each man shall receive "the deeds done in the body," according to that he hath done, whether it be good or evil. <span class="cmt_word">For he had</span> (rather, <span class="accented">and he had</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses</span>. In every case the exact <span class="accented">double</span> of his original possessions (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>; and comp. above, ver. 12). We need not suppose, however, that either the round numbers, or the exact duplicity, are historical. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:10-17 In the beginning of this book we had Job's patience under his troubles, for an example; here, for our encouragement to follow that example, we have his happy end. His troubles began in Satan's malice, which God restrained; his restoration began in God's mercy, which Satan could not oppose. Mercy did not return when Job was disputing with his friends, but when he was praying for them. God is served and pleased with our warm devotions, not with our warm disputes. God doubled Job's possessions. We may lose much for the Lord, but we shall not lose any thing by him. Whether the Lord gives us health and temporal blessings or not, if we patiently suffer according to his will, in the end we shall be happy. Job's estate increased. The blessing of the Lord makes rich; it is he that gives us power to get wealth, and gives success in honest endeavours. The last days of a good man sometimes prove his best, his last works his best works, his last comforts his best comforts; for his path, like that of the morning light, shines more and more unto the perfect day.</body></html>
