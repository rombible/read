In the former sense it is possible that the Pyramids may here be hinted at.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With kings and counsellers of the earth</span>. As a great man himself, nobly born probably, Job expects that his place in another world would have been with kings and nobles (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9-11</a>, where the King of Babylon, on entering Sheol, finds himself among "all the kings of the nations"). <span class="cmt_word">Which built desolate places for themselves</span>. Some understand "restorers of cities which had become waste and desolate;" others, "builders of edifices which, since they built them, have become desolate;" others, again, "builders of desolate and dreary piles," such as the Pyramids, and the rock-tombs common in Arabia, which were desolate and dreary from the time that they were built. The brevity studied by the writer makes his meaning somewhat obscure. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:11-19 Job complained of those present at his birth, for their tender attention to him. No creature comes into the world so helpless as man. God's power and providence upheld our frail lives, and his pity and patience spared our forfeited lives. Natural affection is put into parents' hearts by God. To desire to die that we may be with Christ, that we may be free from sin, is the effect and evidence of grace; but to desire to die, only that we may be delivered from the troubles of this life, savours of corruption. It is our wisdom and duty to make the best of that which is, be it living or dying; and so to live to the Lord, and die to the Lord, as in both to be his, Ro 14:8. Observe how Job describes the repose of the grave; There the wicked cease from troubling. When persecutors die, they can no longer persecute. There the weary are at rest: in the grave they rest from all their labours. And a rest from sin, temptation, conflict, sorrows, and labours, remains in the presence and enjoyment of God. There believers rest in Jesus, nay, as far as we trust in the Lord Jesus and obey him, we here find rest to our souls, though in the world we have tribulation.</body></html>
