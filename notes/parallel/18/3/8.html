"Let it be as cursed as Job's birth day."<p>These people are further described as being ready to arouse leviathan (Authorised Version, "raise up their mourning"), or the crocodile--persons as mad and desperate as <span class= "ital">that. </span>Let the most hopeless and reckless of mankind select that day as the one which they would choose to curse. This seems to be Job's meaning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let them curse it that curse the day</span>. Very different explanations are given of this passage. Some suppose it to mean, "Let those desperate men curse it who are in the habit of cursing their day," like Job himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-1.htm">Job 3:1</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-14.htm">Jeremiah 20:14</a>). Others suggest a reference to such as claimed power to curse days, and to divide them into the lucky and the unlucky. In this case Job would mean, "Let the sorcerers who curse days curse especially this day," and would thus seem, if not to sanction the practice, at any rate to express a certain amount of belief in the sorcerers' power. The second clause has also a double interpretation, which adapts it to either of these two suggested meanings (<span class="accented">vide</span> <span class="accented">infra</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Who are ready to raise up their mourning</span>. This is an impossible rendering. Translate (with the Revised Version), who <span class="accented">are ready to rouse up leviathan.</span> "Rousing leviathan" may be understood in two ways. It may be regarded as spoken in the literal sense of those who are rash enough and desperate enough to stir up the fury of the crocodile (see the comment on Job 41:1), or in a metaphorical sense of such as stir up to action by their sorceries the great power of evil, symbolized in Oriental mythologies by a huge serpent, or dragon, or crocodile. On the whole, the second and deeper sense seems preferable; and we may conceive of Job as believing in the power of sorcery, and wishing it used against the night which he so much dislikes. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-10 For seven days Job's friends sat by him in silence, without offering consolidation: at the same time Satan assaulted his mind to shake his confidence, and to fill him with hard thoughts of God. The permission seems to have extended to this, as well as to torturing the body. Job was an especial type of Christ, whose inward sufferings, both in the garden and on the cross, were the most dreadful; and arose in a great degree from the assaults of Satan in that hour of darkness. These inward trials show the reason of the change that took place in Job's conduct, from entire submission to the will of God, to the impatience which appears here, and in other parts of the book. The believer, who knows that a few drops of this bitter cup are more dreadful than the sharpest outward afflictions, while he is favoured with a sweet sense of the love and presence of God, will not be surprised to find that Job proved a man of like passions with others; but will rejoice that Satan was disappointed, and could not prove him a hypocrite; for though he cursed the day of his birth, he did not curse his God. Job doubtless was afterwards ashamed of these wishes, and we may suppose what must be his judgment of them now he is in everlasting happiness.</body></html>
