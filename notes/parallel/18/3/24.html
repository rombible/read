The word translated "roaring" is used primarily of the roar of a lion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-3.htm">Zechariah 11:3</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>); secondarily, of the loud cries uttered by men who suffer pain (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-4.htm">Psalm 32:4</a>).

Perhaps the loud sound of rushing water is also alluded to. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:20-26 Job was like a man who had lost his way, and had no prospect of escape, or hope of better times. But surely he was in an ill frame for death when so unwilling to live. Let it be our constant care to get ready for another world, and then leave it to God to order our removal thither as he thinks fit. Grace teaches us in the midst of life's greatest comforts, to be willing to die, and in the midst of its greatest crosses, to be willing to live. Job's way was hid; he knew not wherefore God contended with him. The afflicted and tempted Christian knows something of this heaviness; when he has been looking too much at the things that are seen, some chastisement of his heavenly Father will give him a taste of this disgust of life, and a glance at these dark regions of despair. Nor is there any help until God shall restore to him the joys of his salvation. Blessed be God, the earth is full of his goodness, though full of man's wickedness. This life may be made tolerable if we attend to our duty. We look for eternal mercy, if willing to receive Christ as our Saviour.</body></html>
