Many of the ancients thought that it was best not to be born; and next best, if one were born, to quit the earth as soon as possible. Herodotus says that with the Trauri, a tribe of Thracians, it was the custom, whenever a child was born, for all its kindred to sit round it in a circle, and weep for the woes that it would have to endure now that it was come into the world; while, on the other hand, whenever a person died, they buried him with laughter and rejoicings, since they said that he was now free from a host of sufferings, and enjoyed the completest happiness (Herod., 5:4). Sophocles expresses the feeling with great terseness and force: <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fb7;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f25;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (Ed. Col., 1225-1228): "Not to be born is best of all; once born, next best it is by far to go back there from whence one came as speedily as possible." Modern pessimism sums up all in the phrase that "life is not worth living." <span class="cmt_word">Why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</span> As so often, the second clause of the distich repeats the idea of the first, merely varying the phraseology. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:11-19 Job complained of those present at his birth, for their tender attention to him. No creature comes into the world so helpless as man. God's power and providence upheld our frail lives, and his pity and patience spared our forfeited lives. Natural affection is put into parents' hearts by God. To desire to die that we may be with Christ, that we may be free from sin, is the effect and evidence of grace; but to desire to die, only that we may be delivered from the troubles of this life, savours of corruption. It is our wisdom and duty to make the best of that which is, be it living or dying; and so to live to the Lord, and die to the Lord, as in both to be his, Ro 14:8. Observe how Job describes the repose of the grave; There the wicked cease from troubling. When persecutors die, they can no longer persecute. There the weary are at rest: in the grave they rest from all their labours. And a rest from sin, temptation, conflict, sorrows, and labours, remains in the presence and enjoyment of God. There believers rest in Jesus, nay, as far as we trust in the Lord Jesus and obey him, we here find rest to our souls, though in the world we have tribulation.</body></html>
