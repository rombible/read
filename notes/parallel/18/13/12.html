Or, as some understand it, "Your high fabrics, or defences, are fabrics of clay," as an independent parallelism.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Your remembrances are like unto ashes</span>. The "remembrances" intended are probably the wise saws, embodiments of the ancient wisdom, on which Job's adversaries have relied in their disputations with him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-8.htm">Job 8:8-11</a>, etc.). These Job declares to be mere dust and ashes - useless, worthless, such as the first breath of air wilt blow away. <span class="cmt_word">Your bodies to bodies of clay</span>; rather, <span class="accented">your mounds</span> or <span class="accented">your defences</span> (see the Revised Version). These defences, Job <span class="accented">says - i.e</span>, the arguments by which his opponents support their views - are no better than "defences of clay " - easy to batter down and destroy. The ancient defences of a town were usually either of stone, as at Khorsabad ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. pp. 278, 279), or of crude brick faced with burnt brick, as at Babylon and elsewhere. But Job seems to be speaking of something more primitive than either of these - mere earthworks, like the Roman <span class="accented">aggera</span> hastily thrown up and easy to level with the ground. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-12 With self-preference, Job declared that he needed not to be taught by them. Those who dispute are tempted to magnify themselves, and lower their brethren, more than is fit. When dismayed or distressed with the fear of wrath, the force of temptation, or the weight of affliction, we should apply to the Physician of our souls, who never rejects any, never prescribes amiss, and never leaves any case uncured. To Him we may speak at all times. To broken hearts and wounded consciences, all creatures, without Christ, are physicians of no value. Job evidently speaks with a very angry spirit against his friends. They had advanced some truths which nearly concerned Job, but the heart unhumbled before God, never meekly receives the reproofs of men.</body></html>
