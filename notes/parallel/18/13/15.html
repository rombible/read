For though there is, as there can be, no gleam of hope for victory in this conflict, yet, notwithstanding, Job will not forego his conviction of integrity; for the voice of conscience is the voice of God, and if he knows himself to be innocent, he would belie and dishonour God as well as himself in renouncing his innocence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him</span>; rather, <span class="accented">yet will</span> I <span class="accented">wait for him.</span> The passage is one of the few in this book where there are two readings - <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5dc;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5dc;</span>. Those who prefer the latter commonly render it, "I have no hope;" but it is pointed out by Canon Cook that there are reasons for regarding <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;</span> as an archaic form for <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>, which sometimes takes its place. If this be not allowed the reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> will have to be preferred, on the double authority of the versions and of the context. Job cannot possibly have said, in one verse, "I have no hope," and in the next, "He (God) shall be my Salvation." <span class="cmt_word">But I will maintain mine own ways before him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "I will maintain that they are right and good ways, not open to the imputations that my 'friends' have cast upon them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-6.htm">Job 8:6, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-11.htm">Job 11:11, 14, 20</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:13-22 Job resolved to cleave to the testimony his own conscience gave of his uprightness. He depended upon God for justification and salvation, the two great things we hope for through Christ. Temporal salvation he little expected, but of his eternal salvation he was very confident; that God would not only be his Saviour to make him happy, but his salvation, in the sight and enjoyment of whom he should be happy. He knew himself not to be a hypocrite, and concluded that he should not be rejected. We should be well pleased with God as a Friend, even when he seems against us as an enemy. We must believe that all shall work for good to us, even when all seems to make against us. We must cleave to God, yea, though we cannot for the present find comfort in him. In a dying hour, we must derive from him living comforts; and this is to trust in him, though he slay us.</body></html>
