He taxes them with the fabrication of lies (ver 4), with want of skill as physicians of souls (ver. 4), with vindicating God by reasonings in which they do not themselves believe (vers. 7, 8), and consequently with really mocking him (ver. 9). Having warned them that they are more likely to offend God than to please him by such arguments as those that they have urged (vers. 10-12), he calls on them to hold their peace, and allow him to plead his cause with God (ver. 13). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely I would speak to the Almighty</span>. It is not Job's wish to argue his ease with his three friends, but to reason it out with God. His friends, however, interfere with this design, check it, thwart it, prevent him from carrying it out. He must therefore first speak a few words to them. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">I desire to reason with God</span>. Compare God's own invitation to his people, "Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>), and again, "Put me in remembrance, let us plead together; declare thou, that thou mayest be justified" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-26.htm">Isaiah 43:26</a>); which indicate God's gracious willingness to allow men to plead on their own behalf before him, and do their best to justify themselves. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-12 With self-preference, Job declared that he needed not to be taught by them. Those who dispute are tempted to magnify themselves, and lower their brethren, more than is fit. When dismayed or distressed with the fear of wrath, the force of temptation, or the weight of affliction, we should apply to the Physician of our souls, who never rejects any, never prescribes amiss, and never leaves any case uncured. To Him we may speak at all times. To broken hearts and wounded consciences, all creatures, without Christ, are physicians of no value. Job evidently speaks with a very angry spirit against his friends. They had advanced some truths which nearly concerned Job, but the heart unhumbled before God, never meekly receives the reproofs of men.</body></html>
