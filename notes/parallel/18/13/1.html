Ver. 1 is little more than a repetition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-9.htm">Job 12:9</a> and ver. 2 of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-3.htm">Job 12:3</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it</span>. All the particulars mentioned concerning God's government of the world in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-6.htm">Job 12:6-25</a> are derived by Job from his own experience. His eye has seen them or his ear has heard them. He is not indebted to others for information on these simple points, which he regards as necessarily impressed by their experience on all grown men (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-9.htm">Job 12:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-12 With self-preference, Job declared that he needed not to be taught by them. Those who dispute are tempted to magnify themselves, and lower their brethren, more than is fit. When dismayed or distressed with the fear of wrath, the force of temptation, or the weight of affliction, we should apply to the Physician of our souls, who never rejects any, never prescribes amiss, and never leaves any case uncured. To Him we may speak at all times. To broken hearts and wounded consciences, all creatures, without Christ, are physicians of no value. Job evidently speaks with a very angry spirit against his friends. They had advanced some truths which nearly concerned Job, but the heart unhumbled before God, never meekly receives the reproofs of men.</body></html>
