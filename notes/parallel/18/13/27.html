you have made me an abomination to them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.">Psalm 88:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-7.htm" title="Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise your name: the righteous shall compass me about; for you shall deal bountifully with me.">Psalm 142:7</a>, &c.). There is a difficulty in these two verses, arising from the pronouns. Some understand the subject to be the fetter: "Thou puttest my feet in the fetter that watcheth over all my paths, and imprinteth itself upon the roots of my feet, and it (the foot) consumeth like a rotten thing, and like a garment that is moth-eaten." Others refer the "he" to Job himself; and others to man, the subject of the following chapter. In the Hebrew future tense the third person feminine and the second person masculine are alike, and the word for fetter, which is only found here and at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-11.htm" title="He puts my feet in the stocks, he marks all my paths.">Job 33:11</a>, where Elihu quotes these words, may possibly be feminine in this place, though it is clear that Elihu understood Job to be speaking of God. Probably by the "he" introduced so abruptly is meant the object of all this watching and persecution.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-11.htm">Job 33:11</a>). The punishment is said to be still in use among the Bedouin Arabs. It was well known to the Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-22.htm">Proverbs 7:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-26.htm">Jeremiah 29:26</a>), to the Greeks (Herod., 9:87), and to the Romans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-24.htm">Acts 16:24</a>). And lookest narrowly unto all my paths. Not allowing me to escape thee. Thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet; rather, <span class="accented">upon the soles of my feet.</span> The "print" intended is probably a mark which the stocks were in the habit of making (see Professor Sayee, in <span class="accented">Sunday at Home</span> December, 1890, p. 125). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:23-28 Job begs to have his sins discovered to him. A true penitent is willing to know the worst of himself; and we should all desire to know what our transgressions are, that we may confess them, and guard against them for the future. Job complains sorrowfully of God's severe dealings with him. Time does not wear out the guilt of sin. When God writes bitter things against us, his design is to make us bring forgotten sins to mind, and so to bring us to repent of them, as to break us off from them. Let young persons beware of indulging in sin. Even in this world they may so possess the sins of their youth, as to have months of sorrow for moments of pleasure. Their wisdom is to remember their Creator in their early days, that they may have assured hope, and sweet peace of conscience, as the solace of their declining years. Job also complains that his present mistakes are strictly noticed. So far from this, God deals not with us according to our deserts. This was the language of Job's melancholy views. If God marks our steps, and narrowly examines our paths, in judgment, both body and soul feel his righteous vengeance. This will be the awful case of unbelievers, yet there is salvation devised, provided, and made known in Christ.</body></html>
