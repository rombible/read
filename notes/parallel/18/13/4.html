A harsh expression, indicating that Job was thoroughly exasperated. The lies which his friends had forged were, partly, misrepresentations of what he had said, as for example <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-4.htm">Job 11:4</a>, but mainly statements, more or less covert, which implied that he had brought all his calamities on himself by a course of evil-doing (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-13.htm">Job 8:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-11.htm">Job 11:11, 14, 20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye are all physicians of no value</span>. Job's friends had come to him to "comfort" him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>), and act as physicians of his soul. But they had entirely failed to be of the least service. They had not even understood his case. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-12 With self-preference, Job declared that he needed not to be taught by them. Those who dispute are tempted to magnify themselves, and lower their brethren, more than is fit. When dismayed or distressed with the fear of wrath, the force of temptation, or the weight of affliction, we should apply to the Physician of our souls, who never rejects any, never prescribes amiss, and never leaves any case uncured. To Him we may speak at all times. To broken hearts and wounded consciences, all creatures, without Christ, are physicians of no value. Job evidently speaks with a very angry spirit against his friends. They had advanced some truths which nearly concerned Job, but the heart unhumbled before God, never meekly receives the reproofs of men.</body></html>
