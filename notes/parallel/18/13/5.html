Oh that they would have held it <span class="accented">altogether</span>! Their words had done nothing but exasperate and goad almost to madness. There is a mournful pathos in Job's entreates to them to be silent (comp ver. 13). <span class="cmt_word">And it should be your wisdom</span>. "Speech," it has been said, "is silvern, silence is golden." No doubt" there is a time for everything<span class="cmt_word">...</span> a time to keep silence, and a time to speak" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1, 7</a>); nor is the rule of La Trappe altogether a wise one. But probably ten times as much harm is done in the world by speaking as by keeping silence. "Words for God" need especial care and caution. If they do not do good, the harm that they may do is incalculable. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-12 With self-preference, Job declared that he needed not to be taught by them. Those who dispute are tempted to magnify themselves, and lower their brethren, more than is fit. When dismayed or distressed with the fear of wrath, the force of temptation, or the weight of affliction, we should apply to the Physician of our souls, who never rejects any, never prescribes amiss, and never leaves any case uncured. To Him we may speak at all times. To broken hearts and wounded consciences, all creatures, without Christ, are physicians of no value. Job evidently speaks with a very angry spirit against his friends. They had advanced some truths which nearly concerned Job, but the heart unhumbled before God, never meekly receives the reproofs of men.</body></html>
