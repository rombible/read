As it is manifestly the traditionally orthodox position that his friends assume, it is refreshing to find that there may be some truth spoken for God by what is not so reckoned, and that more ultimate truth may exist in honest doubt than is sometimes found in the profession of a loosely-held creed. So the Laureate:<p>"There lives more truth in honest doubt,<p>Believe me, than in half the creeds."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What ye know</span>, the same do <span class="cmt_word">I know also</span>. Job's friends have claimed to instruct him and set him right, on the ground of their age and experience (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-27.htm">Job 5:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-8.htm">Job 8:8-10</a>), He protests that, in the matters on which they have lectured him, they have no advantage over himself - he knows all that they know - in truth, the knowledge is open to all (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-3.htm">Job 12:3</a>). I am not inferior unto you.

Those who dispute are tempted to magnify themselves, and lower their brethren, more than is fit. When dismayed or distressed with the fear of wrath, the force of temptation, or the weight of affliction, we should apply to the Physician of our souls, who never rejects any, never prescribes amiss, and never leaves any case uncured. To Him we may speak at all times. To broken hearts and wounded consciences, all creatures, without Christ, are physicians of no value. Job evidently speaks with a very angry spirit against his friends. They had advanced some truths which nearly concerned Job, but the heart unhumbled before God, never meekly receives the reproofs of men.</body></html>
