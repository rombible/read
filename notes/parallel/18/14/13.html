Job desires to have God's protection in that" land of darkness," and to be "hidden" there by him until his wrath be past. It has been generally supposed that he means after his death; but Schultens thinks his desire was to descend to Sheol <span class="accented">alive</span> and there remain, while his punishment continued, hidden from the eyes of men. <span class="cmt_word">That thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past.</span> Job assumes that, if he is being punished for his youthful sins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-26.htm">Job 13:26</a>), his punishment will not be for long - at any rate, not for ever; God's anger will at last be satisfied and cease. <span class="cmt_word">That thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!</span> How long he may have to suffer be does not greatly care.

But when man is cut off by death, he is for ever removed from his place in this world. The life of man may fitly be compared to the waters of a land flood, which spread far, but soon dry up. All Job's expressions here show his belief in the great doctrine of the resurrection. Job's friends proving miserable comforters, he pleases himself with the expectation of a change. If our sins are forgiven, and our hearts renewed to holiness, heaven will be the rest of our souls, while our bodies are hidden in the grave from the malice of our enemies, feeling no more pain from our corruptions, or our corrections.</body></html>
