It is not a dispassionate inquiry, but an expression of hopelessness. Let a man once die, and of course he cannot live again. Were it otherwise, then, Job says, <span class="cmt_word">all the days of my appointed time will I wait;</span> or, rather (as in the Revised Version), <span class="accented">all the days of my warfare would</span> I <span class="accented">wait</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I would patiently endure any sufferings in the larger hope that would then be open to me. <span class="cmt_word">I would wait till my change</span> (rather, <span class="accented">my renewal</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>come</span>. The exact nature of the 'renewal" which Job seems here to expect is obscure. Perhaps he is pursuing the idea, broached in ver. 13, of his being conveyed <span class="accented">alive</span> to Hades, and looks forward to a furthur renewed life after he is released from that "land of darkness." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:7-15 Though a tree is cut down, yet, in a moist situation, shoots come forth, and grow up as a newly planted tree. But when man is cut off by death, he is for ever removed from his place in this world. The life of man may fitly be compared to the waters of a land flood, which spread far, but soon dry up. All Job's expressions here show his belief in the great doctrine of the resurrection. Job's friends proving miserable comforters, he pleases himself with the expectation of a change. If our sins are forgiven, and our hearts renewed to holiness, heaven will be the rest of our souls, while our bodies are hidden in the grave from the malice of our enemies, feeling no more pain from our corruptions, or our corrections.</body></html>
