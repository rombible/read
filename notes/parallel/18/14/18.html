Job here resumes the lament 'over human infirmity, with which the chapter opens (vers. 1-12); but he has, perhaps, in this passage, his own case mote distinctly presented to his consciousness. With the wealth of metaphor which characterizes his utterances, he compares the ruin of a prosperous man <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to the sudden collapse of a mountain; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to the removal of a rock out of its place; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to the wearing away of stones by the constant flow of streams; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> to the destruction of alluvial tracts by floods. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Mountains collapse, either by volcanic agency, which is quite as much shown in the subsidence as in the elevation of the soil, or by landslips, which are most usually the results of heavy rains. <span class="cmt_word">And the rock is removed out of his place</span>. Rocks are sometimes split by frost, and topple over when a thaw comes; at other times, heavy floods remove them from their accustomed place; occasionally earthquakes overturn them, and cause them to fall with a crash. There is also a removal of rocks to much greeter distances, by means of glaciers and icebergs; but of these Job is not likely to have known. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:16-22 Job's faith and hope spake, and grace appeared to revive; but depravity again prevailed. He represents God as carrying matters to extremity against him. The Lord must prevail against all who contend with him. God may send disease and pain, we may lose all comfort in those near and dear to us, every hope of earthly happiness may be destroyed, but God will receive the believer into realms of eternal happiness. But what a change awaits the prosperous unbeliever! How will he answer when God shall call him to his tribunal? The Lord is yet upon a mercy-seat, ready to be gracious. Oh that sinners would be wise, that they would consider their latter end! While man's flesh is upon him, that is, the body he is so loth to lay down, it shall have pain; and while his soul is within him, that is, the spirit he is so loth to resign, it shall mourn. Dying work is hard work; dying pangs often are sore pangs. It is folly for men to defer repentance to a death-bed, and to have that to do which is the one thing needful, when unfit to do anything.</body></html>
