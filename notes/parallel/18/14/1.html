It would seem that the patriarch, having vented his feelings, experiences a certain relief, an interval of calm, in which, his own woes pressing less heavily upon him, he is content to moralize on the general condition of humanity. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Man that is born of a woman</span>. In this fact Job sees the origin of man's inherent weakness. He is "born of a woman," who is "the weaker vessel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>). He is conceived by her in uncleanness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-5.htm">Psalm 51:5</a>; comp. below, ver. 4), brought forth in sorrow and pain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>) suckled at her breasts, placed for years under her guidance. No wonder that he shares the weakness of which she is a sort of type. <span class="cmt_word">Is of few days</span>; literally, <span class="accented">short of days.</span> Length and shortness of days are, no doubt, relative; and it is difficult to say what term of life would not have seemed short to men as they looked back upon it. To Jacob, at the age of a hundred and thirty, it appeared that "<span class="accented">few</span> and evil had the days of the years of his life been" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-9.htm">Genesis 47:9</a>). Methuselah, perhaps, thought the same. We all, as we come towards old age, and death draws manifestly near, feel as if we had only just begun to live, as if, at any rate, we had not done half our work, and were about to be cut off before our time. But would the case be seriously different if our tale of years were doubled? And fall of trouble (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-7.htm">Job 5:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-6 Job enlarges upon the condition of man, addressing himself also to God. Every man of Adam's fallen race is short-lived. All his show of beauty, happiness, and splendour falls before the stroke of sickness or death, as the flower before the scythe; or passes away like the shadow. How is it possible for a man's conduct to be sinless, when his heart is by nature unclean? Here is a clear proof that Job understood and believed the doctrine of original sin. He seems to have intended it as a plea, why the Lord should not deal with him according to his own works, but according to His mercy and grace. It is determined, in the counsel and decree of God, how long we shall live. Our times are in his hands, the powers of nature act under him; in him we live and move. And it is very useful to reflect seriously on the shortness and uncertainty of human life, and the fading nature of all earthly enjoyments. But it is still more important to look at the cause, and remedy of these evils. Until we are born of the Spirit, no spiritually good thing dwells in us, or can proceed from us. Even the little good in the regenerate is defiled with sin. We should therefore humble ourselves before God, and cast ourselves wholly on the mercy of God, through our Divine Surety. We should daily seek the renewing of the Holy Ghost, and look to heaven as the only place of perfect holiness and happiness.</body></html>
