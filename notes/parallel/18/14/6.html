Job now proceeds to enlarge on the mortality of man, comparing him, as is so often done in all literature, to the vegetable produce of the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-7.htm" title="The grass wither, the flower fades: because the spirit of the LORD blows on it: surely the people is grass.">Isaiah 40:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-22.htm" title="They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.">Isaiah 65:22</a>); with this difference, however--that a tree will sprout again when it is cut down, but even a strong man succumbs to death. "Yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Turn from him, that he may rest</span>; literally, <span class="accented">look away from him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Cease to watch him and search him out so continually" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-17.htm">Job 7:17, 18</a>). "Then he will be able to have a breathing-time, an interval of peace and rest, before his departure from the earth." What Job had previously desired for himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-20.htm">Job 10:20</a>) he now asks for all humanity. <span class="cmt_word">Till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day</span>. Hired labourers are glad when their day's work is over. So man rejoices when life comes to an end. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down</span>. God's vegetable creation is better off, in respect of length of days, than man. Let a tree be cut down, it is not therefore of necessity destroyed. There is yet hope for it. The bare dry stump will sometimes put forth tender branches, which will grow and flourish, and renew the old life. Or, if the stump be quite dead, suckers may spring up from the root and grow into new trees as vigorous as the one that they replace (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>). Herodotus considered that all trees had this recuperative power, except the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, a species of fir (Herod., 6:37), and the traveller Shaw says that when a palm tree dies there is always a sucker ready to take its place. Pliny also observes of the laurel, "Viva-cissima est radix, ita ut, si truncus ina-ruerit, recisa arbor mox laetius frutificet" ('Hist. Nat.,' 1:15. &sect; 30). <span class="cmt_word">That it will sprout again</span>. That is, from the spool or stump. Some trees, as the Spanish chest. nut, if cut down flush with the ground, throw up shoots from the entire circle of the stomp, often as many as fifteen or twenty. <span class="cmt_word">And that the tender branch thereof will not cease</span>. The vigour of such shoots is very great. In a few years they grow to the height of the parent tree. If they are then removed they are quickly replaced by a fresh growth. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-6 Job enlarges upon the condition of man, addressing himself also to God. Every man of Adam's fallen race is short-lived. All his show of beauty, happiness, and splendour falls before the stroke of sickness or death, as the flower before the scythe; or passes away like the shadow. How is it possible for a man's conduct to be sinless, when his heart is by nature unclean? Here is a clear proof that Job understood and believed the doctrine of original sin. He seems to have intended it as a plea, why the Lord should not deal with him according to his own works, but according to His mercy and grace. It is determined, in the counsel and decree of God, how long we shall live. Our times are in his hands, the powers of nature act under him; in him we live and move. And it is very useful to reflect seriously on the shortness and uncertainty of human life, and the fading nature of all earthly enjoyments. But it is still more important to look at the cause, and remedy of these evils. Until we are born of the Spirit, no spiritually good thing dwells in us, or can proceed from us. Even the little good in the regenerate is defiled with sin. We should therefore humble ourselves before God, and cast ourselves wholly on the mercy of God, through our Divine Surety. We should daily seek the renewing of the Holy Ghost, and look to heaven as the only place of perfect holiness and happiness.</body></html>
