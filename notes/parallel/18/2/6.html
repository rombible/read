Again it is strongly marked that Satan's power is under God's control, and extends only so far as God shows. <span class="cmt_word">But save his life</span>; rather, <span class="accented">only spare his life</span> (Revised Version). The didactic purposes for which God was allowing his faithful servant to be tried in the furnace of affliction would have been frustrated by Job's removal from the earth. Individually he might equally well have been compensated in another world; but then the lesson of his example to living men, and the lesson of his story to all future generations of mankind, would have been lost. Besides, God but rarely, in the old world, gave a faithful servant, still in the full vigour of life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-16.htm">Job 42:16, 17</a>), "over unto death" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-18.htm">Psalm 118:18</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-6. How well is it for us, that neither men nor devils are to be our judges! but all our judgment comes from the Lord, who never errs. Job holds fast his integrity still, as his weapon. God speaks with pleasure of the power of his own grace. Self-love and self-preservation are powerful in the hearts of men. But Satan accuses Job, representing him as wholly selfish, and minding nothing but his own ease and safety. Thus are the ways and people of God often falsely blamed by the devil and his agents. Permission is granted to Satan to make trial, but with a limit. If God did not chain up the roaring lion, how soon would he devour us! Job, thus slandered by Satan, was a type of Christ, the first prophecy of whom was, that Satan should bruise his heel, and be foiled.</body></html>
