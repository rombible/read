"The surface of the integuments," says Dr. Quain, "is often much inflamed, and sometimes discharges a serous ichor, or chyle-like fluid, according to the extent to which the lymphatics are engaged in the particular ease" (ibid., p. 432). This "serous or lymph-like fluid" is occasionally "acrid and offensive." Job seems to have used his potsherd to scrape it away<span class="cmt_word">. And he sat down among the ashes.</span> Not as a curative process, or even as an alleviation of his pains, but simply as was the custom of mourners (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-3.htm">Isaiah 47:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-5.htm">Isaiah 58:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-26.htm">Jeremiah 6:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-30.htm">Ezekiel 27:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a>). The LXX. renders, "on the dung-heap;" but this meaning, if a possible one, is highly improbable. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:7-10 The devil tempts his own children, and draws them to sin, and afterwards torments, when he has brought them to ruin; but this child of God he tormented with affliction, and then tempted to make a bad use of his affliction. He provoked Job to curse God. The disease was very grievous. If at any time we are tried with sore and grievous distempers, let us not think ourselves dealt with otherwise than as God sometimes deals with the best of his saints and servants. Job humbled himself under the mighty hand of God, and brought his mind to his condition. His wife was spared to him, to be a troubler and tempter to him. Satan still endeavours to draw men from God, as he did our first parents, by suggesting hard thoughts of Him, than which nothing is more false. But Job resisted and overcame the temptation. Shall we, guilty, polluted, worthless creatures, receive so many unmerited blessings from a just and holy God, and shall we refuse to accept the punishment of our sins, when we suffer so much less than we deserve? Let murmuring, as well as boasting, be for ever done away. Thus far Job stood the trial, and appeared brightest in the furnace of affliction. There might be risings of corruption in his heart, but grace had the upper hand.</body></html>
