The rest of the verse is additional, having reference to the conduct of Job under his earlier trials (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20-22</a>). And still he holdeth fast his integrity. This has been justly called "the key-note of the whole book" (Cook). Satan had declared that Job's integrity rested on no solid basis, and would easily be overthrown and disappear. God, confident in his servant's faithfulness and truth, had allowed him to assail it. What was the result? God declares it with his own mouth. Job's "integrity" had not been wrested from him; he still maintained it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21, 22</a>), as he was about to do till the end (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-1.htm">Job 42:1-6</a>). Compare the ideal "just man" of Horace - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">Justum et tenacem propositi virum<br />Non civium ardor prava jubentium,<br />Non vultus instantis tyranny<br />Menta quatit solida, neque Anster,<br />Dux inquieti turbidus Hadriae ....<br />Si fractus illabatur orbis,<br />Impavidum ferient ruinae."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Od.,' 3:3.</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Although thou movedst me against him</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-9.htm">Job 1:9-11</a>), <span class="cmt_word">to destroy him</span>; literally, to <span class="accented">swallow him up</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to ruin him, overwhelm him with calamities. <span class="cmt_word">Without cause</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "when he had done nothing to deserve such treatment." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-6. How well is it for us, that neither men nor devils are to be our judges! but all our judgment comes from the Lord, who never errs. Job holds fast his integrity still, as his weapon. God speaks with pleasure of the power of his own grace. Self-love and self-preservation are powerful in the hearts of men. But Satan accuses Job, representing him as wholly selfish, and minding nothing but his own ease and safety. Thus are the ways and people of God often falsely blamed by the devil and his agents. Permission is granted to Satan to make trial, but with a limit. If God did not chain up the roaring lion, how soon would he devour us! Job, thus slandered by Satan, was a type of Christ, the first prophecy of whom was, that Satan should bruise his heel, and be foiled.</body></html>
