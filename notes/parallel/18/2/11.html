and Bashemath bore Reuel;">Genesis 36:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/36-10.htm" title="These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.">Genesis 36:10-11</a>). If so, this may roughly indicate the date of the book. The inhabitants of Teman, which lay north-east of Edom, were famed for their wisdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-7.htm" title="How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD has given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there has he appointed it.">Jeremiah 47:7</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Bildad the Shuhite </span>probably derived his origin from Shuah, the son of Abraham by Keturah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-2.htm" title="And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.">Genesis 25:2</a>). Of the district from which Zophar the Naamathite came nothing is known. It probably derived its name from a Naamah or Naaman, of which there were several (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-22.htm" title="And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.">Genesis 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-21.htm" title="And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah.

It is not to be supposed that Job had no more than three friends - indeed, Elihu the Buzzite appears later on as one of his friends (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-2.htm">Job 32:2-6</a>) - but he had three contemporaries with whom he was especially intimate, old men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-6.htm">Job 32:6</a>), with whom he was probably accustomed to confer from time to time, and who were in the habit of giving him their advice. All three, apparently, lived at a distance; and it seems to have been some weeks before the news of his misfortunes reached them. When the news came they held communication one with another, and agreed to pay him visits of condolence at a certain definite time, which was determined upon between them. Some months - at least two - seem to have elapsed between the date of Job's latest affliction and the time of their arrival (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-3.htm">Job 7:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They came every one from his own place</span>. They had separate homes, and probably lived at some considerable distance from one another. Eliphaz the Temanite. There was an Eliphaz, the son of Esau by his wife Adah, who had a son Teman (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-4.htm">Genesis 36:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-35.htm">1 Chronicles 1:35, 36</a>); but it is not supposed that this can be the person here intended. The name Teman did not become geographical until the descendants of this Eliphaz's son had multiplied into a tribe, when they gave name to the portion of Arabia which they inhabited. This tract seems to have been either a part of Edom, or in its immediate vicinity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-42.htm">Genesis 36:42, 43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7, 8, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-15.htm">Ezekiel 25:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-8.htm">Obadiah 1:8, 9</a>), but cannot be located with accuracy. The Temanitee were celebrated for their wisdom, as we learn from Jeremiah, who says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7</a>), "Concerning Edom, thus saith the Lord of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?" Job's friend was probably among their wisest men at the time; and his discourses certainly show a considerable knowledge of human nature. They do not, however, solve the riddle of the universe. <span class="cmt_word">And Bildad the Shuhite</span>. Bildad is a name which does not occur elsewhere in Scripture, neither is there any other mention of Shuhites. Conjecture has identified the Shuhites with the Saccaei of Ptolemy ('Geograph.,' 5:15), whom he places in the neighbourhood of Batanaea and Trachonitis. But the Saccaei are unheard of till Ptolemy's time, and seem to be a tribe of very small importance. Perhaps Bildad belonged to the people known to the Assyrians as the Tsukhi, or Sukhi ('Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 14), who dwelt on the Middle Euphrates from about Anah to Hit ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 66, 67). <span class="cmt_word">And Zophar the Naamathite</span>. Zophar, or rather Tsophar, is another unknown name. There was a Naamah, a city, in south-western Judaea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-41.htm">Joshua 15:41</a>), to which Zophar may have belonged, though probably a region, rather than a city, is here intended. <span class="cmt_word">For they had made an appointment together</span>; or, <span class="accented">agreed together</span>, by message or letter probably. <span class="cmt_word">To come to mourn with him and to comfort him</span>. A good intention, at any rate, and one agreeable to the apostolic injunction to us to "weep with them that weep" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>). That they failed to carry out their intention (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-2.htm">Job 16:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-34.htm">Job 21:34</a>) was owing to a want of judgment, and, perhaps, in part, to a want of love. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:11-13 The friends of Job seem noted for their rank, as well as for wisdom and piety. Much of the comfort of this life lies in friendship with the prudent and virtuous. Coming to mourn with him, they vented grief which they really felt. Coming to comfort him, they sat down with him. It would appear that they suspected his unexampled troubles were judgments for some crimes, which he had vailed under his professions of godliness. Many look upon it only as a compliment to visit their friends in sorrow; we must look life. And if the example of Job's friends is not enough to lead us to pity the afflicted, let us seek the mind that was in Christ.</body></html>
