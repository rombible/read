It consists of three parts. Vers. 1-6 contain an account of Satan's second appearance in the courts of heaven, and of a second colloquy between him and the Almighty. Vers. 7-10 contain the sequel to this colloquy, viz. Satan's further affliction of Job, and his conduct under it. Vers. 11-13 contain an account of the arrival of Job's three special friends to mourn with him and to comfort him; and of their behavior during the first seven days after their arrival <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Again there was a day when the sons of God same to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them</span>. There is no "again" in the original. The words used are an exact repetition of those contained in ver. 6 of ch. 1. But they mark, no doubt, a <span class="accented">second</span> occasion on which the angelic host came to present themselves before the throne of God, and Satan came with them. <span class="cmt_word">To present himself before the Lord</span>. These words are additional to those used in the former passage. We may gather from them, that, whereas on the former occasion Satan came only to observe, and with no intention of drawing God's special attention to himself, he now had such intention, and looked forward to a colloquy. He anticipated, doubtless, that the circumstances of Job's probation would be referred to, and he had prepared himself to make answer. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-6. How well is it for us, that neither men nor devils are to be our judges! but all our judgment comes from the Lord, who never errs. Job holds fast his integrity still, as his weapon. God speaks with pleasure of the power of his own grace. Self-love and self-preservation are powerful in the hearts of men. But Satan accuses Job, representing him as wholly selfish, and minding nothing but his own ease and safety. Thus are the ways and people of God often falsely blamed by the devil and his agents. Permission is granted to Satan to make trial, but with a limit. If God did not chain up the roaring lion, how soon would he devour us! Job, thus slandered by Satan, was a type of Christ, the first prophecy of whom was, that Satan should bruise his heel, and be foiled.</body></html>
