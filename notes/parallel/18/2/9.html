Now she can endure no longer. To see her husband so afflicted, and so patient under his afflictions, is more than she can bear. Her mind is weak and ill regulated, and she suffers herself to become Satan's ally and her husband's worst enemy. It is noticeable that she urges her husband to do exactly that which Satan had suggested that he would do (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-11.htm">Job 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-5.htm">Job 2:5</a>), and had evidently wished him to do, thus fighting on his side, and increasing her husband's difficulties The only other mention of her (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-17.htm">Job 19:17</a>) implies that she was rather a hindrance than a help to Job. <span class="cmt_word">Curse God, and die</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "renounce God, put all regard for him away from thee, even though he kill thee for so doing." Job's wife implies that death is preferable to such a life as Job now leads and must expect to lead henceforward. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:7-10 The devil tempts his own children, and draws them to sin, and afterwards torments, when he has brought them to ruin; but this child of God he tormented with affliction, and then tempted to make a bad use of his affliction. He provoked Job to curse God. The disease was very grievous. If at any time we are tried with sore and grievous distempers, let us not think ourselves dealt with otherwise than as God sometimes deals with the best of his saints and servants. Job humbled himself under the mighty hand of God, and brought his mind to his condition. His wife was spared to him, to be a troubler and tempter to him. Satan still endeavours to draw men from God, as he did our first parents, by suggesting hard thoughts of Him, than which nothing is more false. But Job resisted and overcame the temptation. Shall we, guilty, polluted, worthless creatures, receive so many unmerited blessings from a just and holy God, and shall we refuse to accept the punishment of our sins, when we suffer so much less than we deserve? Let murmuring, as well as boasting, be for ever done away. Thus far Job stood the trial, and appeared brightest in the furnace of affliction. There might be risings of corruption in his heart, but grace had the upper hand.</body></html>
