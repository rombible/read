for merely to receive evil as from <span class= "ital">God's </span>hands is to transmute its character altogether, for then even calamities become blessings in disguise. What Job meant was that we are <span class= "ital">bound </span>to expect evil as well as good from God's hands by a sort of compensation and even-handed justice, but what his words <span class= "ital">may </span>mean is a far more blessed truth than this. There is a sublime contrast between the temptation of Job and the temptation of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/26-39.htm" title="And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as you will.">Matthew 26:39-42</a>, &c.). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-8.htm" title="Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;">Hebrews 5:8</a>.) <span class= "ital">This </span>was the lesson Job was learning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh</span>; rather, as <span class="accented">one of</span> <span class="accented">the vile</span> (or <span class="accented">impious</span>) <span class="accented">women speaketh. Nabal</span>, the term used, is expressive, not of mere natural folly, but of that perversion of the intellect which comes on men when their hearts and understandings are corrupted and degraded.. (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-13.htm">2 Samuel 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-6.htm">Isaiah 32:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">What? shall we receive good at the hand of God and shall we not receive evil?</span> Job remembers all the good which he has received of God during his past life, all the blessings and prosperity bestowed on him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-2.htm">Job 1:2, 3</a>), and asks - Would it be fair or right to take all the good things as a matter of course, and then to murmur if evil things are sent? He accepts both prosperity and affliction as coming from God, and expresses himself as willing to submit to his will. But he has, perhaps, scarcely attained to the conviction that whatever God sends to his faithful servants is always that which is best for them - that afflictions, in fact, are blessings in disguise, and ought to be received with gratitude, not with murmuring (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-11</a><span class="cmt_word">). In all this did not Job sin with his lips</span>. Thus far, that is, Job "kept the door of his mouth" strictly, righteously, piously. Later on he was not always so entirely free from fault. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:7-10 The devil tempts his own children, and draws them to sin, and afterwards torments, when he has brought them to ruin; but this child of God he tormented with affliction, and then tempted to make a bad use of his affliction. He provoked Job to curse God. The disease was very grievous. If at any time we are tried with sore and grievous distempers, let us not think ourselves dealt with otherwise than as God sometimes deals with the best of his saints and servants. Job humbled himself under the mighty hand of God, and brought his mind to his condition. His wife was spared to him, to be a troubler and tempter to him. Satan still endeavours to draw men from God, as he did our first parents, by suggesting hard thoughts of Him, than which nothing is more false. But Job resisted and overcame the temptation. Shall we, guilty, polluted, worthless creatures, receive so many unmerited blessings from a just and holy God, and shall we refuse to accept the punishment of our sins, when we suffer so much less than we deserve? Let murmuring, as well as boasting, be for ever done away. Thus far Job stood the trial, and appeared brightest in the furnace of affliction. There might be risings of corruption in his heart, but grace had the upper hand.</body></html>
