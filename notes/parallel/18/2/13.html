Professor Lee supposes that this is not to be taken literally. "It means" he says, "that they sat with him a considerable length of time before they opened the question discussed in this book, not that they sat precisely seven days and seven nights, and said not so much as one word to him" ('The Book of the Patriarch Job; p. 194). But the period of" seven days" was appropriate to mournings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-10.htm">Genesis 1:10</a> 2Samuel 31:13 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-15.htm">Ezekiel 3:15</a>), and if they could stay with him one day and one night without speaking, why not seven? Food would be brought them, and they might sleep rolled up in their <span class="accented">begeds</span>. The long silence may be accounted for by the fact that "among the Jews," and among Orientals generally, "it is a point of decorum, and one dictated by a fine and true feeling, not to speak to a person in deep affliction until he gives an intimation of a desire to be comforted" (Cook). So long as Job kept silence they had to keep silence, at least so far as he was concerned. They might speak to any attendants who drew near, and they might speak one to another. Note the words which follow: <span class="cmt_word">And none spake a word unto him</span> None spake <span class="accented">to him</span>; but no etiquette imposed complete silence on them. <span class="cmt_word">For they saw that his grief was very great</span>. So great that he could not as yet bear to be spoken to. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:11-13 The friends of Job seem noted for their rank, as well as for wisdom and piety. Much of the comfort of this life lies in friendship with the prudent and virtuous. Coming to mourn with him, they vented grief which they really felt. Coming to comfort him, they sat down with him. It would appear that they suspected his unexampled troubles were judgments for some crimes, which he had vailed under his professions of godliness. Many look upon it only as a compliment to visit their friends in sorrow; we must look life. And if the example of Job's friends is not enough to lead us to pity the afflicted, let us seek the mind that was in Christ.</body></html>
