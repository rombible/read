The same word means, indeed, to <span class= "ital">dig </span>and to <span class= "ital">blush; </span>but both meanings are incongruous and inadmissible here.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope</span>. Job, entering on this second period of prosperity, would be and feel secure; safe, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from any return of calamity, because hope would once more animate him and be his predominant feeling. No doubt "hope springs eternal in the human breast;" and when Job's prosperity was actually restored (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-12.htm">Job 42:12-16</a>), these anticipations had their fulfilment; but, as uttered by Zophar, there is a ring of insincerity about them, and we cannot but feel that his object in expatiating at length on the details of Job's coming happiness is not to console and encourage his friend, but rather to annoy and exasperate him, since the entire basis on which he builds is the assumption of Job's heinous guilt (vers. 3, 6, 11, 14), and the prosperity which he promises is to follow upon an acknowledgment of guilt and a putting sway of iniquity (vers. 13, 14), which he knew that Job wholly repudiated<span class="cmt_word">. Yea, thou shalt dig about thee</span>. So Schultens, who understands it to mean that Job shall dig a moat around his habitation, to make himself perfectly secure. The verb has, however, two other meanings - "to investigate" or "search out," and "to blush;" and it is taken here in each of these meanings by some critics. Our Revisers translate, "Yea, thou shalt search about thee;" and so Canon Cook and Professor Stanley Loathes. Rosenmuller, on the other hand, and Professor Lee render the words by "Though thou shouldst blush," or "be ashamed." It is difficult to decide between such high authorities; but the fast that Job uses the verb in the sense of "search," "look after," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-29.htm">Job 39:29</a>, and does not elsewhere use it in either of the other senses, should incline us to accept the rendering of the Revised Version. <span class="cmt_word">And thou shalt take thy rest in safety</span>; or, <span class="accented">securely</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with a sense of being in perfect security. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:13-20 Zophar exhorts Job to repentance, and gives him encouragement, yet mixed with hard thoughts of him. He thought that worldly prosperity was always the lot of the righteous, and that Job was to be deemed a hypocrite unless his prosperity was restored. Then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; that is, thou mayst come boldly to the throne of grace, and not with the terror and amazement expressed in ch. 9:34. If we are looked upon in the face of the Anointed, our faces that were cast down may be lifted up; though polluted, being now washed with the blood of Christ, they may be lifted up without spot. We may draw near in full assurance of faith, when we are sprinkled from an evil conscience, Heb 10:22.</body></html>
