Zophar probably refers to such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-20.htm">Job 9:20, 35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-7.htm">Job 10:7, 15</a>, where Job might seem to have justified himself altogether. And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed I It is not quite easy to see what in Job's speeches up to this point could be regarded as "mocking." But perhaps Zophar would have thus characterized the following passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-13.htm">Job 6:13, 14, 25-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-12.htm">Job 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22-24</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-6 Zophar attacked Job with great vehemence. He represented him as a man that loved to hear himself speak, though he could say nothing to the purpose, and as a man that maintained falsehoods. He desired God would show Job that less punishment was exacted than he deserved. We are ready, with much assurance, to call God to act in our quarrels, and to think that if he would but speak, he would take our part. We ought to leave all disputes to the judgment of God, which we are sure is according to truth; but those are not always right who are most forward to appeal to the Divine judgment.</body></html>
