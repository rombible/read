Zophar assumes this to be probable, nay, almost certain. He has already told Job that God has exacted from him less than his iniquity (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, the same word) deserves (ver. 6). Conformably with this view, he now suggests that it would not do for Job to stretch out to God in prayer a hand full of iniquity, and that therefore, previously to making his supplication, he would do well to lay his iniquity aside. In a general way, the advice is excellent; but it was insulting to Job, who denied that he had any definite act of sin on his conscience. <span class="cmt_word">Put it far away</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> repent of it, confess it to God; if the case admits of it, make reparation or restitution. <span class="cmt_word">And let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles</span>; or, in thy tents. The insinuation seems to be that Job is a robber chief, and that his tent and the tents of his followers are full of ill-gotten spoils, the fruit of his raids upon the defenceless. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:13-20 Zophar exhorts Job to repentance, and gives him encouragement, yet mixed with hard thoughts of him. He thought that worldly prosperity was always the lot of the righteous, and that Job was to be deemed a hypocrite unless his prosperity was restored. Then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; that is, thou mayst come boldly to the throne of grace, and not with the terror and amazement expressed in ch. 9:34. If we are looked upon in the face of the Anointed, our faces that were cast down may be lifted up; though polluted, being now washed with the blood of Christ, they may be lifted up without spot. We may draw near in full assurance of faith, when we are sprinkled from an evil conscience, Heb 10:22.</body></html>
