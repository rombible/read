The first seems most to be preferred, for at all events Job had hypothetically spoken of himself as righteous before God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-15.htm" title="If I be wicked, woe to me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see you my affliction;">Job 10:15</a>). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-30.htm" title="If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;">Job 9:30</a>. &c.) Zophar, therefore, who professes superior wisdom, desires that God would show Job how far short he falls of it: that He would show him the hidden things, the secrets of wisdom; for sound wisdom is manifold: it has many aspects, and lies as it were fold over fold in unexpected complexities, defying the shallow and unscrutinising gaze; and were He to do this, Job would find out to his dismay that God still credited him part of the penalty due to him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure</span>. Job had certainly not said this in so many words. In fact, he had not spoken of his "doctrine" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5e7;&#x5d7;</span>), nor had he called either his doctrine or his conduct absolutely pure (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;</span>). But, no doubt, he had maintained, in a certain sense, his innocency; not, indeed, his entire freedom from sin or guilt, but his honest endeavour to serve God and lead a good life. This was the real point disputed between him and his "comforters;" they argued, from his sufferings, that he must be a "chief sinner;" he maintained, from the testimony of his conscience, that he was free from all heinous sins<span class="cmt_word">. And I am clean in thine eyes</span> (see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-30.htm">Job 9:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-7.htm">Job 10:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-6 Zophar attacked Job with great vehemence. He represented him as a man that loved to hear himself speak, though he could say nothing to the purpose, and as a man that maintained falsehoods. He desired God would show Job that less punishment was exacted than he deserved. We are ready, with much assurance, to call God to act in our quarrels, and to think that if he would but speak, he would take our part. We ought to leave all disputes to the judgment of God, which we are sure is according to truth; but those are not always right who are most forward to appeal to the Divine judgment.</body></html>
