This is how we understand the word rendered <span class= "ital">thou shalt shine forth. </span>Many take it as a substantive, meaning <span class= "ital">darkness, </span>in which case we must render, <span class= "ital">though there be darkness, thou shalt be as the morning.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday</span>; literally, <span class="accented">shall arise above the noonday</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "exceed it in splendour." Instead of the "thick darkness" to which Job is looking forward (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21, 22</a>), he shall bask in a light brighter than that of the sun at noon. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt shine forth</span>. The Hebrew cannot possibly bear this meaning. The uncommon word used is allied with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "obscurity," and, if a verb, should mean "thou shalt be obscure," rather than "thou shalt shine forth." But it is perhaps a substantive, meaning "darkness;" and the translation of the Revised Version is perhaps correct: "Though there be darkness." Thou shalt be as the morning. "Thy light," as Professor Lee explains, "shall gradually rise and expand itself far and wide." It shall dispel the darkness, and take its place," shining more and more unto the perfect day" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:13-20 Zophar exhorts Job to repentance, and gives him encouragement, yet mixed with hard thoughts of him. He thought that worldly prosperity was always the lot of the righteous, and that Job was to be deemed a hypocrite unless his prosperity was restored. Then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; that is, thou mayst come boldly to the throne of grace, and not with the terror and amazement expressed in ch. 9:34. If we are looked upon in the face of the Anointed, our faces that were cast down may be lifted up; though polluted, being now washed with the blood of Christ, they may be lifted up without spot. We may draw near in full assurance of faith, when we are sprinkled from an evil conscience, Heb 10:22.</body></html>
