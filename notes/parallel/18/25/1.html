God, he says, is almighty, infinite, and absolute. How can any man contend with Him, or claim to be pure in His sight? This is the final speech of the friends. Bildad no longer accuses Job; he practically owns himself and his companions worsted in argument, seeing that he attempts no reply, but reiterates truisms that are independent of the special matter in hand. Job, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/23-3.htm" title="Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!">Job 23:3-12</a>, had spoken of his longing for the Divine judgment; so Bildad labours to deprive him of that confidence, as though he would say, "I have nothing to do with your facts, nor can I explain them; but be that as it may, I am certain that you, or any mortal man, cannot be pure in the sight of God."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - Far from accepting Job's challenge, and grappling with the difficulty involved in the frequent, if not universal, prosperity of the wicked. Bildad, in his weak reply, entirely avoids the subject, and limits himself to briefly touching two old and well-worn topics - the might of God (vers. 2, 3) and the universal sinfulness of men. On neither of these two points does he throw any fresh light. He avoids, however, the reckless charges of Eliphaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-5.htm">Job 22:5-9</a>) as well as the coarse menaces of Zophar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-5.htm">Job 20:5-29</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, Dominion and fear are with him</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> with God). God is the absolute Sovereign of the universe, to whom, therefore, all created beings must perforce submit themselves. He is also terrible in his might, so that for their own sakes men should submit to his decrees. Through his active sovereignty, and the fear which he inspires, <span class="cmt_word">he maketh peace in his high places</span>. The meaning may be that, through these high attributes, God <span class="accented">maintains</span> peace among the dwellers in the supernal regions; but beyond this there is a possible allusion to a time in which peace was disturbed, and the Almighty had to "make" it, or re-establish it, (On the subject of the "war in heaven," and the defeat and subjection of the rebels, see the comment on Job 9:13.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-6 Bildad shows that man cannot be justified before God. - Bildad drops the question concerning the prosperity of wicked men; but shows the infinite distance there is between God and man. He represents to Job some truths he had too much overlooked. Man's righteousness and holiness, at the best, are nothing in comparison with God's, Ps 89:6. As God is so great and glorious, how can man, who is guilty and impure, appear before him? We need to be born again of water and of the Holy Ghost, and to be bathed again and again in the blood of Christ, that Fountain opened, Zec 13:1. We should be humbled as mean, guilty, polluted creatures, and renounce self-dependence. But our vileness will commend Christ's condescension and love; the riches of his mercy and the power of his grace will be magnified to all eternity by every sinner he redeems.</body></html>
