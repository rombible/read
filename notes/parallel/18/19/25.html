First, we must bear in mind that Bildad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/18-17.htm" title="His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.">Job 18:17-20</a>) had threatened Job with the extinction of his <span class= "ital">name and memory, </span>so he now appeals to the verdict of futurity, and with what success we ourselves who read and repeat and discuss his words are witnesses. Then in Job's own speeches we have, as early as <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/9-32.htm" title="For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.">Job 9:32-35</a>. his longing for <span class= "ital">a daysman </span>to come between himself and God. Then in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-7.htm" title="You know that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of your hand.">Job 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/13-15.htm" title="Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain my own ways before him.">Job 13:15-19</a>, he emphatically declares his innocence, and appeals to God as conscious of it. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-19.htm" title="Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.">Job 16:19</a>, he affirms that his <span class= "ital">witness is in the high heavens; </span>in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-21.htm" title="Have pity on me, have pity on me, O you my friends; for the hand of God has touched me.">Job 19:21</a> of the same chapter he longs for an <span class= "ital">advocate to plead his cause. </span>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-3.htm" title="Lay down now, put me in a surety with you; who is he that will strike hands with me?">Job 17:3</a> he calls upon God to <span class= "ital">be surety for him. </span>Therefore he has already recognised God as his <span class= "ital">judge, </span>his <span class= "ital">umpire, </span>his <span class= "ital">advocate, </span>his <span class= "ital">witness, </span>and <span class= "ital">surety, </span>and in some cases by formal confession of the fact, in others by earnest longing after and aspirations for some one to act in that capacity. Here, then, he goes a step further in expression, if not by implication, and declares his knowledge that he has a <span class= "ital">Goel </span>or Redeemer. This <span class= "ital">goel </span>was the name given to the next of kin whose duty it was to redeem, ransom, or avenge one who had fallen into debt or bondage, or had been slain in a family feud. In Ruth, for instance, the goel is he who has to marry the widow of his relative, and to continue his name. The various and conditional functions, then, of this <span class= "ital">Goel, </span>Job is assured, God will take upon Himself for him; He will avenge his quarrel (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-1.htm" title="Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.">Psalm 35:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-23.htm" title="Stir up yourself, and awake to my judgment, even to my cause, my God and my Lord.">Psalm 35:23</a>), He will be surety for him. He will vindicate him before men and before God Himself; He will do for him what none of his professed friends would undertake to do. And as to this matter, he has not the slightest doubt: he states most emphatically that he himself <span class= "ital">knows </span>that this <span class= "ital">Goel </span>liveth. "And I, even I know; as for me, I know that my Vindicator is living, that He liveth, is a reality existing now, and not one to come into existence hereafter, though His manifestation may be a thing of the future, for He shall stand at the last upon the earth," or, "He shall stand last upon earth" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-8.htm" title="The grass wither, the flower fades: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.">Isaiah 40:8</a>), that is, after all others have passed away and gone down to the bars of the tomb. Now, this alone is assuredly a marvellous confession. It states the reality and eternity of God. It is faith in the <span class= "ital">I am. </span>This same epithet of Redeemer is applied to God in Ps. 19:15; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-20.htm" title="And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and to them that turn from transgression in Jacob, said the LORD.">Isaiah 59:20</a>; in the former passage it is coupled with rock, which was the term Bildad bad applied to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-4.htm" title="He tears himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for you? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?">Job 18:4</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Upon the earth </span>is literally, <span class= "ital">upon dust; </span>the word is thus used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-33.htm" title="On earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.">Job 41:33</a>. This usage of the same words in the same book, where the meaning is not ambiguous, is strongly against the rendering some have preferred: <span class= "ital">over the dust, </span>or <span class= "ital">over my dust.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I know that my Redeemer liveth</span>. Numerous endeavours have been made to explain away the mysterious import of this verse. First, it is noted that a goel is any one who avenges or ransoms another, and especially that it is "the technical expression for the avenger of blood" (Froude, 'Short Stories,' vol. 1. p. 284) so often mentioned in the Old Testament. It is suggested, therefore, that Job's real meaning may be that he expects one of his relatives to arise after his death as the avenger of his blood, and to exact retribution for it. But unless in the case of a violent death at the hands of a man, which was not what Job expected for himself, there could be no avenger of blood. Job has already expressed his desire to have a <span class="accented">thirdsman</span> between him and God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-32.htm">Job 9:32-35</a>), which thirdsman can scarcely be other than a Divine Personage. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-19.htm">Job 16:19</a> be has declared his conviction that" his <span class="accented">Witness</span> is in heaven." In ver. 21 of the same chapter he longs to have an <span class="accented">advocate</span> to plead his cause with God. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a> he calls upon God to be <span class="accented">Surety</span> for him. Therefore, as Dr. Stanley Leathes points out, "he has already recognized God <span class="accented">as his Judge</span> his <span class="accented">Umpire</span> his <span class="accented">Advocate</span> his <span class="accented">Witness</span> and his <span class="accented">Surety</span> in some cases by formal confession of the fact, in others by earnest longing after, and aspiration for, some one to act in that capacity." After all this, it is not taking a very long step in advance to see and acknowledge in God his Goel, or "Redeemer." <span class="cmt_word">And that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and that at the last he shall stand up over my dust.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> is not "one who comes after me;" but, if a noun, "the last <span class="accented">one</span>" <span class="accented">as</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> is "the first one "(<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>); if intended adverbially, "at the last" - <span class="accented">i.e</span>, at the end of all things. "At the latter day" is not an improper translation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:23-29 The Spirit of God, at this time, seems to have powerfully wrought on the mind of Job. Here he witnessed a good confession; declared the soundness of his faith, and the assurance of his hope. Here is much of Christ and heaven; and he that said such things are these, declared plainly that he sought the better country, that is, the heavenly. Job was taught of God to believe in a living Redeemer; to look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come; he comforted himself with the expectation of these. Job was assured, that this Redeemer of sinners from the yoke of Satan and the condemnation of sin, was his Redeemer, and expected salvation through him; and that he was a living Redeemer, though not yet come in the flesh; and that at the last day he would appear as the Judge of the world, to raise the dead, and complete the redemption of his people. With what pleasure holy Job enlarges upon this! May these faithful sayings be engraved by the Holy Spirit upon our hearts. We are all concerned to see that the root of the matter be in us. A living, quickening, commanding principle of grace in the heart, is the root of the matter; as necessary to our religion as the root of the tree, to which it owes both its fixedness and its fruitfulness. Job and his friends differed concerning the methods of Providence, but they agreed in the root of the matter, the belief of another world.</body></html>
