It is not what has happened to him in the way of affliction and calamity that so much oppresses and crushes the patriarch, as the <span class="accented">cause to</span> which he, not unnaturally, ascribes his afflictions, vie. the wrath of God. Participating in the general creed of his time, he believes his sufferings to come direct from God, and to be proofs of God's severe anger against him. He is not, however, prepared on this account to renounce God. "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>) is still his inward sustaining thought and guiding principle. <span class="cmt_word">And he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies</span>. Job felt himself treated as an enemy of God, and supposed that God must consider him such. He either had no glimpse of the cheering truth, "Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>), or he could not imagine that such woes as his were mere chastenings. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:8-22 How doleful are Job's complaints! What is the fire of hell but the wrath of God! Seared consciences will feel it hereafter, but do not fear it now: enlightened consciences fear it now, but shall not feel it hereafter. It is a very common mistake to think that those whom God afflicts he treats as his enemies. Every creature is that to us which God makes it to be; yet this does not excuse Job's relations and friends. How uncertain is the friendship of men! but if God be our Friend, he will not fail us in time of need. What little reason we have to indulge the body, which, after all our care, is consumed by diseases it has in itself. Job recommends himself to the compassion of his friends, and justly blames their harshness. It is very distressing to one who loves God, to be bereaved at once of outward comfort and of inward consolation; yet if this, and more, come upon a believer, it does not weaken the proof of his being a child of God and heir of glory.</body></html>
