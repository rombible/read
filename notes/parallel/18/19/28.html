"For ye say, How we will persecute him, and that the root of the matter is found in me." The Authorised Version takes the other view. It seems preferable to render, "For ye say, What is a persecuted man to Him (why should He persecute any man without cause?), and therefore the root of the matter (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the cause of the afflictions) is, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>must be found in me."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But ye should say, Why persecute we him?</span> rather, <span class="accented">if ye shall say</span> <span class="accented">How shall we persecute him?</span> That is to say, "If, after what I have said, ye continue bitter against me, and take counsel together as to the best way of persecuting me, then, <span class="cmt_word">seeing the root of the matter</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the essence of piety) is found in me, be ye afraid," etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:23-29 The Spirit of God, at this time, seems to have powerfully wrought on the mind of Job. Here he witnessed a good confession; declared the soundness of his faith, and the assurance of his hope. Here is much of Christ and heaven; and he that said such things are these, declared plainly that he sought the better country, that is, the heavenly. Job was taught of God to believe in a living Redeemer; to look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come; he comforted himself with the expectation of these. Job was assured, that this Redeemer of sinners from the yoke of Satan and the condemnation of sin, was his Redeemer, and expected salvation through him; and that he was a living Redeemer, though not yet come in the flesh; and that at the last day he would appear as the Judge of the world, to raise the dead, and complete the redemption of his people. With what pleasure holy Job enlarges upon this! May these faithful sayings be engraved by the Holy Spirit upon our hearts. We are all concerned to see that the root of the matter be in us. A living, quickening, commanding principle of grace in the heart, is the root of the matter; as necessary to our religion as the root of the tree, to which it owes both its fixedness and its fruitfulness. Job and his friends differed concerning the methods of Providence, but they agreed in the root of the matter, the belief of another world.</body></html>
