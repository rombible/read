(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-20.htm" title="My friends scorn me: but my eye pours out tears to God.">Job 16:20</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O my friends</span>. On the enumeration of his various woes, Job's appeal for pity follows. We must not regard it as addressed merely to the three so-called "friends" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>) or "comforters" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-2.htm">Job 16:2</a>), Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. It is an appeal to all those who are around him and about him, whose sympathies have been bither to estranged (vers. 13-19), but whose regard he does not despair of winning back. Will they not, when they perceive the extremity and variety of his sufferings, be moved to compassion by them, and commiserate him in his day of calamity? <span class="cmt_word">For the hand of God hath touched me</span>. To the "comforters" this is no argument. They deem him unworthy of pity on the very ground that he is "smitten of God, and afflicted" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>); since they hold that, being so smitten, he must have' deserved his calamity. But to unprejudiced persons, not wedded to a theory, such an aggravation of his woe would naturally seem to render him a greater object of pity and compassion. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:8-22 How doleful are Job's complaints! What is the fire of hell but the wrath of God! Seared consciences will feel it hereafter, but do not fear it now: enlightened consciences fear it now, but shall not feel it hereafter. It is a very common mistake to think that those whom God afflicts he treats as his enemies. Every creature is that to us which God makes it to be; yet this does not excuse Job's relations and friends. How uncertain is the friendship of men! but if God be our Friend, he will not fail us in time of need. What little reason we have to indulge the body, which, after all our care, is consumed by diseases it has in itself. Job recommends himself to the compassion of his friends, and justly blames their harshness. It is very distressing to one who loves God, to be bereaved at once of outward comfort and of inward consolation; yet if this, and more, come upon a believer, it does not weaken the proof of his being a child of God and heir of glory.</body></html>
