(So Rosenmuller, Canon Cook, and the Revised Version.) Others translate, "the vile," or "the perverse" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-11.htm">Job 16:11</a>). But the rendering of the Authorized Version receives support from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-11.htm">Job 21:11</a>. The forwardness of rude and ill-trained children to take part against God's saints appears later in the history of Elisha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-23.htm">2 Kings 2:23, 24</a>). I arose, and they spake against me; or, <span class="accented">when</span> I <span class="accented">arise</span> <span class="accented">they speak against me</span> (compare. the Revised Version). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:8-22 How doleful are Job's complaints! What is the fire of hell but the wrath of God! Seared consciences will feel it hereafter, but do not fear it now: enlightened consciences fear it now, but shall not feel it hereafter. It is a very common mistake to think that those whom God afflicts he treats as his enemies. Every creature is that to us which God makes it to be; yet this does not excuse Job's relations and friends. How uncertain is the friendship of men! but if God be our Friend, he will not fail us in time of need. What little reason we have to indulge the body, which, after all our care, is consumed by diseases it has in itself. Job recommends himself to the compassion of his friends, and justly blames their harshness. It is very distressing to one who loves God, to be bereaved at once of outward comfort and of inward consolation; yet if this, and more, come upon a believer, it does not weaken the proof of his being a child of God and heir of glory.</body></html>
