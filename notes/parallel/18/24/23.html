Some understand the subject of the first verb, "he giveth him to be in security," to be God, and that also makes very good sense, for while God so allows him to be secure, His eyes are on their ways, the ways of all of them. In this case, however, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-24.htm" title="They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.">Job 24:24</a> does not correspond so well with what Job has already said of the impunity with which the wicked are wicked, unless indeed the <span class= "ital">suddenness </span>of their fate is the main point of his remarks, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-19.htm" title="Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so does the grave those which have sinned.">Job 24:19</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">God</span>) <span class="accented">granteth him to be in security</span> <span class="accented">and thereon he resteth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> God allows the escape of the wicked man from his trouble, and lets him live on, safe and secure, and the man himself rests on the security thus afforded him, quite contented with it. Yet his eyes are upon their ways. God's eyes are still upon the ways of the wicked: they are, or seem to be, the objects of a special providential care. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:18-25 Sometimes how gradual is the decay, how quiet the departure of a wicked person, how is he honoured, and how soon are all his cruelties and oppressions forgotten! They are taken off with other men, as the harvestman gathers the ears of corn as they come to hand. There will often appear much to resemble the wrong view of Providence Job takes in this chapter. But we are taught by the word of inspiration, that these notions are formed in ignorance, from partial views. The providence of God, in the affairs of men, is in every thing a just and wise providence. Let us apply this whenever the Lord may try us. He cannot do wrong. The unequalled sorrows of the Son of God when on earth, unless looked at in this view, perplex the mind. But when we behold him, as the sinner's Surety, bearing the curse, we can explain why he should endure that wrath which was due to sin, that Divine justice might be satisfied, and his people saved.</body></html>
