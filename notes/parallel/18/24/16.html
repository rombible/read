In ancient times, burglary commonly took this form. Windows were few, and high up in the walls; doors were strongly fastened with bolts and bars. But the walls, being of clay, or rubble, or sun-dried brick, were weak and easily penetrable. This was especially the case with party walls; and if burglars entered an unoccupied house, nothing was easier than to break through the slight partition which separated it from the house next door. The Greek word for "burglar" is <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>" he who digs through a wall." <span class="cmt_word">Which they had marked for themselves in the daytime</span>; rather, they <span class="accented">shut themselves up in the daytime</span>; literally, <span class="accented">they seal themselves up</span>; the meaning being that they carefully keep themselves close. Professor Lee, however, defends the Authorized Version. They know not the light; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they avoid it, keep away from it, will have nothing to do with it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:13-17 See what care and pains wicked men take to compass their wicked designs; let it shame our negligence and slothfulness in doing good. See what pains those take, who make provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts of it: pains to compass, and then to hide that which will end in death and hell at last. Less pains would mortify and crucify the flesh, and be life and heaven at last. Shame came in with sin, and everlasting shame is at the end of it. See the misery of sinners; they are exposed to continual frights: yet see their folly; they are afraid of coming under the eye of men, but have no dread of God's eye, which is always upon them: they are not afraid of doing things which they are afraid of being known to do.</body></html>
