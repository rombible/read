"Why is it," he asks, "since times and events are not hidden from the Almighty, that they who know Him--that is, believe in and love Him--do not see His days?"--that is, His days of retribution and judgment. Even those who love and serve God are as perplexed about His principles of government as those who know Him not. It is to be observed that the position of the second negative in the Authorised Version of this verse renders it highly ambiguous to the majority of readers. This ambiguity would entirely disappear if we read <span class= "ital">see not </span>instead of "not see."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why, seeing times are not hidden from the almighty</span>. By "times" seem to be meant God's special periods of exhibiting himself in action as the moral Governor of the world, vindicating the righteous, and taking vengeance upon sinners. Such "times" are frequently spoken of in the prophetical Scriptures as "days of the Lord" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-18.htm">Isaiah 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-1.htm">Isaiah 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-15.htm">Obadiah 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7, 14</a>, etc.). They are, of course, "not hidden" from him, seeing that it is he who determines on them beforehand, and, when their fixed date is come, makes them special "days," or "times," different from all others. <span class="cmt_word">Do they who know him not see his days?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> why are even they, who know and serve God, kept in the dark as to these "times," so that they do not foresee them or know when they are coming? This is to Job a great perplexity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-12 Job discourses further about the prosperity of the wicked. That many live at ease who are ungodly and profane, he had showed, ch. xxi. Here he shows that many who live in open defiance of all the laws of justice, succeed in wicked practices; and we do not see them reckoned with in this world. He notices those that do wrong under pretence of law and authority; and robbers, those that do wrong by force. He says, God layeth not folly to them; that is, he does not at once send his judgments, nor make them examples, and so manifest their folly to all the world. But he that gets riches, and not by right, at his end shall be a fool, Jer 17:11.</body></html>
