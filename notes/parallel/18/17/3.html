This is virtually the same prayer that we find Hezekiah using (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-14.htm" title="Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: my eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.">Isaiah 38:14</a>): "O Lord, I am oppressed: <span class= "ital">undertake </span>for me," that is, "Be surety for me." (See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-122.htm" title="Be surety for your servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.">Psalm 119:122</a> : "Be surety for thy servant for good.") There is that in man which demands exact and rigorous fulfilment or expiation of non-fulfilment. Job felt that his only hope of this fulfilment or expiation of non-fulfilment lay with God Himself: that same God who had put this sense of obligation within him; therefore he says, Be surety for me with Thyself." He longed for the daysman who should lay his hand upon both him and God; he now longs for that surety with God that God alone can give. The surety must be Divine if his witness is in the heavens; it must be the witness of God to God himself. In this wonderful way does the language of Job fit in with all that we have since and elsewhere learnt of the persons in the Godhead.<p><span class= "bld">Who is he that will strike hands with me?</span>--This was the method of becoming surety; but he knows that there is no one among his friends who will do this, or that could do it if he would. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-7.htm" title="None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:">Psalm 49:7</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lay down now</span>; or, <span class="accented">give now a</span> pledge (see the Revised Version). The terms used in this verse are law terms. Job calls upon God to go into court with him, and, first of all, to deposit the caution-money which the court will require before it undertakes the investigation of the case. Next, he goes on to say, <span class="cmt_word">put me in a surety with thee</span>; or rather (as in the Revised Version), <span class="accented">be surety for me with thyself</span> which is either the same thing with giving a pledge, or a further legal requirement. Finally, he asks the question, <span class="cmt_word">Who is he that will strike hands with me?</span> meaning, "Who else is there but thyself, to whom I can look to be my surety, and by striking hands (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1</a>) with me to accept the legal responsibility?" As Dr. Stanley Leathes says, "It is wonderful the way in which the language of Job fits in with what we have since and elsewhere learnt concerning the Persons in the Godhead." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-9 Job reflects upon the harsh censures his friends had passed upon him, and, looking on himself as a dying man, he appeals to God. Our time is ending. It concerns us carefully to redeem the days of time, and to spend them in getting ready for eternity. We see the good use the righteous should make of Job's afflictions from God, from enemies, and from friends. Instead of being discouraged in the service of God, by the hard usage this faithful servant of God met with, they should be made bold to proceed and persevere therein. Those who keep their eye upon heaven as their end, will keep their feet in the paths of religion as their way, whatever difficulties and discouragements they may meet with.</body></html>
