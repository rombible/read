God, by the unprecedented character of his afflictions, has made Job a byword among the surrounding nations - a byword, that is, for an afflicted person. Job, by the manner in which he bore his afflictions, made himself a byword for patience and endurance among God's people throughout all ages (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">aforetime I was as a tabret</span>; rather, I <span class="accented">am become an abomination before them</span>; or, as our Revisers translate, 1 <span class="accented">am become an open abhorring</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-10.htm">Job 30:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-9 Job reflects upon the harsh censures his friends had passed upon him, and, looking on himself as a dying man, he appeals to God. Our time is ending. It concerns us carefully to redeem the days of time, and to spend them in getting ready for eternity. We see the good use the righteous should make of Job's afflictions from God, from enemies, and from friends. Instead of being discouraged in the service of God, by the hard usage this faithful servant of God met with, they should be made bold to proceed and persevere therein. Those who keep their eye upon heaven as their end, will keep their feet in the paths of religion as their way, whatever difficulties and discouragements they may meet with.</body></html>
