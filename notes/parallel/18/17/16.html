The difficulty consists in this: <span class= "ital">the bars of the grave </span>are masculine, and the verb, <span class= "ital">they shall go down, </span>is feminine plural; it seems improbable that <span class= "ital">the bars of the grave </span>should be the subject of the verb (though perhaps not absolutely impossible); but if <span class= "ital">the bars of the grave </span>are the place to which the going down is, as in the Authorised Version, then what is the subject to the verb, go down, seeing that <span class= "ital">hope, </span>the apparent subject, is a feminine singular? Some render "it shall go down," but this is in defiance of the grammar, though, probably, the meaning it conveys is not far from the truth. The words clearly express a condition of utter despair, and that Job's only hope of rest is in the grave. It is a rule in Hebrew grammar that when the verb precedes its subject it need not agree with it in gender or number; but here the verb must, at all events, come after its subject, and consequently, it is very difficult to determine what that subject is. The only apparent subject is to be found in the <span class= "ital">corruption </span>of the <span class= "ital">worm </span>of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-14.htm" title="I have said to corruption, You are my father: to the worm, You are my mother, and my sister.">Job 17:14</a>; but they, instead of going down to the grave, are already there.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust</span>. There is great difficulty in determining the subject to the verb "go down," which is the third person plural <span class="accented">feminine</span>, whereas the only plural substantive at all near - the word translated "bars" - is masculine. Some suppose Job's <span class="accented">hopes</span> to be meant, "hope" in the preceding verse having the force of any number of "hopes" (so the R.V.) Others disregard the grammatical difficulty of the plural <span class="accented">feminine</span> verb, and, making "bars" the nominative, translate, "The bars of Sheol shall go down," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "be broken down, perish;" or interrogatively, "Shall the bars of Sheol go down?" This rendering is thought to be "in harmony with the whole undercurrent of thought in the chapter;" but it has not approved itself to many commentators. The present commentator must acknowledge that he is unable to attach any satisfactory meaning to the words of the Hebrew text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:10-16 Job's friends had pretended to comfort him with the hope of his return to a prosperous estate; he here shows that those do not go wisely about the work of comforting the afflicted, who fetch their comforts from the possibility of recovery in this world. It is our wisdom to comfort ourselves, and others, in distress, with that which will not fail; the promise of God, his love and grace, and a well-grounded hope of eternal life. See how Job reconciles himself to the grave. Let this make believers willing to die; it is but going to bed; they are weary, and it is time that they were in their beds. Why should not they go willingly when their Father calls them? Let us remember our bodies are allied to corruption, the worm and the dust; and let us seek for that lively hope which shall be fulfilled, when the hope of the wicked shall be put out in darkness; that when our bodies are in the grave, our souls may enjoy the rest reserved for the people of God.</body></html>
