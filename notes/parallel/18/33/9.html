This shows that Elihu even was incapable of entering fully into Job's position. He did not understand that a man could alone be righteous in proportion as he trusted God, but that, trusting God, he was righteous with His righteousness. This was the truth that Job dimly perceived and was faintly, though surely, striving after; and to his friends it was unintelligible, and not wholly apprehended by Elihu.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am clean without transgression, I am innocent</span>. Job had not said that he was "clean," or "without transgression," or "innocent." With respect to "cleanness," he had observed, "Who can bring a <span class="accented">clean</span> thing out of an <span class="accented">unclean?</span> not one," implying that all men were unclean (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-4.htm">Job 14:4</a>). Concerning ,'transgressions," he had declared, "I have sinned... Why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-20.htm">Job 7:20, 21</a>); and again, "Thou makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-26.htm">Job 13:26</a>). Further, he had asked to be told the number of his iniquities and sins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-23.htm">Job 13:23</a>), and declared that God kept his transgressions and iniquities sewn up and sealed in a bag (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-17.htm">Job 14:17</a>). With regard to "innocence," the only observation that he had made was, "I know that thou wilt <span class="accented">not</span> hold me innocent" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-28.htm">Job 9:28</a>). What he had really asserted was his uprightness, his integrity, his "righteousness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-4.htm">Job 12:4</a>: 16:17; 23. 7; 27:5, 6; 31:5-40). And these are exactly what God bore witness to (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-8.htm">Job 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-3.htm">Job 2:3</a>). It is plain, then, that Elihu overstated his ease, and, whatever his intentions were, was practically almost as unfair to Job as the "comforters." Neither is there iniquity in me. Nor had Job said this. He had frequently acknowledged the contrary (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-21.htm">Job 7:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-26.htm">Job 13:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-17.htm">Job 14:17</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:8-13 Elihu charges Job with reflecting upon the justice and goodness of God. When we hear any thing said to God's dishonour, we ought to bear our testimony against it. Job had represented God as severe in marking what he did amiss. Elihu urges that he had spoken wrong, and that he ought to humble himself before God, and by repentance to unsay it. God is not accountable to us. It is unreasonable for weak, sinful creatures, to strive with a God of infinite wisdom, power, and goodness. He acts with perfect justice, wisdom, and goodness, where we cannot perceive it.</body></html>
