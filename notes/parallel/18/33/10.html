This charge may perhaps be justified by reference to Job's complaints in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-17.htm">Job 7:17-19</a> and Job 10:3-6; but the exact words are not Job's. <span class="cmt_word">He counteth me for his enemy</span>. Certainly, Job had <span class="accented">said</span> this more than ones (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-9.htm">Job 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19.htm">Job 19</a>. l 1). But he cannot really have believed it, or his trust in God must have failed. The fact that to the last he clung to God, appealed to him, hoped to receive judgment from him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-2.htm">Job 31:2, 6, 28, 35-37</a>), is proof sufficient that he knew God was not really alienated from him, but would in the end acknowledge him and vindicate his character. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:8-13 Elihu charges Job with reflecting upon the justice and goodness of God. When we hear any thing said to God's dishonour, we ought to bear our testimony against it. Job had represented God as severe in marking what he did amiss. Elihu urges that he had spoken wrong, and that he ought to humble himself before God, and by repentance to unsay it. God is not accountable to us. It is unreasonable for weak, sinful creatures, to strive with a God of infinite wisdom, power, and goodness. He acts with perfect justice, wisdom, and goodness, where we cannot perceive it.</body></html>
