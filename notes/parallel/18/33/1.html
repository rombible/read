He next brings forward his theory of God-inflicted sufferings being, in the main, chastisements proceeding from a loving purpose, intended to purify, to strengthen, to purge out faults, to "save from the pit," to improve, and to enlighten (vers. 14-24). He points out in what spirit chastisement should be received (vers. 25-30); and concludes with a recommendation to Job to remain silent, and hear him out, while at the same time he expresses a willingness to listen to what Job has to say, if he has objections to offer (vers. 31-33). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches</span>; rather, <span class="accented">howbeit</span>, <span class="accented">Job</span>, <span class="accented">I pray thee</span>, <span class="accented">hear my speech</span> (see the Revised Version); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "However you regard me personally, hear what I have to say."
