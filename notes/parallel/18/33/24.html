These words of Elihu's must have fallen on Job's ear with a grateful and refreshing sound, confirming to him his longing for the daysman (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-33.htm" title="Neither is there any judge between us, that might lay his hand on us both.">Job 9:33</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And saith</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to the destroying angels of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-22.htm" title="Yes, his soul draws near to the grave, and his life to the destroyers.">Job 33:22</a>. It is remarkable that it is <span class= "ital">God </span>who finds the ransom, as it was by God's grace that the interpreting angel was forthcoming. It is not man's righteousness that has saved him, but the ransom that God has found, even though God, who judgeth the actions, may have justly recognised what of righteousness there was in man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then he is gracious unto him; and saith</span>. Some interpret, "Then he (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God) is gracious unto him, and he (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the angel) saith. Others make God the subject of both clauses. But the angel is the natural subject. Deliver him from going down to the pit. The mediating angel thus addresses God, and adds, I have found a ransom, leaving the nature of the ransom unexplained. Some notion of ransom, or atonemeat, underlay the whole idea of sacrifice, which appears to have been universally practised from the remotest times, by the Oriental nations. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:19-28 Job complained of his diseases, and judged by them that God was angry with him; his friends did so too: but Elihu shows that God often afflicts the body for good to the soul. This thought will be of great use for our getting good from sickness, in and by which God speaks to men. Pain is the fruit of sin; yet, by the grace of God, the pain of the body is often made a means of good to the soul. When afflictions have done their work, they shall be removed. A ransom or propitiation is found. Jesus Christ is the Messenger and the Ransom, so Elihu calls him, as Job had called him his Redeemer, for he is both the Purchaser and the Price, the Priest and the sacrifice. So high was the value of souls, that nothing less would redeem them; and so great the hurt done by sin, that nothing less would atone for it, than the blood of the Son of God, who gave his life a ransom for many. A blessed change follows. Recovery from sickness is a mercy indeed, when it proceeds from the remission of sin. All that truly repent of their sins, shall find mercy with God. The works of darkness are unfruitful works; all the gains of sin will come far short of the damage. We must, with a broken and contrite heart, confess our sins to God, 1Jo 1:9. We must confess the fact of sin; and not try to justify or excuse ourselves. We must confess the fault of sin; I have perverted that which was right. We must confess the folly of sin; So foolish have I been and ignorant. Is there not good reason why we should make such a confession?</body></html>
