"Terrors' take hold upon him. He experiences in his sleep horrible dreams and visions (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-14.htm">Job 7:14</a>), and even in his waking hours he is haunted by fears. The "terrors of God do set themselves in array against him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>). God seems to him as One that watches, and "tries him every moment" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-18.htm">Job 7:18</a>), seeking occasion against him, and never leaving him an instant's peace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-19.htm">Job 7:19</a>). These terrors, he says, <span class="cmt_word">pursue my soul as the wind</span>; literally, <span class="accented">pursue mine honour</span>, or <span class="accented">my dignity.</span> They flutter the calm composure that befits a godly man, disturb it, shake it, and for a time at any rate, cause terrors and shrinkings of soul. Under these circumstances<span class="cmt_word">, my welfare passeth away as a cloud</span>. It is not only my happiness, but my real welfare, that is gone. Body and soul are equally in suffering - the one shaken with fears and disturbed with doubts and apprehensions; the other smitten with a sore disease, so that there is no soundness in it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:15-31 Job complains a great deal. Harbouring hard thoughts of God was the sin which did, at this time, most easily beset Job. When inward temptations join with outward calamities, the soul is hurried as in a tempest, and is filled with confusion. But woe be to those who really have God for an enemy! Compared with the awful state of ungodly men, what are all outward, or even inward temporal afflictions? There is something with which Job comforts himself, yet it is but a little. He foresees that death will be the end of all his troubles. God's wrath might bring him to death; but his soul would be safe and happy in the world of spirits. If none pity us, yet our God, who corrects, pities us, even as a father pitieth his own children. And let us look more to the things of eternity: then the believer will cease from mourning, and joyfully praise redeeming love.</body></html>
