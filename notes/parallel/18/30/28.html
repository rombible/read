Job feels this as the most pitiable feature in his ease. He is broken down; he can no longer endure. At first he could sit in silence for seven days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-13.htm">Job 2:13</a>); now he is reduced to uttering complaints and lamentations. <span class="cmt_word">He is a brother</span>, not to dragons, but to <span class="accented">jackals.</span> His laments are like the long melancholy cries that those animals emit during the silence of the night, so well known to Eastern travellers. He adds further that he is a companion, not to owls, but <span class="accented">to ostriches</span>; which, like jackals, have a melancholy cry (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-8.htm">Micah 1:8</a>; and comp. Dr. Hooker's article in Smith's 'Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 2. p. 650). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:15-31 Job complains a great deal. Harbouring hard thoughts of God was the sin which did, at this time, most easily beset Job. When inward temptations join with outward calamities, the soul is hurried as in a tempest, and is filled with confusion. But woe be to those who really have God for an enemy! Compared with the awful state of ungodly men, what are all outward, or even inward temporal afflictions? There is something with which Job comforts himself, yet it is but a little. He foresees that death will be the end of all his troubles. God's wrath might bring him to death; but his soul would be safe and happy in the world of spirits. If none pity us, yet our God, who corrects, pities us, even as a father pitieth his own children. And let us look more to the things of eternity: then the believer will cease from mourning, and joyfully praise redeeming love.</body></html>
