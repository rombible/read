"He," in this passage, can only be God; and thus Job turns here to some extent from his human persecutors to his great Afflicter, the Almighty. God has "loosened his <span class="accented">cord</span>" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> has relaxed his vital fibre, taken away his strength, reduced him to helplessness. Hence, and hence only, do the persecutors dare to crowd around him and insult him. <span class="cmt_word">And afflicted me</span>. God has afflicted him with blow after blow - with impoverishment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-14.htm">Job 1:14-17</a>), with bereavement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-18.htm">Job 1:18, 19</a>), with a sore malady (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-7.htm">Job 2:7</a>). They have also let loose the bridle before me. This has given his persecutors the courage to east aside all restraint, and lead him with insult after insult (vers. 1, 9, 10). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:1-14 Job contrasts his present condition with his former honour and authority. What little cause have men to be ambitious or proud of that which may be so easily lost, and what little confidence is to be put in it! We should not be cast down if we are despised, reviled, and hated by wicked men. We should look to Jesus, who endured the contradiction of sinners.</body></html>
