Having drawn the portrait of himself as he was, rich, honoured, blessed with children, flourishing, in favour with both God and man, Job now presents himself to us as he is, despised of men (vers. 1-10), afflicted of God (ver. 11), a prey to vague terrors (ver. 15), tortured with bodily pains (vers. 17, 18), cast off by God (vers. 19, 20), with nothing but death to look for (vers. 23-31). The chapter is the most touching in the whole book. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But now they that are younger than I have me in derision</span>. As Job had been speaking last of the honour in which he was once held, he beans his contrast by chewing how at present he is disgraced and derided. Men who are outcasts and solitary themselves, poor dwellers in caves (ver. 6), who have much ado to keep body and soul together (vers. 3, 4), and not men <span class="accented">only</span> but youths, mere boys, scoff at him, make him a song and a byword (ver. 9). nay, "spare not to spit in his face" (ver. 10). There seem to have been in his vicinity weak and debased tribes, generally contemned and looked down upon, regarded as thieves (ver. 5) by their neighbours, and considered to be of base and vile origin (ver. 8), who saw in Job's calamities a rare opportunity for insulting and triumphing over a member of the superior race which had crushed them, and thus tasting, to a certain extent, the sweetness of revenge. <span class="cmt_word">Whose fathers I would have disdained</span> (rather, I <span class="accented">disdained</span>) <span class="cmt_word">to have set with the dogs of my flock</span>. Job had not <span class="accented">thought</span> their fathers <span class="accented">worthy of employ</span>ing even as the lowest class of herdsmen, those reckoned on a par with the sheep-dogs. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:1-14 Job contrasts his present condition with his former honour and authority. What little cause have men to be ambitious or proud of that which may be so easily lost, and what little confidence is to be put in it! We should not be cast down if we are despised, reviled, and hated by wicked men. We should look to Jesus, who endured the contradiction of sinners.</body></html>
