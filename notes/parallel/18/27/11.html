But the hypotheses which would make Job irresponsible for the present utterance and fix on him, as his steadfast conviction, the opposite theory, are unsatisfactory and have no solid basis. To suppose that Zophar is the real speaker is to imagine the absolute loss and suppression of two entire verses - one between vers. 10 and 11, assigning the speech to him, and another at the beginning of ch. 28, reintroducing Job and making him once more the interlocutor. That this should have happened by accident is inconceivable. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> To ascribe it to intentional corruption by a Hebrew redactor, bent on maintaining the old orthodox view, and on falsely and wickedly giving the authority of Job to it (Froude 'Short Studies on Great Subjects,' vol. 1. p. 316), is to take away all authority from the existing text of the Hebrew Scriptures, and to open a door to any amount of wild suggestion and conjectural emendation. The other hypothesis - that of Eichhorn - that Job is here simply anticipating what his adversaries will say, though a less dangerous view, is untenable, since Job never does this without following up his statement of the adversaries' ease with a reply, and here is no reply whatever, but a simple turning away, after ver. 23, to another subject. The explanation of the contradiction by supposing that Job's former statement was tentative and controversial, or else hasty and ill-considered, and that now, to prevent misconception, he determines to set himself right, is, on the other hand, thoroughly defensible, and receives a strong support from the remarkable introduction in ver. 11, which "prepares us, if not for a recantation, yet (at any rate) for a modification of statements wrung from the speaker when his words flowed over from a spirit drunk with the poison of God's arrows" (see the remarks of Canon Cook, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 90, which are in substantial agreement with those of Ewald said Dillmann). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will teach you by</span> (or, concerning) <span class="cmt_word">the hand of God</span>. Job is now at last about to deliver his real sentiments respecting God's dealings with men in the world, and prefaces his. remarks with this solemn introduction, to draw special attention to them. He is aware that his previous statements on the subject, especially in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-2.htm">Job 24:2-24</a>, have been overstrained and exaggerated, and wishes, now that he is uttering his last words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-40.htm">Job 31:40</a>), to correct his previous hasty utterances, and put on record his true views. <span class="cmt_word">That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal</span>. By "that which is with the Almighty" Job means the Divine principles of action. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:11-23 Job's friends, on the same subject, spoke of the misery of wicked men before death as proportioned to their crimes; Job considered that if it were not so, still the consequences of their death would be dreadful. Job undertook to set this matter in a true light. Death to a godly man, is like a fair gale of wind to convey him to the heavenly country; but, to a wicked man, it is like a storm, that hurries him away to destruction. While he lived, he had the benefit of sparing mercy; but now the day of God's patience is over, and he will pour out upon him his wrath. When God casts down a man, there is no flying from, nor bearing up under his anger. Those who will not now flee to the arms of Divine grace, which are stretched out to receive them, will not be able to flee from the arms of Divine wrath, which will shortly be stretched out to destroy them. And what is a man profited if he gain the whole world, and thus lose his own soul?</body></html>
