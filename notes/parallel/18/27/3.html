The spirit of God, originally breathed into man's nostrils, whereby he became a living soul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>), is still, Job says, within him, and makes him capable of judging and declaring what is right. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-6 Job's friends now suffered him to speak, and he proceeded in a grave and useful manner. Job had confidence in the goodness both of his cause and of his God; and cheerfully committed his cause to him. But Job had not due reverence when he spake of God as taking away his judgment, and vexing his soul. To resolve that our hearts shall not reproach us, while we hold fast our integrity, baffles the designs of the evil spirit.</body></html>
