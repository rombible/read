Not only will Job never cease to maintain his integrity in the past, but he will hold fast to the same course of blameless life in the future. He will not "curse God, and die." Resolutely he will maintain his faith in God, and his dependence on him. "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him." <span class="cmt_word">My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live</span>. This is probably the true meaning, though some suggest "My heart doth not reproach me for any of my days" Job determines to "have always a conscience void of offence, both toward God and toward man" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-16.htm">Acts 24:16</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-1.htm">Acts 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-4.htm">1 Corinthians 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-3.htm">2 Timothy 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-21.htm">1 John 3:21</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-6 Job's friends now suffered him to speak, and he proceeded in a grave and useful manner. Job had confidence in the goodness both of his cause and of his God; and cheerfully committed his cause to him. But Job had not due reverence when he spake of God as taking away his judgment, and vexing his soul. To resolve that our hearts shall not reproach us, while we hold fast our integrity, baffles the designs of the evil spirit.</body></html>
