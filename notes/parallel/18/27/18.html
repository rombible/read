The moth is the symbol of fragility, decay, and weakness. The wicked man's attempt to build himself up a house, and establish a powerful family, is no better than a moth's attempt to make itself a permanent habitation. As moths do not construct dwellings for themselves, it has been proposed (Merx) to read <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5e2;&#x5db;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, "as a spider," for <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, "as a moth;" but the change is too great to be at all probable. May not the cocoon, from which the moth issues as. from a house, have been in Job's mind? The hawk-moth buries itself in a neat cave for the pupa stage; and there may have been even better examples in Uz. But we ourselves have not known these facts long, and therefore we need not be surprised to find Job making a mistake in natural history. <span class="cmt_word">And as a booth that the keeper maketh</span>. Huts or lodges of boughs were set up in vineyards and orchards by those who had to watch them (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-6.htm">Lamentations 2:6</a>). They were habitations of the weakest and frailest kind. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:11-23 Job's friends, on the same subject, spoke of the misery of wicked men before death as proportioned to their crimes; Job considered that if it were not so, still the consequences of their death would be dreadful. Job undertook to set this matter in a true light. Death to a godly man, is like a fair gale of wind to convey him to the heavenly country; but, to a wicked man, it is like a storm, that hurries him away to destruction. While he lived, he had the benefit of sparing mercy; but now the day of God's patience is over, and he will pour out upon him his wrath. When God casts down a man, there is no flying from, nor bearing up under his anger. Those who will not now flee to the arms of Divine grace, which are stretched out to receive them, will not be able to flee from the arms of Divine wrath, which will shortly be stretched out to destroy them. And what is a man profited if he gain the whole world, and thus lose his own soul?</body></html>
