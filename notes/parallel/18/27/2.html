His "yea has been yea, and his nay nay." Now, however, under the solemn circumstances of the occasion, when he is making his last appeal to his friends for a favourable judgment, he thinks it not inappropriate to preface what he is about to say by an appeal to God as his Witness. "As God liveth," or "As the Lord liveth," was the customary oath of pious Israelites and of God-fearing men generally in the ancient world (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-19.htm">Judges 8:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-13.htm">Ruth 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-39.htm">1 Samuel 14:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-3.htm">1 Samuel 20:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-9.htm">2 Samuel 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-5.htm">2 Samuel 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-24.htm">1 Kings 2:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-21.htm">1 Kings 17:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-20.htm">2 Kings 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-13.htm">2 Chronicles 18:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-16.htm">Jeremiah 38:16</a>). Job adds that the God to whom he appeals is he who has "taken away," or "withheld," his judgment, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> who has declined to enter with him into a controversy as to the justice of his doings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-32.htm">Job 9:32-35</a>; 13:31; 23:3-7). <span class="cmt_word">And the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul</span>; or, <span class="accented">made my soul bitter.</span> Though he slays him, yet does Job trust in God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>). He is his Witness, his Helper, his Redeemer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-6 Job's friends now suffered him to speak, and he proceeded in a grave and useful manner. Job had confidence in the goodness both of his cause and of his God; and cheerfully committed his cause to him. But Job had not due reverence when he spake of God as taking away his judgment, and vexing his soul. To resolve that our hearts shall not reproach us, while we hold fast our integrity, baffles the designs of the evil spirit.</body></html>
