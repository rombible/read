The question reminds us of those words of our blessed <span class="accented">Lord</span> "What shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"

If they gained through life by their profession, and kept up their presumptuous hope till death, what would that avail when God required their souls? The more comfort we find in our religion, the more closely we shall cleave to it. Those who have no delight in God, are easily drawn away by the pleasures, and easily overcome by the crosses of this life.</body></html>
