Some have suggested the transposition of these three verses to the end of the chapter. Though this is obviously their natural position in one sense, yet in another it is less natural. The same thing is to be seen in the last four verses of chapter 31. They carry on the previous vindication from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-34.htm" title="Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?">Job 31:34</a>, which had been broken by the parenthesis in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/31-35.htm" title="Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that my adversary had written a book.">Job 31:35-37</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then I said, I shall die in my nest</span>. The metaphor of "nest" for "dwelling-place" occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-21.htm">Numbers 24:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-16.htm">Jeremiah 49:16</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 1:4</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-9.htm">Habakkuk 2:9</a>. It is also employed by Healed ('Op. et Di.,' 1:301). <span class="cmt_word">And I shall multiply my days as the sand.</span> Some translate, "I shall multiply my days as the phoenix," the fabulous bird which was supposed to live for five hundred years (Herod., 2:72), to burn itself on a funeral pile of spices, and then to rise again from its ashes. But the view seems to be a mere rabbinical tradition, and is unsupported by etymology. <span class="accented">Khal</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>) means "sand" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-22.htm">Jeremiah 33:22</a>; and elsewhere. It is taken in this sense by Rosenmuller, Schultens, Professor Lee, Canon Cook, and our Revisers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:18-25 Being thus honoured and useful, Job had hoped to die in peace and honour, in a good old age. If such an expectation arise from lively faith in the providence and promise of God, it is well; but if from conceit of our own wisdom, and dependence on changeable, earthly things, it is ill grounded, and turns to sin. Every one that has the spirit of wisdom, has not the spirit of government; but Job had both. Yet he had the tenderness of a comforter. This he thought upon with pleasure, when he was himself a mourner. Our Lord Jesus is a King who hates iniquity, and upon whom the blessing of a world ready to perish comes. To Him let us give ear.</body></html>
