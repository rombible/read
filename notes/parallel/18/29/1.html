In his case it was indeed not without cause, though in point of fact he was <span class= "ital">then </span>passing through a time of trial which was itself bringing fast on his time of deliverance, and which was to make his name famous throughout the world and in all time. And in most similar cases we have need to bear in mind the words of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-10.htm" title="Say not you, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for you do not inquire wisely concerning this.">Ecclesiastes 7:10</a>): "Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-25.</span> - From these deep musings upon the nature of true wisdom, and the contrast between the ingenuity and cleverness of man and the infinite knowledge of God, Job turns to another contrast, which he pursues through two chapters (ch. 29. and 30.) - the contrast between what he was and what he is - between his condition in the period of his prosperity and that to which he has been reduced by his afflictions. The present chapter is concerned only with the former period; and gives a graphic description of the life led, in Job's time and country, by a great chieftain, the head of a tribe, not of mere nomads, but of perseus who had attained to a considerable amount of civilization. The picture is one primitive in its features, but not rude or coarse. It is entirely un-Jewish, and has its nearest parallel in some of the early Egyptian records, as the Stele of Beka, and the Instructions of Amen-em-hat ('Records of the Past,' vol. 2. pp. 11-16; vol. 10. pp. 7-10). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover Job continued his parable, and said</span> (see the comment on Job 27:1). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:1-6 Job proceeds to contrast his former prosperity with his present misery, through God's withdrawing from him. A gracious soul delights in God's smiles, not in the smiles of this world. Four things were then very pleasant to holy Job. 1. The confidence he had in the Divine protection. 2. The enjoyment he had of the Divine favour. 3. The communion he had with the Divine word. 4. The assurance he had of the Divine presence. God's presence with a man in his house, though it be but a cottage, makes it a castle and a palace. Then also he had comfort in his family. Riches and flourishing families, like a candle, may be soon extinguished. But when the mind is enlightened by the Holy Spirit, when a man walks in the light of God's countenance, every outward comfort is doubled, every trouble is diminished, and he may pass cheerfully by this light through life and through death. Yet the sensible comfort of this state is often withdrawn for a season; and commonly this arises from sinful neglect, and grieving the Holy Spirit: sometimes it may be a trial of a man's faith and grace. But it is needful to examine ourselves, to seek for the cause of such a change by fervent prayer, and to increase our watchfulness.</body></html>
