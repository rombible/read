These are terribly sad words. Job, in his afflictions, has come to look on the Almighty as no longer "with him " - no longer on his side; but rather against him, an enemy (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-19.htm">Job 7:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-17.htm">Job 9:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-16.htm">Job 10:16</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">When my children were about me</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-2.htm">Job 1:2, 4, 5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:1-6 Job proceeds to contrast his former prosperity with his present misery, through God's withdrawing from him. A gracious soul delights in God's smiles, not in the smiles of this world. Four things were then very pleasant to holy Job. 1. The confidence he had in the Divine protection. 2. The enjoyment he had of the Divine favour. 3. The communion he had with the Divine word. 4. The assurance he had of the Divine presence. God's presence with a man in his house, though it be but a cottage, makes it a castle and a palace. Then also he had comfort in his family. Riches and flourishing families, like a candle, may be soon extinguished. But when the mind is enlightened by the Holy Spirit, when a man walks in the light of God's countenance, every outward comfort is doubled, every trouble is diminished, and he may pass cheerfully by this light through life and through death. Yet the sensible comfort of this state is often withdrawn for a season; and commonly this arises from sinful neglect, and grieving the Holy Spirit: sometimes it may be a trial of a man's faith and grace. But it is needful to examine ourselves, to seek for the cause of such a change by fervent prayer, and to increase our watchfulness.</body></html>
