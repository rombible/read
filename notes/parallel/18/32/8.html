But, after all, it is not mere age and experience that make men wise and able to teach others. "There is a spirit in man" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>); and it is according as this spirit is or is not enlightened from on high that men speak words of wisdom or the contrary. <span class="cmt_word">The inspiration of the Almighty</span> - this it is, which - <span class="cmt_word">giveth them understanding</span>. And such inspiration it is in the power of God to bestow, as he pleases, on the old or on the young, on the great of the earth, or on those of small reputation. Hence Elihu's conclusion - <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:6-14 Elihu professes to speak by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and corrects both parties. He allowed that those who had the longest experience should speak first. But God gives wisdom as he pleases; this encouraged him to state his opinion. By attention to the word of God, and dependence upon the Holy Spirit, young men may become wiser than the aged; but this wisdom will render them swift to hear, slow to speak, and disposed to give others a patient hearing.</body></html>
