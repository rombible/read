Barachel is also a significant name. It means, "Bless, O God," or "God blesses" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span>). Both names imply that the new interlocutor belonged to a family of monotheists. <span class="cmt_word">The Buzite</span>. "Huz" and "Buz" were brothers, the sons of Nahor, Abraham's brother, by Maleah, the daughter of Haran (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-29.htm">Genesis 11:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-20.htm">Genesis 22:20, 21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of the kindred of Ram.</span> By "Ram" we are probably to understand "Aram," who was the son of Kemuel, a brother of Huz and Buz. (On the connection of Huz and Buz with the Arabian tribes of Khazu and Bazu, see the comment on Job 1:1.) <span class="cmt_word">Against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God</span>. Elihu was well-intentional; and it is perhaps not surprising that he had been shocked by some of Job's expressions. Job had himself apologized for them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-26.htm">Job 6:26</a>); and certainly they went perilously near taxing God with injustice (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-8.htm">Job 40:8</a>). But it is to be remembered that finally God justifies Job's sayings, while condemning those of his "comforters." "My wrath is kindled," he says to Eliphaz, "against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me <span class="accented">the thing that is right</span> <span class="accented">as my servant Job</span> hath" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-7.htm">Job 42:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:1-5 Job's friends were silenced, but not convinced. Others had been present. Elihu was justly displeased with Job, as more anxious to clear his own character than the justice and goodness of God. Elihu was displeased with Job's friends because they had not been candid to Job. Seldom is a quarrel begun, more seldom is a quarrel carried on, in which there are not faults on both sides. Those that seek for truth, must not reject what is true and good on either side, nor approve or defend what is wrong.</body></html>
