Some commentators regard Elihu's character with great disfavour, and consider him to be an empty and arrogant talker, mainly, perhaps, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/32-18.htm" title="For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constrains me.">Job 32:18-19</a>; others accept him as a wise and pious friend of Job, who not only gave him good advice, but perhaps more nearly than any other of the disputants hit the truth about Job's afflictions. We are probably more right in this latter view, because at the climax of the poem we do not read that Elihu had any share in the condemnation which was passed by God on the three friends of Job. He is not noticed for either praise or blame.<p>It is to be observed that the last eight verses of this chapter are a kind of soliloquy, unlike the former part of it, which was addressed to the friends, or the next chapter, which is addressed to Job.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I know not to give flattering titles</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it is not my habit to give flattering titles, nor have I any knowledge of the art. <span class="cmt_word">I should expect that, if such were my habit, my Maker would soon take me away</span>; would soon, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, remove me from the earth, as one whose influence was not for good, but for evil.

God is the God of order, not of confusion. It is great refreshment to a good man, to speak for the glory of the Lord, and to edify others. And the more we consider the majesty of God, as our Maker, and the more we dread his wrath and justice, the less shall we sinfully fear or flatter men. Could we set the wrath Lord always before us, in his mercies and his terrors, we should not be moved from doing our duty in whatever we are called to do.</body></html>
