It gives us also a picture of the times and habits.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-22.</span> - The speech of Elihu now begins. In the present chapter, after a short apologetic exordium, excusing his youth (vers. 6-9), he addresses himself exclusively to Job's friends. He has listened attentively to them, and weighed their words (vers. 11, 12). but has found nothing in them that confuted Job. They had not "found wisdom" - they had not "vanquished Job" - at the last they had been "amazed, and had not had a word more to say" (vers. 13-16). Elihu, therefore, will supply their deficiency; he has kept silence with difficulty, and is full of thoughts, to which he would fain give utterance (vers. 17-20). In all that he says he will show no favouritism - he will "accept no man's-person," "give no flattering titles," but express sincerely what he believes (vers. 21, 22). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old</span>. We can only guess at the exact ages of Job and his friends. From the fact that God at the last "gave Job twice as much as he had before" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10</a>), and the further fact that he lived, after he had recovered his prosperity, a hundred and forty years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-16.htm">Job 42:16</a>), it has been conjectured that he was seventy years of age at the time of his conference with his friends, and that he died at the age of two hundred and ten. But this clearly is quite uncertain. He may not have been much more than fifty when his calamities fell upon him. If this were so, the age of his friends need not have exceeded from sixty to seventy. Perhaps Elihu was himself not more than thirty. <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore I was afraid, and durst not show you mine opinion</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I held back and was afraid to utter what I knew in your pre</span>sence. Elihu would have been thought unduly pushing and presumptuous if he had ventured to come forward until his seniors had ended their colloquy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:6-14 Elihu professes to speak by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and corrects both parties. He allowed that those who had the longest experience should speak first. But God gives wisdom as he pleases; this encouraged him to state his opinion. By attention to the word of God, and dependence upon the Holy Spirit, young men may become wiser than the aged; but this wisdom will render them swift to hear, slow to speak, and disposed to give others a patient hearing.</body></html>
