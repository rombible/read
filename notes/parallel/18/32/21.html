Elihu hopes that, in what he is about to say, he will not permit himself to be swayed by any personal bias; that he will neither unduly favour the upper classes nor the vulgar (see Professor Lee, on the difference between <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d3;&#x5dd;</span> 'Book of Job,' p. 444), but will treat all fairly and equitably. <span class="cmt_word">Neither let me</span> (he says) <span class="cmt_word">give flattering titles unto man</span>. Professor Lee observes on this: "The Oriental practice of giving long and fulsome titles is too well known to need anything beyond the mere mention of the fact." Elihu certainly, in the whole of his address, flatters no one. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:15-22 If we are sure that the Spirit of God suggested what we are about to say, still we ought to refrain, till it comes to our turn to speak. God is the God of order, not of confusion. It is great refreshment to a good man, to speak for the glory of the Lord, and to edify others. And the more we consider the majesty of God, as our Maker, and the more we dread his wrath and justice, the less shall we sinfully fear or flatter men. Could we set the wrath Lord always before us, in his mercies and his terrors, we should not be moved from doing our duty in whatever we are called to do.</body></html>
