And yet had condemned Job. They had condemned him on wrong grounds and of sins that he had not committed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-6.htm">Job 22:6-9</a>).

Elihu was displeased with Job's friends because they had not been candid to Job. Seldom is a quarrel begun, more seldom is a quarrel carried on, in which there are not faults on both sides. Those that seek for truth, must not reject what is true and good on either side, nor approve or defend what is wrong.</body></html>
