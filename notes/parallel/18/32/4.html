The line taken by Elihu is an intermediate one, and is neither that of Job nor his friends. He admits the integrity of Job--or, at least, he does not deny it--although he uses very strong expressions as to the course which Job has adopted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/34-7.htm" title="What man is like Job, who drinks up scorning like water?">Job 34:7-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/34-35.htm" title="Job has spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.">Job 34:35-37</a>); but he considers that the Divine afflictions have a disciplinary object, and that they may be sent because God has discerned the seeds of unfaithfulness and defection in the sufferer; and this may serve to explain their purpose in the case of Job. He has very lofty ideas of the righteousness of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-10.htm" title="Therefore listen to me you men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.">Job 34:10</a>, &c.), and of His power and majesty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-22.htm" title="Fair weather comes out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.">Job 37:22</a>). He holds that with regard to the Almighty we cannot find Him out, but that we may safely trust His mercy and His justice. This is the position to which he leads Job when the Lord answers him out of the whirlwind.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken</span>; rather, <span class="accented">to speak to Job</span> (see the Revised Version) He had waited impatiently until the three special "friends" had said their say, and be might come forward without manifest presumption. <span class="cmt_word">Because they were elder than he</span>. (On the respect paid to age at this time in the land wherein Job lived, see the comment on Job 29:8.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:1-5 Job's friends were silenced, but not convinced. Others had been present. Elihu was justly displeased with Job, as more anxious to clear his own character than the justice and goodness of God. Elihu was displeased with Job's friends because they had not been candid to Job. Seldom is a quarrel begun, more seldom is a quarrel carried on, in which there are not faults on both sides. Those that seek for truth, must not reject what is true and good on either side, nor approve or defend what is wrong.</body></html>
