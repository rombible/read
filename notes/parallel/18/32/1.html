The name appears to mean, <span class= "ital">He is my God. </span>The person from whom he was descended seems to have been the son of Nahor, Abraham's brother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-21.htm" title="Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,">Genesis 22:21</a>); and a city of the like name is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-23.htm" title="Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmost corners,">Jeremiah 25:23</a>. There is a Ram mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-19.htm" title="And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,">Ruth 4:19</a>, who was the great grandson of Judah; but we can hardly suppose this was the Ram of whose kindred Elihu was. On the other hand, we have no clue to the identification; for even if, with some, we suppose him to have been the same as Aram, the son of Kemuel, and great nephew of Abraham, it is not easy to see how a descendant of Buz, his uncle, should have been described as of the kindred of Ram. One tradition identifies Ram with Abraham, but this is mere conjecture, and in this case highly improbable; the only inference we can draw is that this specification of Elihu serves to show that he was a real, and not an imaginary, personage. The Targum speaks of Elihu as a relative of Abraham. If we are right in putting the life of Elihu so far back, the whole position and surroundings of Job's history become the more probable, because what is told us of Abraham and the patriarchs corresponds with the description and character of Job; and then, also, the traditional Mosaic origin of the Book of Job becomes the more probable.<p><span class= "bld">Because he was righteous in his own eyes.</span>--This appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-26.htm" title="I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.">Job 3:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-10.htm" title="Then should I yet have comfort; yes, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.">Job 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-29.htm" title="Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yes, return again, my righteousness is in it.">Job 6:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-7.htm" title="You know that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of your hand.">Job 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-15.htm" title="Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain my own ways before him.">Job 13:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-6.htm" title="Know now that God has overthrown me, and has compassed me with his net.">Job 19:6</a>, &c., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-7.htm" title="There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.">Job 23:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/23-10.htm" title="But he knows the way that I take: when he has tried me, I shall come forth as gold.">Job 23:10-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-6.htm" title="My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.">Job 27:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-12.htm" title="Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.">Job 29:12</a>, &c.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-5.</span> - The discourse of Elihu is prefaced by a short introduction in plain prose, explaining who he was, and giving the reasons which actuated him in coming forward at this point of the dialogue. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So these three men ceased to answer</span> <span class="cmt_word">Job</span>. Zophar had been silenced earlier. Eliphaz and Bildad now felt that they had no more to say. They had exhausted the weapons of their armoury without any effect, and were conscious that nothing would be gained by mere reiteration. All their efforts had aimed at convincing Job of sin; and he was still unconvinced - he remained righteous in his own eyes. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:1-5 Job's friends were silenced, but not convinced. Others had been present. Elihu was justly displeased with Job, as more anxious to clear his own character than the justice and goodness of God. Elihu was displeased with Job's friends because they had not been candid to Job. Seldom is a quarrel begun, more seldom is a quarrel carried on, in which there are not faults on both sides. Those that seek for truth, must not reject what is true and good on either side, nor approve or defend what is wrong.</body></html>
