(see the Revised Version). Eliphaz assumes that it is Job's intention to cast in his lot with these persons whose prosperous wickedness he has described in the preceding chapter (vers. 7-15). And this notwithstanding Job's final protest, "Be the counsel of the wicked far from me" (ver. 16). He calls the mode of life pursued by these wicked persons "the old way," either with allusion to the seed of Cain before the Flood, who "corrupted their way" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-12.htm">Genesis 6:12</a>), or perhaps with reference to the descendants of Nimrod after it (see Professor Lee's 'Book of Job,' p. 361). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:15-20 Eliphaz would have Job mark the old way that wicked men have trodden, and see what the end of their way was. It is good for us to mark it, that we may not walk therein. But if others are consumed, and we are not, instead of blaming them, and lifting up ourselves, as Eliphaz does here, we ought to be thankful to God, and take it for a warning.</body></html>
