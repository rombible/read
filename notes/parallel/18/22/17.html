The idea is the same as that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-15.htm">Job 21:15</a>, though not expressed so pointedly.

It is good for us to mark it, that we may not walk therein. But if others are consumed, and we are not, instead of blaming them, and lifting up ourselves, as Eliphaz does here, we ought to be thankful to God, and take it for a warning.</body></html>
