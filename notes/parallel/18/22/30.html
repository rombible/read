"He would have delivered him that is not innocent; yea, even so shall he be delivered by the cleanness of thy hands," as the ten righteous would have saved Sodom. It is remarkable that this, which is the last word of Eliphaz, has in it the significance of a prophecy, for it is exactly thus that the history of Job closes; and Eliphaz himself exemplified his own promise in being indebted to Job for the act of intercession by which he was pardoned, together with his friends; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/42-8.htm" title="Therefore take to you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that you have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.">Job 42:8-9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall deliver the island of the innocent</span>; rather, he <span class="accented">shall deliver even him that is not innocent</span> (see the Revised Version). It is now generally admitted that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span> in this place is for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-21.htm">1 Samuel 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-4.htm">Proverbs 31:4</a>. The meaning seems to be that God will deliver, at Job's prayer, even guilty persons, who will be <span class="cmt_word">delivered by the pureness of Job's hands</span>. Eliphaz thus prophesies his own deliverance and that of his two friends from God's wrath at the intercession of Job, as actually came to pass afterwards (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-7.htm">Job 42:7-9</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:21-30 The answer of Eliphaz wrongly implied that Job had hitherto not known God, and that prosperity in this life would follow his sincere conversion. The counsel Eliphaz here gives is good, though, as to Job, it was built upon a false supposition that he was a stranger and enemy to God. Let us beware of slandering our brethren; and if it be our lot to suffer in this manner, let us remember how Job was treated; yea, how Jesus was reviled, that we may be patient. Let us examine whether there may not be some colour for the slander, and walk watchfully, so as to be clear of all appearances of evil.</body></html>
