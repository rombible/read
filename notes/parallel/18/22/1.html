He begins by asserting that the judgment of God cannot be other than disinterested, that if, therefore, He rewards or punishes, there cannot be anything personal in it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-30.</span> - Eliphaz returns to the attack, but with observations that are at first strangely pointless and irrelevant, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> on the unprofitableness of man to God (vers. l, 2), and on the slight importance of Job's case (ver. 3). After this weak prelude, however, there is more vigour in his assault. In vers. 4-9 he directly charges Job with a number of specified sins, and in vers. 10, 11 declares his sufferings to be the consequence of them. He then proceeds to accuse him of denying God's omniscience (vers. 12-14), and, alter some not very successful attempts to retort on him his own words (vers. 15-20), finally recurs to his favourite devices (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-17.htm">Job 5:17-26</a>) of exhorting Job to submission and repentance, and promising him restoration to God's favour and a return of prosperity (vers. 21-30). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, Can a man be profitable unto God?</span> Job had <span class="accented">said</span> nothing upon this point; but perhaps Eliphaz thinks his complaints and expostulations to <span class="accented">imply</span> a higher value in man, and a greater claim to consideration at God's hands, than can rightly be challenged. Certainly God does not depend on man for profit or advantage of any kind. Neither our wisdom nor our goodness "extendeth to him." As he that is wise may be profitable unto himself; rather, <span class="accented">truly he that is wise is profitable unto himself</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to himself only, and not to God. Man's intelligence and researches can add nothing to God's knowledge. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-4 Eliphaz considers that, because Job complained so much of his afflictions, he thought God was unjust in afflicting him; but Job was far from thinking so. What Eliphaz says, is unjustly applied to Job, but it is very true, that when God does us good it is not because he is indebted to us. Man's piety is no profit to God, no gain. The gains of religion to men are infinitely greater than the losses of it. God is a Sovereign, who gives no account of his conduct; but he is perfectly wise, just, faithful, good, and merciful. He approves the likeness of his own holiness, and delights in the fruits of his Spirit; he accepts the thankful services of the humble believer, while he rejects the proud claim of the self-confident.</body></html>
