To give water to the thirsty was regarded in the East as one of the most elementary duties of man to man. The self-justification of the dead in the Egyptian Hades contained the following passage: "I gave my bread to the hungry, <span class="accented">and drink to him that was athirst</span>; I clothed the naked with garments; I sheltered the wanderer" ('Ritual of the Dead,' ch. CXXV. &sect; 38). The same claim appears continually on Egyptian tombs. "All men respected me," we read on one; "I <span class="accented">gave water to the thirsty</span>; I set the wanderer in his path; I took away the oppressor, and put a stop to violence" ('Non-Biblical Systems of Religion,' p. 46). In the proverbs assigned to Solomon, "which the men of Hezekiah copied out" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-1.htm">Proverbs 25:1</a>), the duty was declared to be one owed even to enemies (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-21.htm">Proverbs 25:21</a>, "If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, <span class="accented">give him water to drink"</span>). Isaiah notices it as praiseworthy in the Temanites (Eliphaz's people), that they "<span class="accented">brought water to him that was thirsty</span> and prevented with their bread him that fled" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-14.htm">Isaiah 21:14</a>). Jael is praised for going further than this: He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-25.htm">Judges 5:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry</span>. Later on Job absolutely denies this, as well as many of the other charges. "If I have withheld," he says, "the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; or <span class="accented">have eaten my morsel myself alone</span>, <span class="accented">and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof</span>," then let mine arm fall from my shoulder-blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-16.htm">Job 31:16-22</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:5-14 Eliphaz brought heavy charges against Job, without reason for his accusations, except that Job was visited as he supposed God always visited every wicked man. He charges him with oppression, and that he did harm with his wealth and power in the time of his prosperity.</body></html>
