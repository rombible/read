Now Job prays, but is not heard; he asks for death, but it does not come; he begs for a respite from suffering, but it is refused him; he beseeches God to enter into argument with him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-32.htm">Job 9:32-34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-2.htm">Job 10:2</a>), but God vouchsafes no answer. Let him follow Eliphaz's advice, "return to the Almighty" (ver. 23), humble himself in the dust, repent and "put away his iniquity" (ver. 23), and then, Eliphaz promises him, all shall be changed - God will become gracious to him, will listen to him, and grant his requests, will remove his heavy hand, and crown him with mercy and loving-kindness. Then, he adds, <span class="cmt_word">thou shalt pay thy vows.</span> Thou shalt have wealth enough, and strength enough, to pay any vows that thou hast made, which now in thy afflicted state thou canst not do. Vows are part of natural religion, and were widely prevalent over all the East in ancient times. The performance of vows, which was strictly enjoined in the Mosaic Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21</a>), must at all times have been felt as obligatory by the natural conscience. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:21-30 The answer of Eliphaz wrongly implied that Job had hitherto not known God, and that prosperity in this life would follow his sincere conversion. The counsel Eliphaz here gives is good, though, as to Job, it was built upon a false supposition that he was a stranger and enemy to God. Let us beware of slandering our brethren; and if it be our lot to suffer in this manner, let us remember how Job was treated; yea, how Jesus was reviled, that we may be patient. Let us examine whether there may not be some colour for the slander, and walk watchfully, so as to be clear of all appearances of evil.</body></html>
