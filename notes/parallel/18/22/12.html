He does not acknowledge, Eliphaz says, either the majesty or the omniscience of God. Here he has, at any rate, some tangible ground for his reproaches. Job's words have been over-bold, over-venturesome. He has seemed to forget the distance between God and man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-30.htm">Job 9:30-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-2.htm">Job 10:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3</a>, etc.), and to call in question either God's omniscience or his regard for moral distinctions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7-13, 23-26</a>). Hence Eliphaz is enabled to take a high tone and ask, "Hast thou forgotten that God is in the height of heaven, far up above all us poor wretched mortals? Dost thou need to be reminded of this? He is above the stars, and yet behold the height of the stars, how high they are! Even they are infinitely above men, yet how far below <span class="accented">him</span>!" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-5.htm">Job 35:5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:5-14 Eliphaz brought heavy charges against Job, without reason for his accusations, except that Job was visited as he supposed God always visited every wicked man. He charges him with oppression, and that he did harm with his wealth and power in the time of his prosperity.</body></html>
