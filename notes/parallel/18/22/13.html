The psalmist implies that many men so thought (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-11.htm">Psalm 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-11.htm">Psalm 73:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-7.htm">Psalm 94:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Can he judge through the dark cloud?</span> rather, <span class="accented">through the thick darkness.</span> God was supposed to dwell remote from man, in the highest heaven, and, according to many, "clouds and darkness were round about him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-2.htm">Psalm 97:2</a>) - he "dwelt in the thick darkness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-12.htm">1 Kings 8:12</a>) - he "made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him was waters, and thick clouds of the skies" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>). The imagery was, no doubt, at first used in reference to man's inability to see and know God; but when men became familiar with it, they turned the metaphor round, and questioned God's ability to see and know anything about man. Job had not really ever shared in these doubts; but it suits Eliphaz's purpose to malign and misrepresent him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:5-14 Eliphaz brought heavy charges against Job, without reason for his accusations, except that Job was visited as he supposed God always visited every wicked man. He charges him with oppression, and that he did harm with his wealth and power in the time of his prosperity.</body></html>
