The rendering in the Authorised Version is probably less correct, though in that also these words seem to be those of the innocent in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-19.htm" title="The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.">Job 22:19</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whereas our substance is not cut down</span>. It is best to take these as the words of the righteous in their triumph over the wicked; but they can scarcely bear the interpretation given them in the Authorized Version. The clause is not really negative but affirmative, and the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. does not mean "substance," but "adversary." Translate, <span class="accented">Surely they that rose up against us</span> (or, <span class="accented">our adversaries</span>) <span class="accented">are cut off</span>; and compare the Revised Version. The "adversaries" of the righteous are the "wicked men" who have been "snatched away before their time," and have had their "foundation overflown with a flood" (ver. 16). <span class="cmt_word">But the remnant of them the fire consumeth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and the remnant of them hath the fire consumed</span> (see the Revised Version). The "fire" here, like the "flood" in ver. 16, is a metaphor, and therefore not to be pressed. All that is essential is that the wicked are destroyed. Over this the "righteous" and the "innocent" rejoice. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:15-20 Eliphaz would have Job mark the old way that wicked men have trodden, and see what the end of their way was. It is good for us to mark it, that we may not walk therein. But if others are consumed, and we are not, instead of blaming them, and lifting up ourselves, as Eliphaz does here, we ought to be thankful to God, and take it for a warning.</body></html>
