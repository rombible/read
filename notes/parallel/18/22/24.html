The sense probably is, "Put thy treasure on a level with the dust, and the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks": that is, reckon it of no more value than such stones; do not set thine heart upon it. The situation of Ophir has always been a matter of dispute. Josephus placed it in India (<span class= "ital">Antt. viii.</span> 6<span class= "ital">, </span>? 4), as do some moderns; others suppose it to have been an Indian colony in Southern Arabia, and others have placed it on the east coast of Africa.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust</span>; rather, <span class="accented">then</span> <span class="accented">shalt thou lay thy treasure in the dust</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> hold it in slight esteem, because of its abundance. <span class="cmt_word">And the gold of Ophir</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and Ophir</span>) <span class="cmt_word">shall be to thee as the stones of the brooks</span>, (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-27.htm">2 Chronicles 9:27</a>, "And the king [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Solomon] made silver in Jerusalem as stones"). "Ophir" stands, no doubt, for untold wealth, being the great gold- producing country (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-28.htm">1 Kings 9:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-11.htm">1 Kings 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>; 1 Chronicles 29:41; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-12.htm">Isaiah 13:12</a>). (On its location, see the article on "Ophir," in Smith's 'Dict. of the Bible,' vol 2. pp. 637-652, and compare the comment on Job 28:16.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:21-30 The answer of Eliphaz wrongly implied that Job had hitherto not known God, and that prosperity in this life would follow his sincere conversion. The counsel Eliphaz here gives is good, though, as to Job, it was built upon a false supposition that he was a stranger and enemy to God. Let us beware of slandering our brethren; and if it be our lot to suffer in this manner, let us remember how Job was treated; yea, how Jesus was reviled, that we may be patient. Let us examine whether there may not be some colour for the slander, and walk watchfully, so as to be clear of all appearances of evil.</body></html>
