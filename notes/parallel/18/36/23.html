While God is thus the universal and all-perfect Teacher, there are some who would fain instruct him, dictate the course which he ought to pursue, improve and amend his universe. Something of this spirit has appeared in Job's remonstrances, which seem to insinuate that the Divine government of the world might be carried on better than it is (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-3.htm">Job 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-20.htm">Job 13:20-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-11.htm">Job 16:11-17</a>, etc.). Elihu's intention is to reprove Job for his presumption. <span class="cmt_word">Or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?</span> Job has not said this; but he has gone near to saying it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-24.htm">Job 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-3.htm">Job 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-2.htm">Job 24:2-12</a>, etc.); compare the comment on Job 34:5-12. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:15-23 Elihu shows that Job caused the continuance of his own trouble. He cautions him not to persist in frowardness. Even good men need to be kept to their duty by the fear of God's wrath; the wisest and best have enough in them to deserve his stroke. Let not Job continue his unjust quarrel with God and his providence. And let us never dare to think favourably of sin, never indulge it, nor allow ourselves in it. Elihu thinks Job needed this caution, he having chosen rather to gratify his pride and humour by contending with God, than to mortify them by submitting, and accepting the punishment. It is absurd for us to think to teach Him who is himself the Fountain of light, truth, knowledge, and instruction. He teaches by the Bible, and that is the best book; teaches by his Son, and he is the best Master. He is just in all proceedings.</body></html>
