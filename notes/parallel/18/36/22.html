He dilates on the power and majesty of God, and appears to be speaking in contemplation of some magnificent natural phenomenon--as the tempest, or hurricane, or whirlwind--out of which the Lord ultimately spake (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-1.htm" title="Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,">Job 38:1</a>). It is probable that this storm was beginning to gather, and that it suggested the glorious imagery of Elihu's speech. The points are that (1) God is the source of greatness; (2) that there is no teacher like Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-22.htm" title="Behold, God exalts by his power: who teaches like him?">Job 36:22</a>); (3) that He is absolute as well as almighty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-23.htm" title="Who has enjoined him his way? or who can say, You have worked iniquity?">Job 36:23</a>); (4) that He is unsearchable and eternal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-26.htm" title="Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.">Job 36:26</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, God exalteth by his power</span>; rather, <span class="accented">behold</span>, <span class="accented">God doeth loftily in his power</span> (see the Revised Version). Who teacheth like him? This has been called "the key-note of Elihu's whole discourse" (Cook). The entire providential government of the world by God he views as didactic, as a series of moral lessons addressed to men by their Maker (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-14.htm">Job 33:14, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-11.htm">Job 35:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-9.htm">Job 36:9</a>, etc.). If the lessons intended are taken to heart, then all goes well with men; if they are rejected, then very sad and terrible results follow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-12.htm">Job 36:12</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:15-23 Elihu shows that Job caused the continuance of his own trouble. He cautions him not to persist in frowardness. Even good men need to be kept to their duty by the fear of God's wrath; the wisest and best have enough in them to deserve his stroke. Let not Job continue his unjust quarrel with God and his providence. And let us never dare to think favourably of sin, never indulge it, nor allow ourselves in it. Elihu thinks Job needed this caution, he having chosen rather to gratify his pride and humour by contending with God, than to mortify them by submitting, and accepting the punishment. It is absurd for us to think to teach Him who is himself the Fountain of light, truth, knowledge, and instruction. He teaches by the Bible, and that is the best book; teaches by his Son, and he is the best Master. He is just in all proceedings.</body></html>
