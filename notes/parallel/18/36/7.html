Under no circumstances does God cease to keep an eye upon the righteous, as Job had seemed to imply when he exclaimed, "Oh that I were as in months of old, in the days when God preserved me!" or "watched me!" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-2.htm">Job 29:2</a>). "The eyes of the Lord are" always "upon the righteous, as his ears are open unto their <span class="accented">cry"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With kings are they on the throne</span>. In some cases, God shows his care of the righteous by "setting them with princes, even with the princes of his people" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/113-8.htm">Psalm 113:8</a>), raising them, that is, to high station, and making them companions of the great of the earth. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted</span>. They are permanently established in their high positions, like Joseph and Mordecai and Daniel; and they are exalted to the highest pitch of prosperity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:5-14 Elihu here shows that God acts as righteous Governor. He is always ready to defend those that are injured. If our eye is ever toward God in duty, his eye will be ever upon us in mercy, and, when we are at the lowest, will not overlook us. God intends, when he afflicts us, to discover past sins to us, and to bring them to our remembrance. Also, to dispose our hearts to be taught: affliction makes people willing to learn, through the grace of God working with and by it. And further, to deter us from sinning for the future. It is a command, to have no more to do with sin. If we faithfully serve God, we have the promise of the life that now is, and the comforts of it, as far as is for God's glory and our good: and who would desire them any further? We have the possession of inward pleasures, the great peace which those have that love God's law. If the affliction fail in its work, let men expect the furnace to be heated till they are consumed. Those that die without knowledge, die without grace, and are undone for ever. See the nature of hypocrisy; it lies in the heart: that is for the world and the flesh, while perhaps the outside seems to be for God and religion. Whether sinners die in youth, or live long to heap up wrath, their case is dreadful. The souls of the wicked live after death, but it is in everlasting misery.</body></html>
