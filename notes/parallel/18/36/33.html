We may translate the first clause, "The noise thereof (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the crash of the thunder) declareth concerning Him:" it is His voice, and speaks of Him; but the last clause is almost unintelligible. The words as they stand mean, or may mean, <span class= "ital">cattle even concerning a goer up; </span>but what this means who shall say? Possibly, <span class= "ital">the thunder-crash telleth the cattle even concerning Him who goeth up: i.e.</span>, even the cattle show, by their terror, that the thunder speaketh to them of God, who goeth up on high. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-9.htm" title="The voice of the LORD makes the hinds to calve, and discovers the forests: and in his temple does every one speak of his glory.">Psalm 29:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-4.htm" title="Sing to God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rides on the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.">Psalm 68:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-18.htm" title="You have ascended on high, you have led captivity captive: you have received gifts for men; yes, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.">Psalm 68:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/47-5.htm" title="God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.">Psalm 47:5</a>.) Some render the last clause, "The cattle also concerning Him as He riseth up;" or, "The cattle also concerning the rising storm." There can be no doubt but that the general meaning is that all nature participateth in the terror caused by the thunder, which is regarded as the audible voice of God; but what the exact expression of this general thought may be it is very hard to say.<p>There should he no break between this chapter and the next.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The noise thereof showeth concerning it;</span> or, <span class="accented">concerning him.</span> The loud crash proclaims the fierceness of God's anger. The cattle also concerning the vapour; rather, <span class="accented">it</span> <span class="accented">sheweth the cattle also concerning him that goeth up</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the very cattle also feel that God is in the storm, rides upon it, and "goeth up" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/47-5.htm">Psalm 47:5</a>). The rendering of the Revised Version, "(it showeth) the cattle also concerning the storm that cometh up," is very weak, and unworthy of such an orator as Elihu. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:24-33 Elihu endeavours to fill Job with high thought of God, and so to persuade him into cheerful submission to his providence. Man may see God's works, and is capable of discerning his hand in them, which the beasts are not, therefore they ought to give him the glory. But while the worker of iniquity ought to tremble, the true believer should rejoice. Children should hear with pleasure their Father's voice, even when he speaks in terror to his enemies. There is no light but there may be a cloud to intercept it. The light of the favour of God, the light of his countenance, the most blessed light of all, even that light has many a cloud. The clouds of our sins cause the Lord to his face, and hinder the light of his loving-kindness from shining on our souls.</body></html>
