He professes very great zeal for God, but it is hard to see that some of his great professions are warranted. For instance, he says--<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-33.</span> - The two chapters, ch. 36. and 37, form a single discourse, and ought not to have been separated; or, at any rate, not so unskilfully as they are, in the middle of a description of a thunderstorm. They constitute a final appeal to Job, who is exhorted to submission, resignation, and patience, in consideration of God's inscrutability, and of his perfect justice, wisdom, and strength. Ch. 36 begins with a short preface (vers. 1-4), in which Elihu seeks to prove his right to offer counsel to Job, after which God's justice is demonstrated (vers. 5-16), and Job warned that his petulance may lead to his complete destruction (vers. 17-25). Finally, in illustration of God's might and unsearchableness' the description of a thunderstorm is commenced (vers. 26-33), which is carried on into the next chapter. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Elihu also proceeded, and said, Suffer me a little, and I will show thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf</span>; literally, <span class="accented">that there are yet words for God.</span> The controversy, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, is not exhausted; there is yet much that may be urged on God's behalf, in respect of the charges thou hast made against him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:1-4 Elihu only maintained that the affliction was sent for his trial; and lengthened because Job was not yet thoroughly humbled under it. He sought to ascribe righteousness to his Maker; to clear this truth, that God is righteous in all his ways. Such knowledge must be learned from the word and Spirit of God, for naturally we are estranged from it. The fitness of Elihu's discourse to the dispute between Job and his friends is plain. It pointed out to Job the true reason of those trials with which he had been pointed out to Job the true reason of those trials with which he had been visited. It taught that God had acted in mercy towards him, and the spiritual benefit he was to derive from them. It corrected the mistake of his friends, and showed that Job's calamities were for good.</body></html>
