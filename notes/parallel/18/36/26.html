It is suggested that the storm, which ultimately broke at the theophania (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-1.htm">Job 38:1</a>), was already beginning to gather, and turned the thoughts of Elihu in this direction. He begins with the consideration of how rain is generated, passes rapidly to the gathering of the clouds from all quarters, and thence to the loud crashing of the thunder, and the dazzling flashes of the lightning, which illumine even the lowest depths of the sea (ver. 30). The effects of the storm are then spoken of, in words the exact meaning of which is very obscure (vers. 31-33). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, God is great, and we know him not</span>. This is the final lesson which Elihu seeks to impress on his hearers. God is so great their fully to comprehend him transcends the power of the human understanding. However much we know of him, there is more that we do not know. His nature is unsearchable; his depths (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>) are inscrutable; try as we may, we can never "find him out" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-23.htm">Job 37:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Neither can the number of his years be searched out</span>. Even his duration, being eternal, is beyond us. We cannot realize the thought of pre- and post-eternity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:24-33 Elihu endeavours to fill Job with high thought of God, and so to persuade him into cheerful submission to his providence. Man may see God's works, and is capable of discerning his hand in them, which the beasts are not, therefore they ought to give him the glory. But while the worker of iniquity ought to tremble, the true believer should rejoice. Children should hear with pleasure their Father's voice, even when he speaks in terror to his enemies. There is no light but there may be a cloud to intercept it. The light of the favour of God, the light of his countenance, the most blessed light of all, even that light has many a cloud. The clouds of our sins cause the Lord to his face, and hinder the light of his loving-kindness from shining on our souls.</body></html>
