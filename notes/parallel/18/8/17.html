Even if transplanted, this luxuriant tree will flourish equally well in another soil.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth</span> (rather, <span class="accented">he seeth</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the place</span> (literally, house) <span class="cmt_word">of stones</span>. This passage is very obscure The word <span class="accented">gal</span>, translated heap, means sometimes a spring or stream of water (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-12.htm">Song of Solomon 4:12</a>); and many of the best Hebraists regard it as having that meaning here (Buxtorf, Lee, Stanley Leathes, Revised Version). In this case we have to regard the rapidly growing plant as having its roots wrapped about the perennial spring, which was a not uncommon, and always a much-desired, feature of an Eastern garden. Thus nourished, it naturally increased and spread itself, and "was green before the sun." May we suppose that it "saw the house of stones," because the spring which nourished it gushed forth from the native rock so that its roots were in contact with both? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:8-19 Bildad discourses well of hypocrites and evil-doers, and the fatal end of all their hopes and joys. He proves this truth of the destruction of the hopes and joys of hypocrites, by an appeal to former times. Bildad refers to the testimony of the ancients. Those teach best that utter words out of their heart, that speak from an experience of spiritual and divine things. A rush growing in fenny ground, looking very green, but withering in dry weather, represents the hypocrite's profession, which is maintained only in times of prosperity. The spider's web, spun with great skill, but easily swept away, represents a man's pretensions to religion when without the grace of God in his heart. A formal professor flatters himself in his own eyes, doubts not of his salvation, is secure, and cheats the world with his vain confidences. The flourishing of the tree, planted in the garden, striking root to the rock, yet after a time cut down and thrown aside, represents wicked men, when most firmly established, suddenly thrown down and forgotten. This doctrine of the vanity of a hypocrite's confidence, or the prosperity of a wicked man, is sound; but it was not applicable to the case of Job, if confined to the present world.</body></html>
