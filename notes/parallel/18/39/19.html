It includes courage and all martial excellence. <span class="cmt_word">Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?</span> Many objections have been taken to this expression; and endeavours have been made to show that the word used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) does not mean "thunder," but" a tremulous motion," "quivering muscles and a tossing mane," or else "scorn," "indignation." But as <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> <span class="accented">always</span> means "thunder" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-14.htm">Job 26:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-25.htm">Job 39:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-19.htm">Psalm 77:19</a>: 81:8; 145:7; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-6.htm">Isaiah 29:6</a>), it seems unlikely that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5d4;</span> means anything else. To the objection that the metaphor is "incongruous" (Professor Lee), it would appear to be enough to reply that one of our greatest prose-poets has seen in it peculiar fitness. <span class="accented">So true every way</span>" says Carlyle, on the passage: "true eyesight and vision for all things; material things, not less than spiritual; "the horse - Hast thou clothed his neck with <span class="accented">thunder?</span>" ('Lectures on Heroes,' p. 78). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/39.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>39:1-30 God inquires of Job concerning several animals. - In these questions the Lord continued to humble Job. In this chapter several animals are spoken of, whose nature or situation particularly show the power, wisdom, and manifold works of God. The wild ass. It is better to labour and be good for something, than to ramble and be good for nothing. From the untameableness of this and other creatures, we may see, how unfit we are to give law to Providence, who cannot give law even to a wild ass's colt. The unicorn, a strong, stately, proud creature. He is able to serve, but not willing; and God challenges Job to force him to it. It is a great mercy if, where God gives strength for service, he gives a heart; it is what we should pray for, and reason ourselves into, which the brutes cannot do. Those gifts are not always the most valuable that make the finest show. Who would not rather have the voice of the nightingale, than the tail of the peacock; the eye of the eagle and her soaring wing, and the natural affection of the stork, than the beautiful feathers of the ostrich, which can never rise above the earth, and is without natural affection? The description of the war-horse helps to explain the character of presumptuous sinners. Every one turneth to his course, as the horse rushes into the battle. When a man's heart is fully set in him to do evil, and he is carried on in a wicked way, by the violence of his appetites and passions, there is no making him fear the wrath of God, and the fatal consequences of sin. Secure sinners think themselves as safe in their sins as the eagle in her nest on high, in the clefts of the rocks; but I will bring thee down from thence, saith the Lord, #Jer 49:16". All these beautiful references to the works of nature, should teach us a right view of the riches of the wisdom of Him who made and sustains all things. The want of right views concerning the wisdom of God, which is ever present in all things, led Job to think and speak unworthily of Providence.</body></html>
