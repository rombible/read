The writer was probably familiar with Egypt when the Nile, which is still called the sea, was carefully watched and guarded by dykes that its overflow might not destroy the land. So Job exclaims, "Am I like the sea, or one of its monsters--like that Leviathan which Thou hast made to take his pastime therein, that Thou keepest guard over me and makest me thy prisoner continually, shutting me up on every side so fast in prison that I cannot get free?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - Job now begins his complaint, which is wholly addressed to God. The heads of it are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that he is confined and restrained, allowed no liberty (ver. 12); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that he is terrified by visions in the night (vers. 13, 14); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that he is not "let alone" (ver. 16); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that so much attention is paid to him (vers. 17-19); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> that he is made a butt for God's arrows (ver. 20); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> that he is not pardoned, but relentlessly persecuted (ver. 21). <span class="cmt_word">Am I a sea, or a whale?</span> rather, <span class="accented">Am I a sea</span> <span class="accented">or a sea-monster</span>? Am I as wild and uncontrollable as the ocean, as fierce and savage as a crocodile or other monster of the deep? Do I not possess reason and conscience, by which I might be directed and guided? Why, then, am I treated as if I were without them? The sea must be watched, lest it break in upon the land; in Egypt there had been many such breaches, as the configuration of the coast, with its narrow belts of sand and its vast lagoons, shows; and crocodiles must be watched, lest they destroy human life; but is there any need that I should be watched, restrained, coerced, hedged in on every side (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-23.htm">Job 3:23</a>)? Am I so dangerous? Surely not.

Dying is done but once, and therefore it had need be well done. An error here is past retrieve. Other clouds arise, but the same cloud never returns: so a new generation of men is raised up, but the former generation vanishes away. Glorified saints shall return no more to the cares and sorrows of their houses; nor condemned sinners to the gaieties and pleasures of their houses. It concerns us to secure a better place when we die. From these reasons Job might have drawn a better conclusion than this, I will complain. When we have but a few breaths to draw, we should spend them in the holy, gracious breathings of faith and prayer; not in the noisome, noxious breathings of sin and corruption. We have much reason to pray, that He who keeps Israel, and neither slumbers nor sleeps, may keep us when we slumber and sleep. Job covets to rest in his grave. Doubtless, this was his infirmity; for though a good man would choose death rather than sin, yet he should be content to live as long as God pleases, because life is our opportunity of glorifying him, and preparing for heaven.</body></html>
