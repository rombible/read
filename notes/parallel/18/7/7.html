The wind is an image of all that is vain, shifting, unstable, ready to pass away (Job 6:36; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-29.htm">Proverbs 11:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-18.htm">Isaiah 26:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-9.htm">Isaiah 41:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-13.htm">Jeremiah 5:13</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Mine eye shall no more see good</span>. Another protest against the hopes flint Eliphaz has held out (see the comment on ver. 6; and setup, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-25.htm">Job 9:25</a>). Job is still speaking of this life only, and not touching the question of another. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:7-16 Plain truths as to the shortness and vanity of man's life, and the certainty of death, do us good, when we think and speak of them with application to ourselves. Dying is done but once, and therefore it had need be well done. An error here is past retrieve. Other clouds arise, but the same cloud never returns: so a new generation of men is raised up, but the former generation vanishes away. Glorified saints shall return no more to the cares and sorrows of their houses; nor condemned sinners to the gaieties and pleasures of their houses. It concerns us to secure a better place when we die. From these reasons Job might have drawn a better conclusion than this, I will complain. When we have but a few breaths to draw, we should spend them in the holy, gracious breathings of faith and prayer; not in the noisome, noxious breathings of sin and corruption. We have much reason to pray, that He who keeps Israel, and neither slumbers nor sleeps, may keep us when we slumber and sleep. Job covets to rest in his grave. Doubtless, this was his infirmity; for though a good man would choose death rather than sin, yet he should be content to live as long as God pleases, because life is our opportunity of glorifying him, and preparing for heaven.</body></html>
