Our Lord has not discouraged the belief when He has taught us that His miracle of healing the paralytic was accompanied with the assurance of forgiveness (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-2.htm" title="And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said to the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; your sins be forgiven you.">Matthew 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-5.htm" title="When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the sick of the palsy, Son, your sins be forgiven you.">Mark 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-20.htm" title="And when he saw their faith, he said to him, Man, your sins are forgiven you.">Luke 5:20</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity?</span> Job feels that, if he has sinned, which he is ready to admit as possible, though he has certainly no deep conviction of sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-24.htm">Job 6:24, 29, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-19.htm">Job 7:19</a>), at any rate he has not sinned greatly, heinously; and therefore he cannot understand why he has not been forgiven. The idea that the Almighty cannot forgive sin except upon conditions, is unknown to him. Believing God to be a God of mercy, he regards him also, just as Nehemiah did, as a "God of pardons" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-17.htm">Nehemiah 9:17</a>) - a belief which seems to have been instinctive with men of all nations. And it appears to him unaccountable that pardon has not been extended to himself. Like his "comforters." he makes the mistake of supposing that all his afflictions have been penal, are signs of God's displeasure, and intended to crush and destroy him. He has not woke up to the difference between God's punishments and his chastisements. Apparently, he does not know that "whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth," or that men are "made perfect through sufferings" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For now shall I sleep in the dust.</span> Now it is too late for pardon to avail anything. Death is nigh at hand. The final blow must soon be struck. <span class="cmt_word">And thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be</span>. The idea seems to be - God will relent at last; he will seek to alleviate my sufferings; he will search for me diligently - but I shall have ceased to be. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:17-21 Job reasons with God concerning his dealings with man. But in the midst of this discourse, Job seems to have lifted up his thoughts to God with some faith and hope. Observe the concern he is in about his sins. The best men have to complain of sin; and the better they are, the more they will complain of it. God is the Preserver of our lives, and the Saviour of the souls of all that believe; but probably Job meant the Observer of men, whose eyes are upon the ways and hearts of all men. We can hide nothing from Him; let us plead guilty before his throne of grace, that we may not be condemned at his judgment-seat. Job maintained, against his friends, that he was not a hypocrite, not a wicked man, yet he owns to his God, that he had sinned. The best must so acknowledge, before the Lord. He seriously inquires how he might be at peace with God, and earnestly begs forgiveness of his sins. He means more than the removing of his outward trouble, and is earnest for the return of God's favour. Wherever the Lord removes the guilt of sin, he breaks the power of sin. To strengthen his prayer for pardon, Job pleads the prospect he had of dying quickly. If my sins be not pardoned while I live, I am lost and undone for ever. How wretched is sinful man without a knowledge of the Saviour!</body></html>
