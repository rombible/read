At any rate, it is the frequent experience of the wicked who lose their ill-gotten gains, and are brought down to abject poverty, and actual want of the necessaries of life. "He wanders abroad <span class="accented">to be the food of vultures"</span> is a translation of the passage suggested by some moderns (as Merx), and has the support of the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>. But it requires a slight change in the pointing. <span class="cmt_word">He knoweth that the day of darkness is nigh at hand</span>. "The day of darkness" is probably the day of his decease: this he "knows," or at any rate, surmises, to be near. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:17-35 Eliphaz maintains that the wicked are certainly miserable: whence he would infer, that the miserable are certainly wicked, and therefore Job was so. But because many of God's people have prospered in this world, it does not therefore follow that those who are crossed and made poor, as Job, are not God's people. Eliphaz shows also that wicked people, particularly oppressors, are subject to continual terror, live very uncomfortably, and perish very miserably. Will the prosperity of presumptuous sinners end miserably as here described? Then let the mischiefs which befal others, be our warnings. Though no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous, nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruits of righteousness to them that are exercised thereby. No calamity, no trouble, however heavy, however severe, can rob a follower of the Lord of his favour. What shall separate him from the love of Christ?</body></html>
