"Because he <span class= "ital">hath stretched </span>out his hand against God. and <span class= "ital">behaveth </span>himself proudly against the Almighty. He runneth upon Him with haughty neck, with the thick bosses of his bucklers; "fully protected as he supposes against the vengeance of the Most High. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-6.htm" title="He has said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity.">Psalm 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-11.htm" title="He has said in his heart, God has forgotten: he hides his face; he will never see it.">Psalm 10:11</a>, &c.) The English version, with less probability, represents the armour as being God's; on the contrary, it is the wicked man's prosperity which hath thus blinded and hardened him. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm" title="But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: you are waxen fat, you are grown thick, you are covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-10.htm" title="They are enclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.">Psalm 17:10</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he stretcheth out his hand against God</span>. The wicked man ventures even to threaten the Almighty. So in Eastern legend Nimrod was supposed to have done, and in Greek legend the giants. <span class="cmt_word">And strengtheneth himself against the Almighty</span>; rather, <span class="accented">behaveth himself proudly. See</span> the Revised Version, and compare Schultens, who renders the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5d2;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, by "ferocius et insolentius se gessit." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:17-35 Eliphaz maintains that the wicked are certainly miserable: whence he would infer, that the miserable are certainly wicked, and therefore Job was so. But because many of God's people have prospered in this world, it does not therefore follow that those who are crossed and made poor, as Job, are not God's people. Eliphaz shows also that wicked people, particularly oppressors, are subject to continual terror, live very uncomfortably, and perish very miserably. Will the prosperity of presumptuous sinners end miserably as here described? Then let the mischiefs which befal others, be our warnings. Though no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous, nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruits of righteousness to them that are exercised thereby. No calamity, no trouble, however heavy, however severe, can rob a follower of the Lord of his favour. What shall separate him from the love of Christ?</body></html>
