The Authorised Version gives very good sense, which seems to suit the context in the following verse; but it is susceptible of other phases of meaning: <span class= "ital">e.g</span>., "or a word that dealeth gently with thee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-5.htm" title="And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.">2Samuel 4:5</a>), such as ours have been (?)"; or "the word that he hath spoken softly with thee" (but see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-8.htm" title="Have you heard the secret of God? and do you restrain wisdom to yourself?">Job 15:8</a>); or, again, the consolations of God may mean strong consolations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-11.htm" title="She sent out her boughs to the sea, and her branches to the river.">Psalm 80:11</a>), such as ours have been, spoken in strong language," in which case the second clause would mean, "Was thine own speech gentle?" "Small with thee" means, of course, <span class= "ital">too small for thee.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Are the consolations of God small with thee?</span> By "the consolations of God" Eliphaz probably means the hopes which he and his friends had held out, speaking in God's Name, that if Job would humble himself, and confess his guilt, and sue to God for pardon, he would be restored to favour, recover his prosperity, and live to a good old age in tranquil happiness (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-18.htm">Job 5:18-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-20.htm">Job 8:20-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-13.htm">Job 11:13-19</a>). He wishes to know if Job thinks lightly of all this, regards it as of small account, will make no effort to obtain the blessings held out to him. This is all reasonable enough from his standpoint, that Job is conscious of secret heinous guilt; but it can make no impression on Job, who is conscious of the reverse. <span class="cmt_word">Is there any secret thing with thee?</span> rather, <span class="accented">And is the word</span> [<span class="accented">of small account that dealeth</span>] <span class="accented">gently with thee?</span> Eliphaz considers that his own words and those of his two companions have been soft words, dealing "gently" with Job's refractoriness, and that Job ought to have been impressed by them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-16 Eliphaz begins a second attack upon Job, instead of being softened by his complaints. He unjustly charges Job with casting off the fear of God, and all regard to him, and restraining prayer. See in what religion is summed up, fearing God, and praying to him; the former the most needful principle, the latter the most needful practice. Eliphaz charges Job with self-conceit. He charges him with contempt of the counsels and comforts given him by his friends. We are apt to think that which we ourselves say is important, when others, with reason, think little of it. He charges him with opposition to God. Eliphaz ought not to have put harsh constructions upon the words of one well known for piety, and now in temptation. It is plain that these disputants were deeply convinced of the doctrine of original sin, and the total depravity of human nature. Shall we not admire the patience of God in bearing with us? and still more his love to us in the redemption of Christ Jesus his beloved Son?</body></html>
