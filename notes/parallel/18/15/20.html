Here, again, we have a highly-coloured and poetical description of the oppressor, true to the character of the speaker in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-12.htm" title="Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a little thereof.">Job 4:12</a>, &c. We should read <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-20.htm" title="The wicked man travails with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.">Job 15:20</a> : <span class= "ital">The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor. </span>It is not an independent statement, as in the Authorised Version. A sound of terror is for ever in his ears lest the spoiler should come upon him in his prosperity--he always seems to dread his war-swoop. And this condition of darkness within, which contrasts so painfully with his outward prosperity, he sees no escape from; he is over in fear of a sword hanging over him, like Damocles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-35.</span> - Schultens calls this "a magnificently elaborate oration, crowded with illustrations and metaphors, in which it is shown that the wicked cannot possibly escape being miserable, but that the punishment which they have so richly deserved assuredly awaits them, and is to be inflicted on them, as an example and terror to others, by a holy and just God, because, just as he loves virtue, so he pursues vice with a fierce and deadly hatred" ('Liber Jobi,' p. 104, edit. R. Grey). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days</span>. Certainly an over-statement of the truth. With a much nearer approach to the facts of the case, the Psalmist remarked, "I was grieved at the wicked: I do also see the ungodly in such prosperity. For they are in no peril of death, but are lusty and strong. They come in no misfortune like other folk; neither are they plagued like other men" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3-5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the number of years is hidden to the oppressor</span>; rather, <span class="accented">even the number of years that is laid up for the oppressor.</span> So Merx and the Revised Version. Another possible meaning is, "And a [small] number of years is laid up," etc. If we take the former view, we must regard the clause as exegetical of "all his days." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:17-35 Eliphaz maintains that the wicked are certainly miserable: whence he would infer, that the miserable are certainly wicked, and therefore Job was so. But because many of God's people have prospered in this world, it does not therefore follow that those who are crossed and made poor, as Job, are not God's people. Eliphaz shows also that wicked people, particularly oppressors, are subject to continual terror, live very uncomfortably, and perish very miserably. Will the prosperity of presumptuous sinners end miserably as here described? Then let the mischiefs which befal others, be our warnings. Though no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous, nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruits of righteousness to them that are exercised thereby. No calamity, no trouble, however heavy, however severe, can rob a follower of the Lord of his favour. What shall separate him from the love of Christ?</body></html>
