Eliphaz had asserted the same truth in his first speech, when he said, "Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his Maker? Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he taxeth with folly: <span class="accented">how m</span>u<span class="accented">ch less in them that dwell in houses of clay</span> whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-17.htm">Job 4:17-19</a>); and Job had given his full assent to it, when he exclaimed, "I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God? If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2, 3</a>). The true question was not whether Job or any other man was" clean," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> wholly <span class="accented">sinless</span> but whether Job had sinned so deeply and grievously that his sufferings were the natural and just punishment for his sins. And a mere repetition of the statement that all men were sinful and unclean was off the <span class="accented">point - nihil ad rem-</span>altogether futile and superfluous. <span class="cmt_word">And he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</span> (setup. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/25-4.htm">Job 25:4</a>). The clause is a mere variant of the preceding one. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-16 Eliphaz begins a second attack upon Job, instead of being softened by his complaints. He unjustly charges Job with casting off the fear of God, and all regard to him, and restraining prayer. See in what religion is summed up, fearing God, and praying to him; the former the most needful principle, the latter the most needful practice. Eliphaz charges Job with self-conceit. He charges him with contempt of the counsels and comforts given him by his friends. We are apt to think that which we ourselves say is important, when others, with reason, think little of it. He charges him with opposition to God. Eliphaz ought not to have put harsh constructions upon the words of one well known for piety, and now in temptation. It is plain that these disputants were deeply convinced of the doctrine of original sin, and the total depravity of human nature. Shall we not admire the patience of God in bearing with us? and still more his love to us in the redemption of Christ Jesus his beloved Son?</body></html>
