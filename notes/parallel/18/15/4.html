To Eliphaz, Job's words - his bold expostulations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3, 15, 22</a>, etc.), his declarations that he <span class="accented">knows</span> he will be justified (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-8.htm">Job 13:8</a>), and that God will be his Salvation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-16.htm">Job 13:16</a>) - seem to imply that he has cast off altogether the fear of God, and is entirely devoid of reverence. Some of his expressions certainly seem over-bold; but, on the other hand, his sense of God's purity, perfectness, and transcendent power is continually manifest, and should have saved him from the rude reproach here launched against him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-1.htm">Job 9:1-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-24.htm">Job 12:24</a> 25; 13:11, 21, etc.). And restrainest prayer before God; rather, <span class="accented">and hinderest devout meditation</span> before God. Eliphaz means that Job expresses himself in a way so cf. fensive to devout souls, that he disturbs their minds and prevents them from indulging in those pious meditations on the Divine goodness which would otherwise occupy them (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-97.htm">Psalm 119:97</a>). Thus, according to Eliphaz, Job is not only irreligious himself, but the cause of irreligion in others. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-16 Eliphaz begins a second attack upon Job, instead of being softened by his complaints. He unjustly charges Job with casting off the fear of God, and all regard to him, and restraining prayer. See in what religion is summed up, fearing God, and praying to him; the former the most needful principle, the latter the most needful practice. Eliphaz charges Job with self-conceit. He charges him with contempt of the counsels and comforts given him by his friends. We are apt to think that which we ourselves say is important, when others, with reason, think little of it. He charges him with opposition to God. Eliphaz ought not to have put harsh constructions upon the words of one well known for piety, and now in temptation. It is plain that these disputants were deeply convinced of the doctrine of original sin, and the total depravity of human nature. Shall we not admire the patience of God in bearing with us? and still more his love to us in the redemption of Christ Jesus his beloved Son?</body></html>
