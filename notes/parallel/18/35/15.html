The Authorised Version refers the first clause to God and the second to Job. Perhaps we may render, <span class= "ital">But now, what His anger has visited upon thee is as nothing </span>(compared with thy deserts); <span class= "ital">yea, He hath not regarded the great abundance </span>(of thy sin), <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, hath not visited it with anger. <span class= "ital">Therefore doth Job, </span>&c. Others render it, "But now, because it is not so (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>there is no judgment), He hath visited in His anger, <span class= "ital">saith Job, </span>and He regardeth it not, <span class= "ital">saith He, </span>in His exceeding arrogance;" or, "But now, because He hath not visited in His anger, neither doth He much regard arrogance, therefore Job," &c. The word thus rendered <span class= "ital">arrogance </span>is not found elsewhere; it appears to mean abundance or superfluity. Of these renderings, the first seems to give the better sense. The general bearing of the verse is perhaps apparent however rendered, namely, that Job is encouraged in his murmurings, because God hath dealt too leniently with him. Elihu's reproaches must have been some of the heaviest that Job had to bear. Happily the judgment was not to be long deferred. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-1.htm" title="Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,">Job 38:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15, 16.</span> - Leaving his advice to sink into Job's mind, Elihu turns from him to the bystanders, and remarks, with some severity, that it is because Job has not been punished enough, because God has not visited him for his petulance and arrogance, that he indulges in "high swelling words of vanity," and continues to utter words which are foolish and" without knowledge." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger</span>. This is an impossible rendering. The Hebrew is perfectly plain, and is to be translated literally as follows: <span class="accented">But now</span>, <span class="accented">because he hath not visited his</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Job's) <span class="accented">anger</span>. (So Schultens, Canon Cook, and, with a slight difference, our Revisers.) God had not visited Job with any fresh afflictions on account of his vehement expostulations and overbold and reckless words. Yet he knoweth it not in great extremity. The Authorized Version again wholly misses the meaning. Translate, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">Neither doth he greatly regard</span> (Job's) <span class="accented">arrogance.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:14-26 As in prosperity we are ready to think our mountain will never be brought low; so when in adversity, we are ready to think our valley will never be filled up. But to conclude that to-morrow must be as this day, is as absurd as to think that the weather, when either fair or foul, will be always so. When Job looked up to God, he had no reason to speak despairingly. There is a day of judgment, when all that seems amiss will be found to be right, and all that seems dark and difficult will be cleared up and set straight. And if there is Divine wrath in our troubles, it is because we quarrel with God, are fretful, and distrust Divine Providence. This was Job's case. Elihu was directed by God to humble Job, for as to some things he had both opened his mouth in vain, and had multiplied words without knowledge. Let us be admonished, in our afflictions, not so much to set forth the greatness of our suffering, as the greatness of the mercy of God.</body></html>
