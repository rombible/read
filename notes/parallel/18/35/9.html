Elihu answers that Job's case is not exceptional. Those who cry out against oppression and suffering frequently receive no answer, but it is because they "ask amiss." Job should have patience and trust. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry</span>; rather, <span class="accented">by reason</span> <span class="accented">of the multitude of oppressions</span>, <span class="accented">men cry out.</span> It is not Job only who cries to God. Oppressors are numerous; the oppressed are numerous; everywhere there are complaints and outcries. They cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty. The oppressors are, for the most part, the mighty of the earth - kings, princes, nobles (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-10.htm">Hosea 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-1.htm">Amos 4:1</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:9-13 Job complained that God did not regard the cries of the oppressed against their oppressors. This he knew not how to reconcile the justice of God and his government. Elihu solves the difficulty. Men do not notice the mercies they enjoy in and under their afflictions, nor are thankful for them, therefore they cannot expect that God should deliver them out of affliction. He gives songs in the night; when our condition is dark and melancholy, there is that in God's providence and promise, which is sufficient to support us, and to enable us even to rejoice in tribulation. When we only pore upon our afflictions, and neglect the consolations of God which are treasured up for us, it is just in God to reject our prayers. Even the things that will kill the body, cannot hurt the soul. If we cry to God for the removal of an affliction, and it is not removed, the reason is, not because the Lord's hand is shortened, or his ear heavy; but because we are not sufficiently humbled.</body></html>
