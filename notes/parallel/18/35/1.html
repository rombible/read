Finally (verb. 15, 16), he condemns Job for haughtiness and arrogance, and reiterates the charge that he "multiplies words without knowledge" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-35.htm">Job 34:35-37</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Elihu spake moreover, and said, Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?</span> Once more it is to be observed that Job had said no such thing. At the worst, he had made statements from which it might be argued that he regarded himself as having a more delicate sense of justice than God (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-3.htm">Job 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-6.htm">Job 12:6</a>, etc.). But Elihu insists on pushing Job's intemperate phrases to their extremest logical issues, and taxing Job with having <span class="accented">said</span> all that his words might seem to a strict logician to involve (compare the comment on Job 34:5, 9). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:1-8 Elihu reproves Job for justifying himself more than God, and called his attention to the heavens. They are far above us, and God is far above them; how much then is he out of the reach, either of our sins or of our services! We have no reason to complain if we have not what we expect, but should be thankful that we have better than we deserve.</body></html>
