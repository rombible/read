It is indeed true that God is too high to be affected by man's righteousness or unrighteousness, but it does not follow therefore that He is indifferent, for then He would not be a righteous judge.

Elihu has pledged himself to confute their reasonings, no less than those of Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-5.htm">Job 32:5-20</a>), and now proposes to carry out this intention. But it is not very clear that he accomplish, s his purpose. In point of fact, he does little more than repeat and expand the argument of Eliphaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-2.htm">Job 22:2, 3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:1-8 Elihu reproves Job for justifying himself more than God, and called his attention to the heavens. They are far above us, and God is far above them; how much then is he out of the reach, either of our sins or of our services! We have no reason to complain if we have not what we expect, but should be thankful that we have better than we deserve.</body></html>
