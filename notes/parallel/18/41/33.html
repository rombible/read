He seeth every high thing, and is king over all the proud beasts. To Him then I say (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-8.htm" title="Lay your hand on him, remember the battle, do no more.">Job 41:8</a>), Lay thine hand upon him; remember the battle, and do so no more. Lo! his hope is deceived. Is he indeed cast down at the very eight of him? He is not so cruel to himself that he should rouse him up. Who then can stand before me? Who hath first given to me, that I should have to repay him? That which is under the whole heavens is mine." It cannot be denied that this makes very good sense, but it seems to be too great a liberty to take with the text as we find it to adopt this as the true order of the verses; for in that case, what is there that we might not deal with in a like manner? Those who advocate this transposition in the order of the verses would also place <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/40-1.htm" title="Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,">Job 40:1-5</a> so as to follow <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-6.htm" title="Then answered the LORD to Job out of the whirlwind, and said,">Job 40:6</a>, in this manner: "Then Job answered the Lord and said, I know that thou canst do everything, and that no purpose can be withholden from thee, or that no purpose of thine can be restrained." Then the next words come in as the implied answer of God: "Who is this that hideth my counsel for want of knowledge?" To which Job replies: "Therefore (I confess that) I have uttered without understanding things too wonderful for me, which I knew not." Again God replies, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-3.htm" title="Gird up now your loins like a man; for I will demand of you, and answer you me.">Job 38:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-7.htm" title="Gird up your loins now like a man: I will demand of you, and declare you to me.">Job 40:7</a> : "Hear, I beseech thee and I will speak, I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me; to which Job answers: "I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor what I have said, and repent it in dust and ashes." Then the Lord answered Job and said, "Is he that contended with the Almighty reproved? Does he acknowledge his discomfiture? He that argueth with God, let him answer this question." Then Job answered the Lord and said, "Behold I am vile. What shall I answer thee? I lay my hand before my mouth; once I have spoken, but I will not answer; yea twice, but I will not do so again." There is a certain amount of sharpness and point obtained in thus making this confession the climax of the poem, and a kind of formal consistency is secured in regarding this resolution as Job's last utterance instead of making him speak again, as he does, according to the present order, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-2.htm" title="I know that you can do every thing, and that no thought can be withheld from you.">Job 42:2</a>. But this consistency is formal rather than real, inasmuch as there is no inconsistency in the <span class= "ital">tone </span>of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-2.htm" title="I know that you can do every thing, and that no thought can be withheld from you.">Job 42:2</a> <span class= "ital">seqq., </span>and the promise of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-5.htm" title="Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yes, twice; but I will proceed no further.">Job 40:5</a>. Whatever advantage may be derived from the re-arrangement will be a matter for individual taste rather to decide, which will vary with the individual; and at all events, the climax of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-6.htm" title="Why I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.">Job 42:6</a> as it stands is a very noble one, and we may question whether we can heighten its grandeur.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear</span> (comp. vers. 24-29). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/41.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>41:1-34 Concerning Leviathan. - The description of the Leviathan, is yet further to convince Job of his own weakness, and of God's almighty power. Whether this Leviathan be a whale or a crocodile, is disputed. The Lord, having showed Job how unable he was to deal with the Leviathan, sets forth his own power in that mighty creature. If such language describes the terrible force of Leviathan, what words can express the power of God's wrath? Under a humbling sense of our own vileness, let us revere the Divine Majesty; take and fill our allotted place, cease from our own wisdom, and give all glory to our gracious God and Saviour. Remembering from whom every good gift cometh, and for what end it was given, let us walk humbly with the Lord.</body></html>
