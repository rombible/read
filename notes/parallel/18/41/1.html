It forms, however, a fit climax to the gradually more and more elaborate descriptions of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-39.htm">Job 38:39-41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-1.htm">Job 39:1-30</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-15.htm">Job 40:15-24</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook?</span> The word <span class="accented">leviathan</span>, or more properly <span class="accented">livyathan</span>, which has previously occurred in ch. 3:8, and is found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-14.htm">Psalm 74:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-26.htm">Psalm 104:26</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>, seems to be derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5d9;</span>, "twisting," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5df;</span>, "a monster," whence the <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> of the Pentateuch and also of Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-12.htm">Job 7:12</a>), Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-11.htm">Jeremiah 9:11</a>), and Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>). It is thus a descriptive epithet rather than a name, and has not unnaturally been used to designate more than one kind of animal. The best modern critics regard it as applied sometimes to a python or large serpent, sometimes to a cetacean, a whale or grampus, and sometimes, as hero, to the crocodile. This last application is now almost universally accepted. The crocodile was fished for by the Egyptians with a hook, and in the time of Herodotus was frequently caught and killed (Herod., 2:70); but probably in Job's day no one had been so venturous as to attack him. <span class="cmt_word">Or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?</span> rather, or press <span class="accented">down his tongue with a cord?</span> (see the Revised Version); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "tie a rope round his lower jaw, and so press down his tongue." Many savage animals are represented in the Assyrian sculptures as led along by a rope attached to their mouths. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/41.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>41:1-34 Concerning Leviathan. - The description of the Leviathan, is yet further to convince Job of his own weakness, and of God's almighty power. Whether this Leviathan be a whale or a crocodile, is disputed. The Lord, having showed Job how unable he was to deal with the Leviathan, sets forth his own power in that mighty creature. If such language describes the terrible force of Leviathan, what words can express the power of God's wrath? Under a humbling sense of our own vileness, let us revere the Divine Majesty; take and fill our allotted place, cease from our own wisdom, and give all glory to our gracious God and Saviour. Remembering from whom every good gift cometh, and for what end it was given, let us walk humbly with the Lord.</body></html>
