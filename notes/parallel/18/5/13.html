For it is written, He takes the wise in their own craftiness.">1Corinthians 3:19</a>): "The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness." The word rendered "froward" means <span class= "ital">crooked, perverse, </span>or <span class= "ital">tortuous. </span>The name Naphtali is derived from the same root (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-8.htm" title="And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.">Genesis 30:8</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He taketh the wise in their own craftiness</span>. Men are, as Shakespeare says, "hoist with their own petard." They "fall into their own nets together" (Psalm 141:11), while the godly, their intended prey, "escape them." And this is God's doing - it is his providence which brings it to pass. And the counsel of the froward is carried headlong; or, "put to confusion" (Lee). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:6-16 Eliphaz reminds Job, that no affliction comes by chance, nor is to be placed to second causes. The difference between prosperity and adversity is not so exactly observed, as that between day and night, summer and winter; but it is according to the will and counsel of God. We must not attribute our afflictions to fortune, for they are from God; nor our sins to fate, for they are from ourselves. Man is born in sin, and therefore born to trouble. There is nothing in this world we are born to, and can truly call our own, but sin and trouble. Actual transgressions are sparks that fly out of the furnace of original corruption. Such is the frailty of our bodies, and the vanity of all our enjoyments, that our troubles arise thence as the sparks fly upward; so many are they, and so fast does one follow another. Eliphaz reproves Job for not seeking God, instead of quarrelling with him. Is any afflicted? let him pray. It is heart's ease, a salve for every sore. Eliphaz speaks of rain, which we are apt to look upon as a little thing; but if we consider how it is produced, and what is produced by it, we shall see it to be a great work of power and goodness. Too often the great Author of all our comforts, and the manner in which they are conveyed to us, are not noticed, because they are received as things of course. In the ways of Providence, the experiences of some are encouragements to others, to hope the best in the worst of times; for it is the glory of God to send help to the helpless, and hope to the hopeless. And daring sinners are confounded, and forced to acknowledge the justice of God's proceedings.</body></html>
