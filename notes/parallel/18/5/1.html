He insinuates that Job is <span class= "ital">"</span>unwise" and "silly," and promises swift destruction for all such.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-27.</span> - Eliphaz, having narrated his vision, and rehearsed the words which the spirit spoke in his ear, continues in his own person, first (vers. 1-7) covertly reproaching Job, and then (vers. 8-27) seeking to comfort him by the suggestion that, if he will place himself unreservedly in the hands of God, it is still possible that God may relent, remove his chastening hand, deliver him from his troubles, and even give him back all his former prosperity. The anticipation is in remarkable accordance with the ultimate event (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10-17</a>), and shows that Eliphaz, if not a prophet in the higher sense, is at least a sagacious interpreter of God's ways with men, and can very happily forecast the future. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Call now, if there be any that will answer thee</span>; rather, <span class="accented">call now</span>; <span class="accented">is there any that will answer thee?</span> What aid, that is, wilt thou invoke, if thou turnest away from God, and reproachest him? Thinkest thou to find any one in heaven or earth to answer to the call and come to thy assistance? Utterly vain is any such hope. <span class="cmt_word">And to which of the saints wilt thou turn?</span> By "the saints" are meant in this place "the holy angels" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-15.htm">Job 15:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-7.htm">Psalm 89:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a>). The question, "To <span class="accented">which</span> wilt thou turn?" seems to imply that there was already in Job's time some knowledge of individual members of the angelic host, such as Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, etc., though we have no mention of any names of angels in Scripture until the time of Daniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21</a>). That invocation of angels was an actual practice in Job's age is, however, scarcely proved by this passage. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-5 Eliphaz here calls upon Job to answer his arguments. Were any of the saints or servants of God visited with such Divine judgments as Job, or did they ever behave like him under their sufferings? The term, saints, holy, or more strictly, consecrated ones, seems in all ages to have been applied to the people of God, through the Sacrifice slain in the covenant of their reconciliation. Eliphaz doubts not that the sin of sinners directly tends to their ruin. They kill themselves by some lust or other; therefore, no doubt, Job has done some foolish thing, by which he has brought himself into this condition. The allusion was plain to Job's former prosperity; but there was no evidence of Job's wickedness, and the application to him was unfair and severe.</body></html>
