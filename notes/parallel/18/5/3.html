All these general results of experience have the sting of insinuation in them that they contain the key to Job's unfortunate condition.

The "I" is emphatic. "<span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">myself</span> have seen," etc. What Eliphaz had seen was that folly, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> sinful infatuation, was always punished. It might seem to prosper: the foolish man might seem to be taking root; but Eliphaz was not deceived by appearances - he saw through them, he knew that there was a curse upon the man's house, and so pronounced it accursed. And the ruin which he had foreseen, it is implied, followed. But suddenly; rather, <span class="accented">immediately</span>, <span class="accented">without hesitation.</span> I cursed his habitation; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "pronounced it accursed, declared that the curse of God rested upon it?" <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-5 Eliphaz here calls upon Job to answer his arguments. Were any of the saints or servants of God visited with such Divine judgments as Job, or did they ever behave like him under their sufferings? The term, saints, holy, or more strictly, consecrated ones, seems in all ages to have been applied to the people of God, through the Sacrifice slain in the covenant of their reconciliation. Eliphaz doubts not that the sin of sinners directly tends to their ruin. They kill themselves by some lust or other; therefore, no doubt, Job has done some foolish thing, by which he has brought himself into this condition. The allusion was plain to Job's former prosperity; but there was no evidence of Job's wickedness, and the application to him was unfair and severe.</body></html>
