The sins of the fathers arc visited upon the children. Eliphaz makes covert allusion to the death of Job's children (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-19.htm">Job 1:19</a>). Feeling, however, that he is on delicate ground, he goes on into details which in no way fit their case. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (he says) <span class="cmt_word">they are crushed in the gate</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they are oppressed, crushed, by litigations. The house once smitten of God, human beasts of prey enter in; claims are made against the children; lawsuits commenced; all the arts of chicanery set in motion; every effort made to strip them of their last penny. (For the sense here assigned to "the gate," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-7.htm">Job 29:7</a> and Job 31:21.) <span class="cmt_word">Neither is there any to deliver them</span>. No one intercedes on their behalf, undertakes their detente in the courts, or makes any effort to avert their ruin. This picture of legal oppression accords very closely with what we know of the East in all ages (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-23.htm">Isaiah 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-2.htm">Isaiah 10:2</a>, etc.). Oriental cowardice causes men to shrink from casting in their lot with those whom Misfortune has marked as her own. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-5 Eliphaz here calls upon Job to answer his arguments. Were any of the saints or servants of God visited with such Divine judgments as Job, or did they ever behave like him under their sufferings? The term, saints, holy, or more strictly, consecrated ones, seems in all ages to have been applied to the people of God, through the Sacrifice slain in the covenant of their reconciliation. Eliphaz doubts not that the sin of sinners directly tends to their ruin. They kill themselves by some lust or other; therefore, no doubt, Job has done some foolish thing, by which he has brought himself into this condition. The allusion was plain to Job's former prosperity; but there was no evidence of Job's wickedness, and the application to him was unfair and severe.</body></html>
