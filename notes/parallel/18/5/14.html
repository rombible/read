This may be a note of probable date. (Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-10.htm" title="We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men.">Isaiah 59:10</a>, where the thoughts correspond, but the words differ.) This is one of the many passages of Job in which there seems to be an indication of some acquaintance with the events related in the Pentateuch, though the points of contact are too slight for us to be quite sure of it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They meet with darkness in the daytime</span> (comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-10.htm">Isaiah 59:10</a>). The metaphor expresses the bewilderment of the crafty, when they find their schemes foiled, and all their subtlety of no avail. Suddenly their light goes out; they know not what to do, or which way to turn; "their way is hid" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-23.htm">Job 3:23</a>); they are baffled, perplexed, confounded. <span class="cmt_word">And grope in the noonday as in the night</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-25.htm">Job 12:25</a>). A variant form of the preceding hemistich. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:6-16 Eliphaz reminds Job, that no affliction comes by chance, nor is to be placed to second causes. The difference between prosperity and adversity is not so exactly observed, as that between day and night, summer and winter; but it is according to the will and counsel of God. We must not attribute our afflictions to fortune, for they are from God; nor our sins to fate, for they are from ourselves. Man is born in sin, and therefore born to trouble. There is nothing in this world we are born to, and can truly call our own, but sin and trouble. Actual transgressions are sparks that fly out of the furnace of original corruption. Such is the frailty of our bodies, and the vanity of all our enjoyments, that our troubles arise thence as the sparks fly upward; so many are they, and so fast does one follow another. Eliphaz reproves Job for not seeking God, instead of quarrelling with him. Is any afflicted? let him pray. It is heart's ease, a salve for every sore. Eliphaz speaks of rain, which we are apt to look upon as a little thing; but if we consider how it is produced, and what is produced by it, we shall see it to be a great work of power and goodness. Too often the great Author of all our comforts, and the manner in which they are conveyed to us, are not noticed, because they are received as things of course. In the ways of Providence, the experiences of some are encouragements to others, to hope the best in the worst of times; for it is the glory of God to send help to the helpless, and hope to the hopeless. And daring sinners are confounded, and forced to acknowledge the justice of God's proceedings.</body></html>
