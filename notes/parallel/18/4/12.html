It was night, and he had fallen asleep, when suddenly he was, or seemed to himself to be, awake. A horrible fear came over him, and all his limbs trembled and quaked. Then a spirit seemed to pass before his face, while every hair on his body rose up and stiffened with horror. It did not simply pass across him, but stood still, in a formless form, which he could see but not clearly distinguish. There was a deep hush. Then out of the silence there seemed to come a voice, a whisper, which articulated solemn words. "Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man," etc.? Supernatural visitations were vouchsafed by God to many besides the chosen people - to Laban, when he pursued Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-24.htm">Genesis 31:24</a>), to Abimelech (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-6.htm">Genesis 20:6</a>), to the Pharaoh of the time of Joseph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-1.htm">Genesis 41:1-7</a>), to his chief butler (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-9.htm">Genesis 40:9-11</a>), and his chief baker (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-16.htm">Genesis 40:16, 17</a>), to Balaam the son of Beer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-12.htm">Numbers 22:12, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-5.htm">Numbers 23:5-10, 16-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3-9, 15-24</a>), to Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-28.htm">Daniel 2:28-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-1.htm">Daniel 4:1-32</a>), and others. The method and manner of these visitations raise a multitude of questions which it is impossible to answer, but are convincing evidence to all who believe Scripture to be true, that communications can pass between the spiritual and material worlds of a strange and mysterious character. The communication to Eliphaz may have been a mere vision, impressed upon his mind in sleep, or it may have been actually brought to him by a spiritual messenger, whom he could dimly see, and whose voice he was privileged to hear. Modern pseudo-science pronounces such seeing and hearing to be impossible. But poets are often clearer-sighted than scientists, and Shakespeare utters a pregnant truth when he says - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,<br />Than are dreamt of in your philosophy."</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now a thing was secretly brought to me</span>; rather, <span class="accented">a word</span> (or, <span class="accented">a message</span>) <span class="accented">was brought to me stealthily. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And mine ear received a little thereof</span>; rather, a <span class="accented">whisper</span> thereof (see the Revised Version, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-14.htm">Job 26:14</a>, and the Vulgate, which gives <span class="accented">susurrus</span>). As the form of the vision was not distinct to Eliphaz's eyes (ver. 16), so neither were the words which were uttered distinct to his ears. He thinks himself able, however, to give the sense of them (see vers. 17-21). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:12-21 Eliphaz relates a vision. When we are communing with our own hearts, and are still, Ps 4:4, then is a time for the Holy Spirit to commune with us. This vision put him into very great fear. Ever since man sinned, it has been terrible to him to receive communications from Heaven, conscious that he can expect no good tidings thence. Sinful man! shall he pretend to be more just, more pure, than God, who being his Maker, is his Lord and Owner? How dreadful, then, the pride and presumption of man! How great the patience of God! Look upon man in his life. The very foundation of that cottage of clay in which man dwells, is in the dust, and it will sink with its own weight. We stand but upon the dust. Some have a higher heap of dust to stand upon than others but still it is the earth that stays us up, and will shortly swallow us up. Man is soon crushed; or if some lingering distemper, which consumes like a moth, be sent to destroy him, he cannot resist it. Shall such a creature pretend to blame the appointments of God? Look upon man in his death. Life is short, and in a little time men are cut off. Beauty, strength, learning, not only cannot secure them from death, but these things die with them; nor shall their pomp, their wealth, or power, continue after them. Shall a weak, sinful, dying creature, pretend to be more just than God, and more pure than his Maker? No: instead of quarrelling with his afflictions, let him wonder that he is out of hell. Can a man be cleansed without his Maker? Will God justify sinful mortals, and clear them from guilt? or will he do so without their having an interest in the righteousness and gracious help of their promised Redeemer, when angels, once ministering spirits before his throne, receive the just recompence of their sins? Notwithstanding the seeming impunity of men for a short time, though living without God in the world, their doom is as certain as that of the fallen angels, and is continually overtaking them. Yet careless sinners note it so little, that they expect not the change, nor are wise to consider their latter end.</body></html>
