Should not the piety thou wast so ready to commend to others supply a sufficient ground of hope for thyself?"

If he does not, what is the natural inference? Surely, that he is not so confident of his innocence as he professes to be. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-6 Satan undertook to prove Job a hypocrite by afflicting him; and his friends concluded him to be one because he was so afflicted, and showed impatience. This we must keep in mind if we would understand what passed. Eliphaz speaks of Job, and his afflicted condition, with tenderness; but charges him with weakness and faint-heartedness. Men make few allowances for those who have taught others. Even pious friends will count that only a touch which we feel as a wound. Learn from hence to draw off the mind of a sufferer from brooding over the affliction, to look at the God of mercies in the affliction. And how can this be done so well as by looking to Christ Jesus, in whose unequalled sorrows every child of God soonest learns to forget his own?</body></html>
