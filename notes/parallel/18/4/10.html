Wicked men, especially oppressors, are often compared to lions in Scripture (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-2.htm">Psalm 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-9.htm">Psalm 10:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-12.htm">Psalm 17:12</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-3.htm">Ezekiel 19:3, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-12.htm">Nahum 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-3.htm">Zephaniah 3:3</a>, etc.). The meaning of Eliphaz is that, within his experience, all classes of wicked men, young, or old, or middle-aged, weak or strong, have received in this life the reward of their iniquity. However fiercely they might roar, however greedily they might devour, their roaring has died away, their teeth have been broken in their mouths, vengeance has lighted on them in some shape or other; they have paid the penalty of their transgressions. Five classes of lions seem to be spoken of in this and the following verses: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the whelp (ver. 11); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the half-grown lion, just able to make its voice heard; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the young full-grown lion (<span class="accented">cephir</span>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the lion in full maturity (<span class="accented">ariyeh</span>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> the old lion which is growing decrepit (<span class="accented">laish</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To these is joined (ver. 11) <span class="accented">labi</span>, "the lioness." Lions are still frequent in the Mesopotamian region ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. pp 39, 221), though no longer found in Palestine, nor in Arabia. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:7-11 Eliphaz argues, 1. That good men were never thus ruined. But there is one event both to the righteous and to the wicked, Ec 9:2, both in life and death; the great and certain difference is after death. Our worst mistakes are occasioned by drawing wrong views from undeniable truths. 2. That wicked men were often thus ruined: for the proof of this, Eliphaz vouches his own observation. We may see the same every day.</body></html>
