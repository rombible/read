but it seems more probable that the figure is forensic: "Thou still bringest fresh witnesses against me, and multipliest thine anger against me, so that relays of them, even a host, are against me; for they come upon me host after host--these witnesses of Thine anger, the ministers of Thy vengeance." The sublimity of this indictment against God is only equalled by the sense of terrific awe with which one reads it. The language is Job's, and so far has the sanction of Holy Writ; but we may surely learn therefrom the condescension as well as the loving-kindness of the Most High.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou renewest thy witnesses against me</span>. Each fresh calamity that Job suffers is a new witness that God is displeased with him, both in his own eyes, and in those of his "comforters." Hie disease was no doubt continually progressing, and going from bad to worse, so that every day a new calamity seemed to befall him. And increasest thine indignation upon me; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "makest it more and more evidently to appear, that thou art angry with me." Changes and war are against me; rather, <span class="accented">changes and a host</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> attacks that are continually changing - a whole host of them, or "host after host" (Revised Version margin), come against me. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:14-22 Job did not deny that as a sinner he deserved his sufferings; but he thought that justice was executed upon him with peculiar rigour. His gloom, unbelief, and hard thoughts of God, were as much to be ascribed to Satan's inward temptations, and his anguish of soul, under the sense of God's displeasure, as to his outward trials, and remaining depravity. Our Creator, become in Christ our Redeemer also, will not destroy the work of his hands in any humble believer; but will renew him unto holiness, that he may enjoy eternal life. If anguish on earth renders the grave a desirable refuge, what will be their condition who are condemned to the blackness of darkness for ever? Let every sinner seek deliverance from that dreadful state, and every believer be thankful to Jesus, who delivereth from the wrath to come.</body></html>
