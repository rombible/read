Job's idea of the receptacle of the dead, while it has some analogies with the Egyptian under-world, and even more with the Greek and Roman conceptions of Hades or Orcus, was probably derived from Babylonia, or Chaldea, on which the land that he inhabited bordered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-17.htm">Job 1:17</a>). It was within the earth, consequently dark and sunless (compare the <span class="accented">Umbrae</span> of the Romans, and Euripides's <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>), deep (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-8.htm">Job 11:8</a>), dreary, fastened with belts and bars (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-16.htm">Job 17:16</a>). The Babylonians spoke of it as "the abode of darkness and famine, where earth was men's food, and their nourishment clay; where light was not seen, but in darkness they dwelt; where ghosts, like birds, fluttered their wings; and where, on the doors and on the door-posts, the dust lay undisturbed" (Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, vol. 1. p. 118). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:14-22 Job did not deny that as a sinner he deserved his sufferings; but he thought that justice was executed upon him with peculiar rigour. His gloom, unbelief, and hard thoughts of God, were as much to be ascribed to Satan's inward temptations, and his anguish of soul, under the sense of God's displeasure, as to his outward trials, and remaining depravity. Our Creator, become in Christ our Redeemer also, will not destroy the work of his hands in any humble believer; but will renew him unto holiness, that he may enjoy eternal life. If anguish on earth renders the grave a desirable refuge, what will be their condition who are condemned to the blackness of darkness for ever? Let every sinner seek deliverance from that dreadful state, and every believer be thankful to Jesus, who delivereth from the wrath to come.</body></html>
