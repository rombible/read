There is not much that is novel in the long expostulation, which mainly goes over ground covered in ch. 3, 6, and 7; but some new grounds are alleged as pleas for mercy, if not for justice. These are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that he is God's gesture, and in the past (at any rate) has been the object of his care (vers. 8, 8-12); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that God must be above judging as man judges (vers. 4, 5); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that God knows his innocence (ver. 7); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that he (Job) is entirely in God's power (ver. 7). In conclusion, Job begs for a little respite, a little time of comfort (ver. 20), before he descends into the darkness of the grave (vers. 21, 22). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My soul is weary of my life</span>. This is better than the marginal rendering, and well expresses the original. It strikes the key-note of the chapter. I will leave my complaint upon myself; rather, I <span class="accented">will give free course to my complaint over myself</span>, <span class="accented">or</span> I <span class="accented">will allow myself in the expression of it</span> (see the Revised Version). Job implies that hitherto he has put some restraint upon himself, but now he will give full and free expression to his feelings. I will speak in the bitterness of my soul (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-11.htm">Job 7:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-7 Job, being weary of his life, resolves to complain, but he will not charge God with unrighteousness. Here is a prayer that he might be delivered from the sting of his afflictions, which is sin. When God afflicts us, he contends with us; when he contends with us, there is always a reason; and it is desirable to know the reason, that we may repent of and forsake the sin for which God has a controversy with us. But when, like Job, we speak in the bitterness of our souls, we increase guilt and vexation. Let us harbour no hard thoughts of God; we shall hereafter see there was no cause for them. Job is sure that God does not discover things, nor judge of them, as men do; therefore he thinks it strange that God continues him under affliction, as if he must take time to inquire into his sin.</body></html>
