Thou huntest me;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thou art continually pursuing me with thy plagues, thy "arrows" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>), thy" wounds" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-17.htm">Job 9:17</a>), thy poisoned shafts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>). Thou givest me no rest, therefore I am ever conscious of my afflictions. As a fierce lion. Schultens regards Job as the lion, and so Jarchi and others. But most commentators take the view that the lion is God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-13.htm">Isaiah 38:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-38.htm">Jeremiah 25:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-10.htm">Lamentations 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-14.htm">Hosea 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-7.htm">Hosea 13:7, 8</a>).

His gloom, unbelief, and hard thoughts of God, were as much to be ascribed to Satan's inward temptations, and his anguish of soul, under the sense of God's displeasure, as to his outward trials, and remaining depravity. Our Creator, become in Christ our Redeemer also, will not destroy the work of his hands in any humble believer; but will renew him unto holiness, that he may enjoy eternal life. If anguish on earth renders the grave a desirable refuge, what will be their condition who are condemned to the blackness of darkness for ever? Let every sinner seek deliverance from that dreadful state, and every believer be thankful to Jesus, who delivereth from the wrath to come.</body></html>
