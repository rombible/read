He has no conception that his sufferings are a purification (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-2.htm">John 15:2</a>), intended to lead to the elevation and improvement of his moral character. He therefore asks - Is it worthy of God, is it good in him, is it compatible with his perfect excellence, to be an oppressor? It is a sort of <span class="accented">argumentum ad verecundiam</span> well enough between man and man, but quite out of place between a man and his Maker. <span class="cmt_word">That thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/138-8.htm">Psalm 138:8</a>). This argument is more legitimate. God may be expected, not to despise, but to care for, the work of his own hands (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-25.htm">Isaiah 19:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-23.htm">Isaiah 29:23</a>; 64:21; Isaiah 64:8; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>). Every maker of a thing, as Aristotle says, loves his work, and naturally guards it, cares for it, and cherishes it<span class="cmt_word">. And shine upon the counsel of the wicked</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-24.htm">Job 9:24</a>). The prosperity of evil-doers must arise, Job thinks, from God allowing his countenance to shine upon them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-7 Job, being weary of his life, resolves to complain, but he will not charge God with unrighteousness. Here is a prayer that he might be delivered from the sting of his afflictions, which is sin. When God afflicts us, he contends with us; when he contends with us, there is always a reason; and it is desirable to know the reason, that we may repent of and forsake the sin for which God has a controversy with us. But when, like Job, we speak in the bitterness of our souls, we increase guilt and vexation. Let us harbour no hard thoughts of God; we shall hereafter see there was no cause for them. Job is sure that God does not discover things, nor judge of them, as men do; therefore he thinks it strange that God continues him under affliction, as if he must take time to inquire into his sin.</body></html>
