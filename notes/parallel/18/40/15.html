The word in Hebrew is really the natural plural of beh?m?h, which means <span class= "ital">domestic cattle; </span>and this fact would suggest the idea that more than one animal may be meant in the description (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/40-15.htm" title="Behold now behemoth, which I made with you; he eats grass as an ox.">Job 40:15-24</a>), which scarcely seems to answer to one and the same. In this way the <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/40-15.htm" title="Behold now behemoth, which I made with you; he eats grass as an ox.">Job 40:15-20</a> would describe very well the elephant, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/40-21.htm" title="He lies under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.">Job 40:21-24</a> the hippopotamus. The objection to this is, that beh?m?h is commonly used of domestic cattle in contrast to wild beasts, whereas neither the elephant nor the hippopotamus can come under the category of domestic animals. There is a word in Coptic (p-ehe-emmou, meaning water-ox), used for the hippopotamus, which may, perhaps, lie concealed in behemoth. Then the difficulty is to make the description answer throughout to the hippopotamus (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-20.htm" title="Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.">Job 40:20</a>), since the hippopotamus does not frequent mountains, neither does it exactly eat grass like an ox (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-15.htm" title="Behold now behemoth, which I made with you; he eats grass as an ox.">Job 40:15</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Which I made with thee.</span>--Fellow-creatures of thine, to inhabit the world with thee: thus skilfully reminding him that he had a common origin with the beasts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-24.</span> - This passage, together with the whole of ch. 41, has been regarded by some critics as an interpolation. Its omission would certainly not affect the argument; and it is thought, in some respects, to contain traces of a later age than that which most commentators assign to the remainder of the book, or, at any rate, to the greater portion of it. The recurrence to the animal creation, when the subject seemed to have been completed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-30.htm">Job 39:30</a>), is also a difficulty. But, on the other hand, as there is no variation, either in the manuscripts or in the versions, and no marked difference either of style or tone of thought between the rest of the book and this controverted passage, it is best regarded as an integral portion of the work, proceeding from the same author, although perhaps at a later period. No one denies that the style is that of the best Hebrew poetry, or that the book would be weakened by the excision of the passage. "Le style," says M. Renan, "est celui des meilleurs endroits du poeme. Nulle part la coupe n'est pins vigoreuse, le parallelisme plus sonore.' <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold now behemoth</span>. "Behemoth" is ordinarily the plural of <span class="accented">behemah</span> "a beast;" but it is scarcely possible to understand the word in this sense in the present passage, where it seems to be a noun singular, being followed by singular verbs, and represented by singular pronouns. Hence modern critics almost unanimously regard the word here as designating "some particular animal." The mammoth, the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, and the elephant have been suggested. Of these the mammoth is precluded by the want of any evidence that it existed in Job's day, and the rhinoceros by the absence of any allusion to its peculiar feature. Authorities are divided almost equally between the elephant and the hippopotamus; but the best recent Hebraists and naturalists incline rather to the latter. <span class="cmt_word">Which I made with thee</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "which I created at the same time as I created thee" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-24.htm">Genesis 1:24-26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He eateth grass as an ox</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he is graminivorous, not carnivorous. This is admitted to be true of the hippopotamus, which lives in the Nile during the day, and at night emerges from the river, and devastates the crops of sugar-cane, rice, and millet. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:15-24 God, for the further proving of his own power, describes two vast animals, far exceeding man in bulk and strength. Behemoth signifies beasts. Most understand it of an animal well known in Egypt, called the river-horse, or hippopotamus. This vast animal is noticed as an argument to humble ourselves before the great God; for he created this vast animal, which is so fearfully and wonderfully made. Whatever strength this or any other creature has, it is derived from God. He that made the soul of man, knows all the ways to it, and can make the sword of justice, his wrath, to approach and touch it. Every godly man has spiritual weapons, the whole armour of God, to resist, yea, to overcome the tempter, that his never-dying soul may be safe, whatever becomes of his frail flesh and mortal body.</body></html>
