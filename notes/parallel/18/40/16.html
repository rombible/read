The strength of the hippopotamus is its principal characteristic. Weighing often two thousand kilogrammes, and of a short thick make, when roused to anger it has a force which is irresistible. In the water it upsets large beats; on land it forces its way through dense thickets and fences of all kinds. The loins are especially strong, being deep, broad, and immensely muscular<span class="cmt_word">. And his force is in the navel of his belly</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the muscles of his bell'i.</span> The word used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) occurs only in this place. It is a plural form, and therefore cannot designate a single object, like the navel. The root seems to be the Syriac <span class="accented">serir</span> "firm," whence Schultens proposes to translate <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> by <span class="accented">firmitates.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:15-24 God, for the further proving of his own power, describes two vast animals, far exceeding man in bulk and strength. Behemoth signifies beasts. Most understand it of an animal well known in Egypt, called the river-horse, or hippopotamus. This vast animal is noticed as an argument to humble ourselves before the great God; for he created this vast animal, which is so fearfully and wonderfully made. Whatever strength this or any other creature has, it is derived from God. He that made the soul of man, knows all the ways to it, and can make the sword of justice, his wrath, to approach and touch it. Every godly man has spiritual weapons, the whole armour of God, to resist, yea, to overcome the tempter, that his never-dying soul may be safe, whatever becomes of his frail flesh and mortal body.</body></html>
