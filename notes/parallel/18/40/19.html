The last clause is very obscure. Some render, "He only that made him can bring his sword near unto him;" or, "He that made him hath furnished him with his sword." Others, "He that would dress him (as meat) let him come near him with his sword !" indicating the inequality of the contest. Perhaps a combination of the first and last is best--"Let his Maker (but no one else venture to) approach him with His sword."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He is the chief of the ways of God</span>. This is the main argument in favour of the elephant, rather than the hippopotamus, being intended (see Schultens, <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). It has, indeed, been argued that some specimens of the hippopotamus exceed the elephant in height and bulk (Canon Cook, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 19); but no modern naturalist certainly would place the former animal above the latter in any <span class="accented">catalogue raisonee</span> of animals arranged according to their size and importance. The elephant, however, may not have been known to the author of Job, or, at any rate, the Asiatic species, which seems not to have been imported into Assyria before the middle of the <span class="date">ninth century B.C.</span> In this case, the hippopotamus might well seem to him the grandest of the works of God. <span class="cmt_word">He that made him can make his sword to approach unto him</span>. This is explained to mean, "Only God can attack behemoth with success and slay him; man is powerless to do so" (Canon Cook, Stanley Leathes, Revised Version). But the Egyptians, from very early times, used to attack the hippopotamus and slay him (Wilkinson, in the author's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2, p. 100). It is better, therefore, to translate the passage, with Schultens, "He that made him hath furnished him with his sword," and to understand by "his sword" those sharp teeth with which the hippopotamus is said to "cut the grass as <span class="accented">neatly as if it were mown</span> and to sever, as <span class="accented">if</span> <span class="accented">with shears</span> a tolerably stout and thick stem" (Wood, ' Natural History,' vol. 1. p. 762).

Behemoth signifies beasts. Most understand it of an animal well known in Egypt, called the river-horse, or hippopotamus. This vast animal is noticed as an argument to humble ourselves before the great God; for he created this vast animal, which is so fearfully and wonderfully made. Whatever strength this or any other creature has, it is derived from God. He that made the soul of man, knows all the ways to it, and can make the sword of justice, his wrath, to approach and touch it. Every godly man has spiritual weapons, the whole armour of God, to resist, yea, to overcome the tempter, that his never-dying soul may be safe, whatever becomes of his frail flesh and mortal body.</body></html>
