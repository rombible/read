He brought Israel out of Egypt ,' with a mighty hand and stretched-out arm" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-15.htm">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-19.htm">Deuteronomy 7:19</a>, etc.). "Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand," says one of the psalmists (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-13.htm">Psalm 89:13</a>). "Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord!" says Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>).

And those who are truly convinced of sin, yet need to be more thoroughly convinced and more humbled. No doubt God, and he only, has power to humble and bring down proud men; he has wisdom to know when and how to do it, and it is not for us to teach him how to govern the world. Our own hands cannot save us by recommending us to God's grace, much less rescuing us from his justice; and therefore into his hand we must commit ourselves. The renewal of a believer proceeds in the same way of conviction, humbling, and watchfulness against remaining sin, as his first conversion. When convinced of many evils in our conduct, we still need convincing of many more.</body></html>
