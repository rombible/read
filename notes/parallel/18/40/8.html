God is about to show Job his inability to govern the world and administer judgment among men, so as to rule them morally, from his acknowledged inability to govern the more formidable animals of the brute creation. If he cannot restrain them, how is it likely that he will be able to tread down the wicked in their place? And if he cannot hold the wicked in check and compel them to submission, how, any more, can he protect himself from their violence? how can he save himself from the outbursts of their fury? or, if not save himself from them, how much less can he deliver himself from the hand of God? If he cannot hide them in the dust together, and bind them (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>restrain the threatenings of their rage in the hidden world) in the secret prison-house, how much less can he save himself, and be independent of the help of a saviour?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wilt thou also</span> (rather, <span class="accented">even</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>dis<span class="accented">-</span>annul my judgment?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> maintain that my judgment towards thee has not been just and equitable, and therefore, so far as it lies in thy power, disannul it? <span class="cmt_word">Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?</span> Dost thou think it necessary to accuse me of injustice, and condemn me. in order to establish thine own innocence?

And those who are truly convinced of sin, yet need to be more thoroughly convinced and more humbled. No doubt God, and he only, has power to humble and bring down proud men; he has wisdom to know when and how to do it, and it is not for us to teach him how to govern the world. Our own hands cannot save us by recommending us to God's grace, much less rescuing us from his justice; and therefore into his hand we must commit ourselves. The renewal of a believer proceeds in the same way of conviction, humbling, and watchfulness against remaining sin, as his first conversion. When convinced of many evils in our conduct, we still need convincing of many more.</body></html>
