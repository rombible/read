Job here begins his review of all creation, to show that God has the absolute direction of it. The order of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> beasts, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> birds, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> fishes, is that of dignity (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-2.htm">Genesis 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-7.htm">Psalm 8:7, 8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Job maintains that, if appeal were made to the animal creation, and they were asked their position with respect to God, they would with one voice proclaim him their absolute Ruler and Director. <span class="cmt_word">And the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee</span>. The instincts of birds, their periodical migrations, their inherited habits, are as wonderful as anything in the Divine economy of the universe, and as much imply God's continually directing hand. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:6-11 Job appeals to facts. The most audacious robbers, oppressors, and impious wretches, often prosper. Yet this is not by fortune or chance; the Lord orders these things. Worldly prosperity is of small value in his sight: he has better things for his children. Job resolves all into the absolute proprietorship which God has in all the creatures. He demands from his friends liberty to judge of what they had said; he appeals to any fair judgment.</body></html>
