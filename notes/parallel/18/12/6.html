Having set at rest the personal question between himself and his friends, Job reverts to his main argument, and maintains that, the whole course of mundane events being under God's governance, all the results are to be attributed to him, and among them both the prosperity of the wicked, and, by parity of reasoning, the sufferings of the righteous. <span class="cmt_word">And they that provoke God are secure</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-24.htm">Job 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-3.htm">Job 10:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Into whose hand God bringeth abundantly</span>.

The most audacious robbers, oppressors, and impious wretches, often prosper. Yet this is not by fortune or chance; the Lord orders these things. Worldly prosperity is of small value in his sight: he has better things for his children. Job resolves all into the absolute proprietorship which God has in all the creatures. He demands from his friends liberty to judge of what they had said; he appeals to any fair judgment.</body></html>
