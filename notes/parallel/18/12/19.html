The latter part of this chapter seems to re-echo the sentiments of Eliphaz in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/5-11.htm" title="To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.">Job 5:11-16</a>; but, instead of giving them the optimist direction he had sketched, he confesses that his own position is rather one of blank despair. Eliphaz is quite sure he possesses the key to the interpretation of the ways of Providence. Job ever fears that his ignorance is so profound as to amount almost to sheer hopelessness, Job is thus the type of a man who has felt the hollowness and unreality of traditional orthodox), and is feeling his way in thick darkness, sustained, nevertheless, by an unquenchable faith that there is light, and that the light will eventually dawn. That this character is the more acceptable to the God of truth is made abundantly clear in the sequel. It is to be observed, however, that Job's breadth of view far exceeds that of Eliphaz, inasmuch as the latter generalises vaguely, while Job declares that not men, but <span class= "ital">nations, </span>are the subjects of God's guiding providence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He leadeth princes away spoiled</span>; rather, priests (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d4;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), as in the Revised Version. This is the only mention of "priests" in the Book of Job, and a priest-caste, such as that of Egypt or of Israel, can scarcely be meant. The priests are placed among the mighty, on a par with kings (ver. 18), princes (ver. 21), and "the strong" (ver. 21). This context makes us naturally think of those priest-kings whom we hear of in the olden times, such as were Melchizedek (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-18.htm">Genesis 19:18-20</a>) and Jethro (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-1.htm">Exodus 18:1-27</a>), and the Egyptian kings of the twenty-first dynasty ('History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 2. pp. 408-415), and Ethbaal of Tyro ('History of Phoenicia,' p. 435), and Sethos (Herod., 2, 141), and others. Job's allusion is probably to persons of this exalted class, who no doubt were sometimes defeated and dragged into captivity, like other rulers and governors. And overthroweth the mighty. Schultens understands by <span class="accented">ethanim</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) "great teachers;" but the ordinary meaning of the word is "strong" or "mighty" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-19.htm">Job 33:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:12-25 This is a noble discourse of Job concerning the wisdom, power, and sovereignty of God, in ordering all the affairs of the children of men, according to the counsel of His own will, which none can resist. It were well if wise and good men, who differ about lesser things, would see how it is for their honour and comfort, and the good of others, to dwell most upon the great things in which they agree. Here are no complaints, or reflections. He gives many instances of God's powerful management of the children of men, overruling all their counsels, and overcoming all their oppositions. Having all strength and wisdom, God knows how to make use, even of those who are foolish and bad; otherwise there is so little wisdom and so little honesty in the world, that all had been in confusion and ruin long ago. These important truths were suited to convince the disputants that they were out of their depth in attempting to assign the Lord's reasons for afflicting Job; his ways are unsearchable, and his judgments past finding out. Let us remark what beautiful illustrations there are in the word of God, confirming his sovereignty, and wisdom in that sovereignty: but the highest and infinitely the most important is, that the Lord Jesus was crucified by the malice of the Jews; and who but the Lord could have known that this one event was the salvation of the world?</body></html>
