Sheba, as understood here, was probably a district on the Arabian Gulf (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-15.htm" title="And the Sabeans fell on them, and took them away; yes, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.">Job 1:15</a>), where merchants trafficked with the distant cities of the East, as well as enriched themselves with the plunder of their neighbours, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-15.htm" title="And the Sabeans fell on them, and took them away; yes, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.">Job 1:15</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The troops of Tema looked</span>. The Tema were an Arab tribe descended from Ishmael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-15.htm">Genesis 25:15</a>). They are generally conjoined with Dedan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-13.htm">Isaiah 21:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a>), another Arab tribe, noted for carry-lug on a caravan trade. Both tribes probably wandered, and occupied at different periods different portions of the desert. The name, Tema, may linger in the modern city and district of <span class="accented">Tayma</span> on the confines of Syria, and upon the pilgrim-route between Damascus and Mecca. The "troops of Tema" probably looked for the "caravans" of ver. 18 to arrive in their country; but they looked in vain. The desert had swallowed them up. <span class="cmt_word">The companies of Sheba waited for them</span>. (On "Sheba," see the comment upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-15.htm">Job 1:15</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:14-30 In his prosperity Job formed great expectations from his friends, but now was disappointed. This he compares to the failing of brooks in summer. Those who rest their expectations on the creature, will find it fail when it should help them; whereas those who make God their confidence, have help in the time of need, Heb 4:16. Those who make gold their hope, sooner or later will be ashamed of it, and of their confidence in it. It is our wisdom to cease from man. Let us put all our confidence in the Rock of ages, not in broken reeds; in the Fountain of life, not in broken cisterns. The application is very close; for now ye are nothing. It were well for us, if we had always such convictions of the vanity of the creature, as we have had, or shall have, on a sick-bed, a death-bed, or in trouble of conscience. Job upbraids his friends with their hard usage. Though in want, he desired no more from them than a good look and a good word. It often happens that, even when we expect little from man, we have less; but from God, even when we expect much, we have more. Though Job differed from them, yet he was ready to yield as soon as it was made to appear that he was in error. Though Job had been in fault, yet they ought not to have given him such hard usage. His righteousness he holds fast, and will not let it go. He felt that there had not been such iniquity in him as they supposed. But it is best to commit our characters to Him who keeps our souls; in the great day every upright believer shall have praise of God.</body></html>
