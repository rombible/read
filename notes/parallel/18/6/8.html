However exceptional Job's trials, yet his language is the common language of all sufferers who think that relief, if it comes, must come through change of circumstances rather than in themselves in relation to circumstances. Thus Job looks forward to death as his only hope; whereas with God and in God there were many years of life and prosperity in store for him. So strong is this feeling in him, that he calls death the thing that he longs for, his hope or expectation. (Comp. Job 17, where even the hope that he had in death seems to have passed away and to have issued in blank hopelessness.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Oh that I might have my request!</span> Here the second point is taken up. Eliphaz has threatened Job with death, representing it as the last and most terrible of punishments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-9.htm">Job 4:9, 20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-2.htm">Job 5:2</a>). Job's reply is that there is nothing he desires so much as death. His primary wish would have been never to have been born (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-3.htm">Job 3:3-10</a>); next to that, he would have desired an early death - the earlier the more acceptable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-11.htm">Job 3:11-19</a>). As both these have been denied him, what he now desires, and earnestly asks for, is a speedy demise. It is not as yet clear what he thinks death to be, or whether he has any hope beyond the grave. Putting aside all such considerations, he here simply balances death against such a life as he now leads, and must expect to lead, since his disease is incurable, and decides in favour of death. It is not only his desire, but his "request" to God, that death may come to him quickly. <span class="cmt_word">And that God would grant me the thing that I long for</span>; literally, <span class="accented">my expectation</span> or <span class="accented">wish</span>. The idea of taking his own life does not seem to have occurred to Job, as it would to a Greek (Plato, 'Phaedo,' &sect; 16) or a Roman (Pithy, 'Epist.,' 1:12). He is too genuine a child of nature, too simple and unsophisticated, for such a thought to occur, and, if it occurred, would be too religious to entertain it for a moment. Like Aristotle, he would feel the act to be cowardly (Aristotle, 'Eth. Nic.,' 5, <span class="accented">sub fin.</span>); and, like Plato (<span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.), he would view it as rebellion against the will of God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:8-13 Job had desired death as the happy end of his miseries. For this, Eliphaz had reproved him, but he asks for it again with more vehemence than before. It was very rash to speak thus of God destroying him. Who, for one hour, could endure the wrath of the Almighty, if he let loose his hand against him? Let us rather say with David, O spare me a little. Job grounds his comfort upon the testimony of his conscience, that he had been, in some degree, serviceable to the glory of God. Those who have grace in them, who have the evidence of it, and have it in exercise, have wisdom in them, which will be their help in the worst of times.</body></html>
