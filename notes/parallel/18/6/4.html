So Shakespeare speaks of "the slings and <span class="accented">arrows</span> el outrageous fortune" for calamities generally. The metaphor is a very common one (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-23.htm">Deuteronomy 32:23, 42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-12.htm">Psalm 21:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-13.htm">Lamentations 3:13, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The poison whereof</span>. Poisoned arrows, such as are now employed by the savage tribes of Central Africa, were common in antiquity, though seldom used by civilized nations. Ovid declares that the Scythians of his time made use of them ('Tristia,' 1, 2). <span class="cmt_word">Drinketh up my spirit</span>; rather, <span class="accented">my spirit drinketh up.</span> Job's spirit absorbs the poison that festers in his wounds, and therefore loses control over itself. This is his apology for his vehemence; he is well-nigh distraught. He adds<span class="cmt_word">, The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me</span>. Besides actual pains and sufferings, he is assailed by fears. God's terrors, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all the other evils that he has at his disposal, are drawn up against him, as it were, in battle array, and still further agitate and distract his soul. What further troubles may not God bring upon him? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-7 Job still justifies himself in his complaints. In addition to outward troubles, the inward sense of God's wrath took away all his courage and resolution. The feeling sense of the wrath of God is harder to bear than any outward afflictions. What then did the Saviour endure in the garden and on the cross, when he bare our sins, and his soul was made a sacrifice to Divine justice for us! Whatever burden of affliction, in body or estate, God is pleased to lay upon us, we may well submit to it as long as he continues to us the use of our reason, and the peace of our conscience; but if either of these is disturbed, our case is very pitiable. Job reflects upon his friends for their censures. He complains he had nothing offered for his relief, but what was in itself tasteless, loathsome, and burdensome.</body></html>
