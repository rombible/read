The speaker may mean that, notwithstanding all that might befall him, his consolation would still be that he had never denied the words of the Holy One. The words "I would harden myself in sorrow" are the most doubtful, not occurring elsewhere in Scripture. Some render the two clauses, "I would exult, or rejoice, in pain that spareth not;" but "Let him not spare," or "Though he spare not," seems preferable.

For this, Eliphaz had reproved him, but he asks for it again with more vehemence than before. It was very rash to speak thus of God destroying him. Who, for one hour, could endure the wrath of the Almighty, if he let loose his hand against him? Let us rather say with David, O spare me a little. Job grounds his comfort upon the testimony of his conscience, that he had been, in some degree, serviceable to the glory of God. Those who have grace in them, who have the evidence of it, and have it in exercise, have wisdom in them, which will be their help in the worst of times.</body></html>
