The sense may be, "Is it not that I have no help in me, and wisdom is driven quite from me?" or yet again, "Is it because there is no help in me that therefore wisdom is driven far from me?" as is the case by your reproaches and insinuations. (See especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-2.htm" title="For wrath kills the foolish man, and envy slays the silly one.">Job 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-27.htm" title="See this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know you it for your good.">Job 5:27</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is not my help in me?</span> rather, <span class="accented">Is it not that I have no help in me?</span> (Revised Version). Job feels that, instead of having exceptional strength of constitution to enable him to bear up against his exhausting malady, he is absolutely without strength. All his vital power is used up. There is no help in him. <span class="cmt_word">And is wisdom driven quite from me?</span> rather, I<span class="accented">s not soundness driven quite from me? Tushiyah</span> seems to mean here "strength of constitution" - that internal soundness which resists the inroads of disease, and sometimes triumphs over the most serious maladies. Whatever reserve of this kind he may have possessed by nature, it is now, Job feels, altogether lost and gone from him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:8-13 Job had desired death as the happy end of his miseries. For this, Eliphaz had reproved him, but he asks for it again with more vehemence than before. It was very rash to speak thus of God destroying him. Who, for one hour, could endure the wrath of the Almighty, if he let loose his hand against him? Let us rather say with David, O spare me a little. Job grounds his comfort upon the testimony of his conscience, that he had been, in some degree, serviceable to the glory of God. Those who have grace in them, who have the evidence of it, and have it in exercise, have wisdom in them, which will be their help in the worst of times.</body></html>
