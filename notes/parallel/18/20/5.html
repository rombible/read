This is one of the main points of dispute between Job and his opponents. It has been previously maintained by Eliphaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-3.htm">Job 5:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-21.htm">Job 15:21, 29</a>) and by Bildad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-11.htm">Job 8:11-19</a>), as it is now by Zophar, and may be regarded as the traditional belief of the time, which scarcely any ventured to question. His own observation, however, has convinced Job that the fact is otherwise. He has seen the wicked "live, become old, and remain mighty in power" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7</a>); he has seen them "spend their days in wealth," and die quietly, as "in a moment" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-13.htm">Job 21:13</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-2.htm">Job 24:2-24</a> he seems to argue that this is the general, if not universal, lot of such persons. Later on, however, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-13.htm">Job 27:13-23</a>, he retracts this view, or, at any rate, greatly modifies it, admitting that usually retribution does even in this life overtake the wicked. And this seems to be the general sentiment of mankind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Raro antecedentem scelestum,<br />Deseruit pede poena claudlo."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Horace, 'Od.,' 3:2, ll. 31, 32.</span>) There remains, however, the question whether the triumphing of the wicked can fairly be considered "short," and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment. When we consider the lives of Dionysius the elder, Sylla, Marius, Tiberius, Louis XIV., Napoleon, it is difficult to answer this question in the affirmative. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-9 Zophar's discourse is upon the certain misery of the wicked. The triumph of the wicked and the joy of the hypocrite are fleeting. The pleasures and gains of sin bring disease and pain; they end in remorse, anguish, and ruin. Dissembled piety is double iniquity, and the ruin that attends it will be accordingly.</body></html>
