From its effect on cattle, Elihu passes to its effect on man (vers. 1-5); and thence goes on to speak of other natural manifestations of God's power and marvellousness - snow, violent rain, whirlwind, frost, and the like (vers. 6-13). He then makes a final appeal to Job to acknowledge his own weakness and God's perfection and unsearchableness, and to bow down in wonder and adoration before him (vers. 14-24). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At this also</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at the thunderstorm or at the particular crash mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-33.htm">Job 36:33</a>. <span class="cmt_word">My heart trembleth</span>. A violent peal of thunder produces in almost all men a certain amount of nervous trepidation. Elihu seems to have been abnormally sensitive. His heart trembled so that it seemed to be moved out of his place. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/37.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>37:1-13 The changes of the weather are the subject of a great deal of our thoughts and common talk; but how seldom do we think and speak of these things, as Elihu, with a regard to God, the director of them! We must notice the glory of God, not only in the thunder and lightning, but in the more common and less awful changes of the weather; as the snow and rain. Nature directs all creatures to shelter themselves from a storm; and shall man only be unprovided with a refuge? Oh that men would listen to the voice of God, who in many ways warns them to flee from the wrath to come; and invites them to accept his salvation, and to be happy. The ill opinion which men entertain of the Divine direction, peculiarly appears in their murmurs about the weather, though the whole result of the year proves the folly of their complaints. Believers should avoid this; no days are bad as God makes them, though we make many bad by our sins.</body></html>
