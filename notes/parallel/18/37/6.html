The phenomenon of snow is always full of marvel to an Oriental. It comes before him so seldom; it is in itself so strange; it involves things so inexplicable as the sudden solidification of a liquid, crystallization, a marked expansion of bulk, and the sudden assumption by what was colourless of a definite and dazzling colour. In Arabia and the countries bordering on Palestine snow very seldom falls; but in Palestine itself the mountain ranges of Lebanon and Hermon are never without it; and in the region occupied by Job and his friends then is reason to believe that ice and snow were not altogether infrequent (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-16.htm">Job 6:16</a>, and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Likewise to the small rain</span>; or, <span class="accented">to the light shower of rain -</span> "the spring rain," as the Chaldee paraphrast explains it. And to the great rain of his strength; or, "the heavy winter rain," according to the same authority. "The former and the latter rain" - the rain of winter, and the rain of spring - are often mentioned by the sacred writers (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-3.htm">Hosea 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-1.htm">Zechariah 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-7.htm">James 5:7</a>). God gave both, ordinarily, in due course. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/37.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>37:1-13 The changes of the weather are the subject of a great deal of our thoughts and common talk; but how seldom do we think and speak of these things, as Elihu, with a regard to God, the director of them! We must notice the glory of God, not only in the thunder and lightning, but in the more common and less awful changes of the weather; as the snow and rain. Nature directs all creatures to shelter themselves from a storm; and shall man only be unprovided with a refuge? Oh that men would listen to the voice of God, who in many ways warns them to flee from the wrath to come; and invites them to accept his salvation, and to be happy. The ill opinion which men entertain of the Divine direction, peculiarly appears in their murmurs about the weather, though the whole result of the year proves the folly of their complaints. Believers should avoid this; no days are bad as God makes them, though we make many bad by our sins.</body></html>
