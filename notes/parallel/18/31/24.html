This is a sin with which the patriarch had not been directly charged. But it had been more or less insinuated (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-28.htm">Job 15:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-10.htm">Job 20:10, 15, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-24.htm">Job 22:24</a>, etc.). He may also, perhaps, have felt some inclination to it. Or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence. (On the wicked man's trust in riches, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-6.htm">Psalm 49:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-7.htm">Psalm 52:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-10.htm">Psalm 62:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-24.htm">Mark 10:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-19</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:24-32 Job protests, 1. That he never set his heart upon the wealth of this world. How few prosperous professors can appeal to the Lord, that they have not rejoiced because their gains were great! Through the determination to be rich, numbers ruin their souls, or pierce themselves with many sorrows. 2. He never was guilty of idolatry. The source of idolatry is in the heart, and it corrupts men, and provokes God to send judgments upon a nation. 3. He neither desired nor delighted in the hurt of the worst enemy he had. If others bear malice to us, that will not justify us in bearing malice to them. 4. He had never been unkind to strangers. Hospitality is a Christian duty, 1Pe 4:9.</body></html>
