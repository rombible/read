As Eliphaz had maintained (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-6.htm">Job 22:6, 7</a>), and as Job had already denied (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-12.htm">Job 29:12, 16</a>). The duty of relieving the poor, solemnly enjoined upon the people of Israel in the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>), was generally admitted by the civilized nations of antiquity. In Egypt it was especially insisted on. "The Egyptian's duties to mankind," says Dr. Birch, "were comprised in giving bread to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, clothes to the naked, oil to the wounded, and burial to the dead" ('Egypt from the Earliest Times,' p. 46). <span class="cmt_word">Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail</span>. "Thou hast sent widows away empty," was one of the accusations of Eliphaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-9.htm">Job 22:9</a>). "I caused the widow's heart," replied Job, "to sing for joy" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-13.htm">Job 29:13</a>). The widow's weakness has always been felt to give her a special claim on man's benevolence (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-25.htm">Proverbs 15:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-6.htm">Jeremiah 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-16.htm">1 Timothy 5:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:16-23 Job's conscience gave testimony concerning his just and charitable behaviour toward the poor. He is most large upon this head, because in this matter he was particularly accused. He was tender of all, and hurtful to none. Notice the principles by which Job was restrained from being uncharitable and unmerciful. He stood in awe of the Lord, as certainly against him, if he should wrong the poor. Regard to worldly interests may restrain a man from actual crimes; but the grace of God alone can make him hate, dread, and shun sinful thoughts and desires.</body></html>
