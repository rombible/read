His object, therefore, is to show his friends that he has really been more upright than their standard demanded or than they supposed him to be, till his affliction made them suspect him; and this uprightness was the consequence of rigid and inflexible adherence to principle, for he made a covenant with his eyes, as the avenues of sinful desires. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-28.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever looks on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.">Matthew 5:28</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I made a covenant with mine eyes</span>; rather, for <span class="accented">mine eyes.</span> The covenant must have been <span class="accented">with</span> himself. Job means that be came to a fixed resolution, by which he thenceforth guided his conduct, not even to "look upon a woman to lust after her" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>). We must suppose this resolution come to in his early youth, when the passions are strongest, and when so many men go astray. <span class="cmt_word">How then should I look upon a maid!</span> Having made such a resolution, how could I possibly break it by "looking upon a maid"? Job assumes that he could not be so weak as to break a solemn resolution. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:1-8 Job did not speak the things here recorded by way of boasting, but in answer to the charge of hypocrisy. He understood the spiritual nature of God's commandments, as reaching to the thoughts and intents of the heart. It is best to let our actions speak for us; but in some cases we owe it to ourselves and to the cause of God, solemnly to protest our innocence of the crimes of which we are falsely accused. The lusts of the flesh, and the love of the world, are two fatal rocks on which multitudes split; against these Job protests he was always careful to stand upon his guard. And God takes more exact notice of us than we do of ourselves; let us therefore walk circumspectly. He carefully avoided all sinful means of getting wealth. He dreaded all forbidden profit as much as all forbidden pleasure. What we have in the world may be used with comfort, or lost with comfort, if honestly gotten. Without strict honestly and faithfulness in all our dealings, we can have no good evidence of true godliness. Yet how many professors are unable to abide this touchstone!</body></html>
