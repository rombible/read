He now meets this accusation, and affirms that he had regarded his own servants even as brethren, because partakers of a common humanity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant.</span> Job now disclaims a fourth sin - the oppression of his dependants. Eliphaz had taxed him generally with harshness and cruelty in his relations towards those weaker than himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-5.htm">Job 22:5-9</a>), but had not specially pointed to this kind of oppressiveness. As, however, this was the commonest form of the vice, Job deems it right to disclaim it, before addressing himself to the several charges brought by Eliphaz. He has <span class="accented">not</span> ill used his slaves, either male or female. He has not "despised their cause," but given it full consideration and attention; he has heard them when they contended with him; he has allowed them to "contend;" he has been a just, and not a hard master. The slavery of which he speaks is evidently of a kind under which the slave had certain rights, as was the case also under the Mosaic Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2-11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:9-15 All the defilements of the life come from a deceived heart. Lust is a fire in the soul: those that indulge it, are said to burn. It consumes all that is good there, and lays the conscience waste. It kindles the fire of God's wrath, which, if not quenched by the blood of Christ, will consume even to eternal destruction. It consumes the body; it consumes the substance. Burning lusts bring burning judgments. Job had a numerous household, and he managed it well. He considered that he had a Master in heaven; and as we are undone if God should be severe with us, we ought to be mild and gentle towards all with whom we have to do.</body></html>
