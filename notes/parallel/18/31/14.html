If he had been harsh and cruel to his dependants, he would have provoked God's anger, and God would assuredly "rise up" one day to punish. What, then, could he (Job) do? What but submit in silence? <span class="cmt_word">When he visiteth, what shall I answer him?</span> There could be no valid defence. The slave was still a man, a brother - God's creature, equally with his master. <span class="cmt_word">Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?</span> God "hath made of one Mood all nations of men," and all individual me, "to dwell on the face of the earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>). All have rights - in a certain sense, equal rights. All are entitled to just treatment, to kind treatment, to merciful treatment. Job is before his age in recognizing the substantial equality of the slave with the freeman, which otherwise was scarcely taught by any until the promulgation of the gospel (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-2.htm">1 Timothy 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-16.htm">Philemon 1:16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:9-15 All the defilements of the life come from a deceived heart. Lust is a fire in the soul: those that indulge it, are said to burn. It consumes all that is good there, and lays the conscience waste. It kindles the fire of God's wrath, which, if not quenched by the blood of Christ, will consume even to eternal destruction. It consumes the body; it consumes the substance. Burning lusts bring burning judgments. Job had a numerous household, and he managed it well. He considered that he had a Master in heaven; and as we are undone if God should be severe with us, we ought to be mild and gentle towards all with whom we have to do.</body></html>
