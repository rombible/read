(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-24.htm" title="Then the LORD rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;">Genesis 19:24</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/1-10.htm" title="And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.">2Kings 1:10-14</a>.) It is characteristic of the Old Testament poetry to see in the convulsions of nature the immediate action of the Most High; but perhaps it is intended throughout Job that we should see more than this, as the book undoubtedly assumes to be the record of a Divine revelation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">While he was yet speaking</span>; literally, <span class="accented">he</span> <span class="accented">yet speaking</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, LXX. The writer hurries his words to express the rapidity with which one announcement followed another (see vers. 17, 18). <span class="cmt_word">There came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven.</span> "The fire of God" is undoubtedly lightning (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-1.htm">Numbers 11:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-10.htm">2 Kings 1:10, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-21.htm">Psalm 78:21</a>). This Satan, under permission, might wield, as being "the prince of the power of the air" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>): but there is, no doubt, something very extraordinary in a storm extending over the pastures occupied by nine thousand sheep, and destroying the whole of them (Cook) Still, it cannot be said that such a storm is impossible; and perhaps the damage done was not greater than that which followed on the seventh Egyptian plague (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-18.htm">Exodus 9:18-26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And hath burned up the sheep, and the servants</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the young men</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the shepherds who were in attendance upon the sheep. <span class="cmt_word">And consumed them</span>; literally, <span class="accented">devoured them.</span> Fire is often said to "devour" what it destroys. "The Egyptians," says Herodotus, "believe fire to be a live animal, which eats whatever it can seize, and then, glutted with the food, dies with the matter which it feeds upon" (Herod., 3:16). <span class="cmt_word">And I only am escaped alone to tell thee</span> (see the comment on ver. 15). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:13-19 Satan brought Job's troubles upon him on the day that his children began their course of feasting. The troubles all came upon Job at once; while one messenger of evil tidings was speaking, another followed. His dearest and most valuable possessions were his ten children; news is brought him that they are killed. They were taken away when he had most need of them to comfort him under other losses. In God only have we a help present at all times.</body></html>
