The phrase probably means <span class= "ital">the angels;</span> or at all events an incident in the unseen spiritual world is referred to simultaneous with a corresponding one on earth. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-10.htm" title="For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.">1Corinthians 11:10</a>.) In the latter sense, a solemn thought is suggested by it to those who join in the public worship of God.<p><span class= "bld">Satan.</span>--The word appears in the Old Testament as the name of a specific person only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-2.htm" title="And the LORD said to Satan, The LORD rebuke you, O Satan; even the LORD that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?">Zechariah 3:2</a>, and possibly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-1.htm" title="And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.">1Chronicles 21:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-6.htm" title="Set you a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.">Psalm 109:6</a>. If this psalm is David's, according to the inscription, no reliance can be placed on speculations as to the late introduction of a belief in Satan among the Jews, nor, therefore, on any as to the lateness of these early chapters of Job. Precisely the same word is used, apparently as a common name, in the history of Balaam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-22.htm" title="And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his ass, and his two servants were with him.">Numbers 22:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-32.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD said to him, Why have you smitten your ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand you, because your way is perverse before me:">Numbers 22:32</a>), also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-4.htm" title="And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said to him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which you have appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for with which should he reconcile himself to his master? should it not be with the heads of these men?">1Samuel 29:4</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-4.htm" title="But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil result.">1Kings 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm" title="And the LORD stirred up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.">1Kings 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-23.htm" title="And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:">1Kings 11:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-25.htm" title="And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.">1Kings 11:25</a>, where it can hardly be otherwise. Here only and in Zechariah it is found with the definite article "the adversary." The theory of the personality of the evil one must largely depend upon the view we take of these and other passages of Scripture as containing an authoritative revelation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord</span>. By "the sons of God" it is generally admitted that, in this place, the angels are meant (so again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a>). The meaning of the phrase is probably different in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2</a>. Angels and men are alike "sons of God," as created by him, in his image, to obey and serve him. Christ, the "Only Begotten," is his Son in quite a different sense. We may gather, perhaps, from this place and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-1.htm">Job 2:1</a> that there are fixed times at which the angelic host, often sent out by the Almighty on distant errands, has to gather together, one and all, before the great white throne, to pay homage to their Lord, and probably to give an account of their doings<span class="cmt_word">. And Satan came also among them</span>. The word "Satan" has the article prefixed to it <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5ea;&#x5df;</span> here and elsewhere in Job, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1, 2</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-31.htm">Luke 22:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>. Thus accompanied, it is less a proper name than an appellative - "the adversary" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-1.htm">1 Chronicles 21:1</a>, without the article, it is undoubtedly a proper name, as in the New Testament, <span class="accented">passim</span>. Accusation of men before God is one of the special offices of the evil spirit (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1, 2</a>), who is "the accuser of the brethren, he that accuses them before God day and night" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>). The accusations that he makes may be either true or false, but they are so often false that his ordinary New Testament name is <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "the Slanderer." The existence of an evil spirit must have been known to all who read or heard the story of the fall of man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.), and the descriptive epithet, "the Adversary," is likely to have been in use from a very early date. The notion that the Satan of the Old Testament is a reflex of the Persian Ahriman, and that the Jews derived their belief upon the subject from the Persians, is quite untenable. The character and position of Satan in the Hebrew system are quite unlike those of Ahriman (<span class="accented">Angro-mainyus</span>) in the religion of the Zoroastrians (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. pp. 104-113). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:6-12 Job's afflictions began from the malice of Satan, by the Lord's permission, for wise and holy purposes. There is an evil spirit, the enemy of God, and of all righteousness, who is continually seeking to distress, to lead astray, and, if possible, to destroy those who love God. How far his influence may extend, we cannot say; but probably much unsteadiness and unhappiness in Christians may be ascribed to him. While we are on this earth we are within his reach. Hence it concerns us to be sober and vigilant, 1Pe 5:8. See how Satan censures Job. This is the common way of slanderers, to suggest that which they have no reason to think is true. But as there is nothing we should dread more than really being hypocrites, so there is nothing we need dread less than being called and counted so without cause. It is not wrong to look at the eternal recompence in our obedience; but it is wrong to aim at worldly advantages in our religion. God's people are taken under his special protection; they, and all that belong to them. The blessing of the Lord makes rich; Satan himself owns it. God suffered Job to be tried, as he suffered Peter to be sifted. It is our comfort that God has the devil in a chain, Re 20:1. He has no power to lead men to sin, but what they give him themselves; nor any power to afflict men, but what is given him from above. All this is here described to us after the manner of men. The Scripture speaks thus to teach us that God directs the affairs of the world.</body></html>
