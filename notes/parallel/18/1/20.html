Not till the last calamity was announced did Job stir. The loss of his wealth little moved him. But when he heard that his children were destroyed, all of them "at one fell swoop," then he could endure no longer, but rose from the seat on which he was sitting, and showed forth his grief. <span class="cmt_word">First he rent his mantle</span>, "the outer robe worn by men of rank" (Cook) - a customary sign of grief in the ancient world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-29.htm">Genesis 37:29, 34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-13.htm">Genesis 44:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-1.htm">2 Kings 19:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-1.htm">Esther 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>; Herod., 8:99; Livy, 1:13, etc.); <span class="cmt_word">then he shaved his head</span> - another less usual but still not uncommon sign of grief, forbidden under the Law of the Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>), but widely practised by the Gentiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-5.htm">Jeremiah 47:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-37.htm">Jeremiah 48:37</a>; Herod., 2:36; 9:24; Plut.,'Vit.

After giving vent to his natural grief, Job made an act of adoration. Recognizing the fact that adversity, as well as prosperity comes from God, and submitting himself to the Divine will, he "worshipped." How often has his act flashed across the minds of Christians. and enabled them, in their dark hour, to imitate him, and repeat his words, "The Lord gave," etc.! <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:20-22 Job humbled himself under the hand of God. He reasons from the common state of human life, which he describes. We brought nothing of this world's goods into the world, but have them from others; and it is certain we can carry nothing out, but must leave them to others. Job, under all his losses, is but reduced to his first state. He is but where he must have been at last, and is only unclothed, or unloaded rather, a little sooner than he expected. If we put off our clothes before we go to bed, it is some inconvenience, but it may be the better borne when it is near bed-time. The same who gave hath taken away. See how Job looks above instruments, and keeps his eye upon the First Cause. Afflictions must not divert us from, but quicken us to religion. If in all our troubles we look to the Lord, he will support us. The Lord is righteous. All we have is from his gift; we have forfeited it by sin, and ought not to complain if he takes any part from us. Discontent and impatience charge God with folly. Against these Job carefully watched; and so must we, acknowledging that as God has done right, but we have done wickedly, so God has done wisely, but we have done very foolishly. And may the malice and power of Satan render that Saviour more precious to our souls, who came to destroy the works of the devil; who, for our salvation, suffered from that enemy far more than Job suffered, or we can think.</body></html>
