see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-1.htm" title="There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.">Job 1:1</a>). This name reappears in the classic Carduchia and in the modern Kurdistan, as well as in the more familiar Chaldaea; it being a well-known philological law that <span class= "ital">r </span>and <span class= "ital">l </span>and <span class= "ital">r </span>and <span class= "ital">s</span> are interchangeable. It is to be noted that this calamity arose from the opposite quarter to the last, illustrating the well-known fact that troubles never come alone, and that causes of a widely different nature seem to combine to overthrow the falling man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">While he was yet speaking, there came also another</span> (see the comment on ver. 16). The exact repetition of a clause, without the alteration of a word or a letter, is very archaic (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-4.htm">Genesis 1:4, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31</a>; and for another repetition, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-10.htm">Genesis 1:10, 12, 18, 21, 25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And said, The Chaldeans</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the Casdim</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), which is the word uniformly used in the Hebrew where the Authorized Version has "Chaldeans" or "Chaldees." The native name seems to have been <span class="accented">Kaldi</span> or <span class="accented">Kaldai</span>, whence the Greek <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, and the Latin <span class="accented">Chaldaei.</span> It is very difficult to account for the Hebrews having substituted a sibilant for the liquid; but it was certainly done from the earliest period of their literature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>) to the latest (see Targums, <span class="accented">passim</span>). Some derive the Hebrew <span class="accented">Casdim</span> from "Chesed," one of the sons of Nahor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-22.htm">Genesis 22:22</a>); but Abraham left Ur of the Chaldees before Chesed was born (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-20.htm">Genesis 22:20</a>). And there is no evidence of any connection between Chesed, who was born at Haran, and the Babylonian Chaldeans. The Chaldeans were probably early settlers in Babylonia; by degrees they were pressed to the south, and gave the name of Chaldea to Lower Babylonia, or the tract nearest to the Persian Gulf (Strab., 16:1, &sect; 66; Ptolemy, 'Geographia,' 5:20). From a remote date they were a settled and civilized people; but no doubt originally they had the same predatory instincts as their neighbours<span class="cmt_word">. Made out three bands</span>. Professor Lee translates, "appointed three captains," which is a possible meaning of the words; but the weight of authority supports the rendering of the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_word">And fell upon the camels</span>. Perhaps the most valuable part of Job's possessions. Three thousand camels would be regarded as a splendid capture by any body of Oriental marauders. <span class="cmt_word">And have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants</span> (literally, the <span class="accented">young men</span>, as in ver. 16) <span class="cmt_word">with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee</span> (compare the comment on ver. 15). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:13-19 Satan brought Job's troubles upon him on the day that his children began their course of feasting. The troubles all came upon Job at once; while one messenger of evil tidings was speaking, another followed. His dearest and most valuable possessions were his ten children; news is brought him that they are killed. They were taken away when he had most need of them to comfort him under other losses. In God only have we a help present at all times.</body></html>
