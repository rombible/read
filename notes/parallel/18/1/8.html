(comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-22.htm">Isaiah 41:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-5.htm">Haggai 1:5, 7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">My servant Job</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "my <span class="accented">true</span> servant, faithful in all that he does" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5</a>). It is a high honour to any man for God to acknowledge him as his servant (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-2.htm">Joshua 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-13.htm">1 Kings 11:13</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">That there is none like him in the earth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for there is none like him</span> (see the Revised Version). This is given as a reason why Satan should have paid special attention to his case, and is a sort of challenge: "Thou that art always spying out some defect or other in a righteous man, hast thou noted my servant Job, and discovered any fault in him?" <span class="cmt_word">A perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil</span> (see the comment on ver. 1). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:6-12 Job's afflictions began from the malice of Satan, by the Lord's permission, for wise and holy purposes. There is an evil spirit, the enemy of God, and of all righteousness, who is continually seeking to distress, to lead astray, and, if possible, to destroy those who love God. How far his influence may extend, we cannot say; but probably much unsteadiness and unhappiness in Christians may be ascribed to him. While we are on this earth we are within his reach. Hence it concerns us to be sober and vigilant, 1Pe 5:8. See how Satan censures Job. This is the common way of slanderers, to suggest that which they have no reason to think is true. But as there is nothing we should dread more than really being hypocrites, so there is nothing we need dread less than being called and counted so without cause. It is not wrong to look at the eternal recompence in our obedience; but it is wrong to aim at worldly advantages in our religion. God's people are taken under his special protection; they, and all that belong to them. The blessing of the Lord makes rich; Satan himself owns it. God suffered Job to be tried, as he suffered Peter to be sifted. It is our comfort that God has the devil in a chain, Re 20:1. He has no power to lead men to sin, but what they give him themselves; nor any power to afflict men, but what is given him from above. All this is here described to us after the manner of men. The Scripture speaks thus to teach us that God directs the affairs of the world.</body></html>
