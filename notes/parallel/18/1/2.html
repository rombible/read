The numbers three and seven, and their product, ten, are certainly sacred numbers, regarded as expressive of ideal perfection. But this does not prevent their being also historical. As Canon Cook observes, "Striking coincidences between outward facts and ideal numbers are not uncommon in the purely historical portions of Scripture" ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 20). There are <span class="accented">twelve</span> apostles, <span class="accented">seventy</span> (7 &times; 10) disciples sent out by our Lord, <span class="accented">seven</span> deacons, three synoptic Gospels, <span class="accented">twelve</span> minor prophets, seven princes of Persia and Media, ten sons of Haman, three of Noah, Gomer, Terah, Levi, and Zeruiah, <span class="accented">seven</span> of Japhet, Mizraim, Seir the Horite, Gad, and Jesse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-13.htm">1 Chronicles 2:13-15</a>), <span class="accented">twelve</span> of Ishmael, <span class="accented">twelve</span> of Jacob, etc. Our Lord is <span class="accented">thirty</span> (3 x 10) years old when he begins to teach, and his ministry lasts <span class="accented">three</span> years; he heals <span class="accented">seven</span> lepers, casts out of Mary Magdalene <span class="accented">seven</span> devils, speaks upon the cross <span class="accented">seven</span> "words," bids Peter forgive his brother "<span class="accented">seventy</span> times seven," etc. It is thus not only in vision or in prophecy, or in symbolical language, that these "ideal numbers" come to the front far more frequently than ethers, but also in the most matter-of-fact histories. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 Job was prosperous, and yet pious. Though it is hard and rare, it is not impossible for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. By God's grace the temptations of worldly wealth may be overcome. The account of Job's piety and prosperity comes before the history of his great afflictions, showing that neither will secure from troubles. While Job beheld the harmony and comforts of his sons with satisfaction, his knowledge of the human heart made him fearful for them. He sent and sanctified them, reminding them to examine themselves, to confess their sins, to seek forgiveness; and as one who hoped for acceptance with God through the promised Saviour, he offered a burnt-offering for each. We perceive his care for their souls, his knowledge of the sinful state of man, his entire dependence on God's mercy in the way he had appointed.</body></html>
