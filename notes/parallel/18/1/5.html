(Comp. <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>our "cleave to" and "cleave.") The use of <span class= "ital">bless </span>in the sense of <span class= "ital">curse </span>may be a euphemism, or it may arise from giving to it the meaning of <span class= "ital">saluting </span>or <span class= "ital">bidding farewell to, </span>and so <span class= "ital">dismissing. </span>This use is not elsewhere found than in the passages cited above.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about</span>; rather, <span class="accented">when the days of the feasting had come round</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whenever one of the birthdays had arrived in due course, and the feasting had taken place. That Job sent and sanctified them. In the old world, outside the Mosaic Law, the father of the family was the priest, to whom alone it belonged to bless, purify, and offer sacrifice. Job, after each birthday-feast, sent, it would seem, for his sons, and purified them by the accustomed ablutions, or possibly by some other ceremonial process, regarding it as probable that, in the course of their feasting, they had contracted some defilement. It would seem by the next clause that the purification took place at the close of the day of festivity. <span class="cmt_word">And rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings</span>. Burnt offerings were instituted soon after the Fall, as we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4</a>, and were in common use long before the Mosaic Law was given (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-8.htm">Genesis 22:8, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-54.htm">Genesis 31:54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-12.htm">Exodus 18:12</a>; 'Records of the Past,' vol. 2. pp. 20, 21; vol. 12. pp. 49, 71, etc.). The practice was common, so far as appears, to all the nations of antiquity, except the Persians (Herod., 1:132). According to the number of them all One, apparently, for each child, since each might have sinned in the way suggested. The offerings were clearly it. tended as expiatory. <span class="cmt_word">For Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts</span>. Two wholly different meanings are assigned by good Hebraists to the expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. According to some, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span> has its usual sense, "to bless," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> signifies "false gods," or "idols;" according to the others, who form the great majority, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> has its usual sense of "God," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span> has the unusual sense of "curse" (so Buxtorf, Rosenmuller, Schultens, (Cook, Stanley Leathes, among moderns, and among ancient authorities, the Septuagint and the Vulgate). How the same word comes to have the two wholly opposite senses of "to bless" and "to curse" has been differently explained. Some think that, as men blessed their friends both on receiving them and on bidding them adieu, the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span> got the sense of "bidding adieu to," "dismissing," "renouncing." Others regard the use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span> for "to curse" as a mere euphemism, and compare the use of <span class="accented">sacer</span> and <span class="accented">sacrari</span> in Latin, and such expressions as "<span class="accented">Bless</span> the stupid man!" "What a <span class="accented">blessed</span> nuisance!" in English. The maledictory sense seems to be established by <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-9.htm">Job 2:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-10.htm">1 Kings 21:10</a>. By "cursing God in their hearts" Job probably means "forgetting him," "putting him out of sight," "not giving him the honour which is his due." <span class="cmt_word">Thus did Job continually</span>; literally, as in the margin, <span class="accented">all the days</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whenever one of the festival-days occurred. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 Job was prosperous, and yet pious. Though it is hard and rare, it is not impossible for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. By God's grace the temptations of worldly wealth may be overcome. The account of Job's piety and prosperity comes before the history of his great afflictions, showing that neither will secure from troubles. While Job beheld the harmony and comforts of his sons with satisfaction, his knowledge of the human heart made him fearful for them. He sent and sanctified them, reminding them to examine themselves, to confess their sins, to seek forgiveness; and as one who hoped for acceptance with God through the promised Saviour, he offered a burnt-offering for each. We perceive his care for their souls, his knowledge of the sinful state of man, his entire dependence on God's mercy in the way he had appointed.</body></html>
