Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest on me.">2Corinthians 12:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm" title="Why we would have come to you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.">1Thessalonians 2:18</a>, &c.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in thy hand, as</span> in the margin. God withdraws his protection from Job's possessions; he does not himself take them away, as Satan had suggested (ver. 11); but he allows Satan, who can do nothing without his allowance, to deal with them as he pleases. As God dispenses blessings through the angelic host (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>), so he, sometimes at any rate, allows spirits of evil to be the ministers of his chastisements. <span class="cmt_word">Only upon himself put not forth thine hand</span>. The <span class="accented">person</span> of Job was not to be touched as yet. He was to be injured only in his belongings. <span class="cmt_word">So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord</span>. Having obtained a permission which he thought would serve his purpose, Satan did not delay, but promptly departed, to take advantage of the permission given him. To be in the presence of God must be an intense pain to the evil one. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:6-12 Job's afflictions began from the malice of Satan, by the Lord's permission, for wise and holy purposes. There is an evil spirit, the enemy of God, and of all righteousness, who is continually seeking to distress, to lead astray, and, if possible, to destroy those who love God. How far his influence may extend, we cannot say; but probably much unsteadiness and unhappiness in Christians may be ascribed to him. While we are on this earth we are within his reach. Hence it concerns us to be sober and vigilant, 1Pe 5:8. See how Satan censures Job. This is the common way of slanderers, to suggest that which they have no reason to think is true. But as there is nothing we should dread more than really being hypocrites, so there is nothing we need dread less than being called and counted so without cause. It is not wrong to look at the eternal recompence in our obedience; but it is wrong to aim at worldly advantages in our religion. God's people are taken under his special protection; they, and all that belong to them. The blessing of the Lord makes rich; Satan himself owns it. God suffered Job to be tried, as he suffered Peter to be sifted. It is our comfort that God has the devil in a chain, Re 20:1. He has no power to lead men to sin, but what they give him themselves; nor any power to afflict men, but what is given him from above. All this is here described to us after the manner of men. The Scripture speaks thus to teach us that God directs the affairs of the world.</body></html>
