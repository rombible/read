It is probably the second who is referred to here, whose descendants led a predatory and marauding kind of life in the country bordering on that of Job. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-13.htm" title="Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say to you, Are you come to take a spoil? have you gathered your company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?">Ezekiel 38:13</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Sabeans</span> (literally, Sheba) <span class="cmt_word">fell upon them, and took them away</span>. The Sabeans were the principal people of Arabia in ancient times, and the name seems to be used sometimes in the general sense of "Arabs" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>). We may suppose that hem, either the general sense is intended, or, if the specific one, then that, at the date whereto the story of Job belongs, there were Sabeans in Eastern as well as in Southern Arabia, in the neighbourhood of the Upper Persian Gulf as well as in the neighbourhood of the Indian Ocean. The plundering habits of all the Arab tribes are well known. Strabo says that the Sabeans, even at the height of their prosperity, made excursions for the sake of plunder into Arabia Petraea and even Syria (Strab., 16:4) <span class="cmt_word">Yea, they have slain</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they slew</span>, or <span class="accented">they smote. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The servants</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the young men</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the labourers who were engaged in ploughing, and would be in duty bound to resist the carrying off of the cattle. <span class="cmt_word">With the edge of the sword</span>. The lance is the chief weapon of the modern Bedouin, but it may have been different anciently. Or the expression used may merely mean "with weapons of war." <span class="cmt_word">And I only am escaped alone to tell thee</span>. Professor Lee translates, "And I have <span class="accented">hardly</span> escaped alone to tell thee." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:13-19 Satan brought Job's troubles upon him on the day that his children began their course of feasting. The troubles all came upon Job at once; while one messenger of evil tidings was speaking, another followed. His dearest and most valuable possessions were his ten children; news is brought him that they are killed. They were taken away when he had most need of them to comfort him under other losses. In God only have we a help present at all times.</body></html>
