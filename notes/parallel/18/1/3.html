The Arabs still call the Hauran, or the district east of Jordan, the land of Job. It is said to be a lovely and fertile region, fulfilling the conditions of the poem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His substance also</span>; literally, <span class="accented">his acquisition</span> (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">acquirere</span>), but used of wealth generally. <span class="cmt_word">Seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses</span>. Note, first of all, the absence of horses or mules from this list - an indication of high antiquity. Horses were not known in Egypt till the time of the shepherd-kings (about <span class="date">B.C. 1900-1650</span>), who introduced them from Asia. None are given to Abraham by the Pharaoh contemporary with him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-16.htm">Genesis 12:16</a>). We hear of none as possessed by the patriarchs in Palestine; and, on the whole, it is not probable that they had been known in Western Asia very long before their introduction into Egypt. They are natives of Central Asia, where they are still found wild, and passed gradually by exportation to the more southern regions, Armenia, Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine, Arabia. Note, secondly, that the items of Job's wealth accord with those of Abraham's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-16.htm">Genesis 12:16</a>). Thirdly, note that Job's wealth in cattle is not beyond credibility. An Egyptian lord of the time of the fourth dynasty relates that he possessed above 1000 oxen and cows, 974 sheep, 2,235 goals, and 760 asses (Rawlinson's 'Egypt,' vol. 2. p. 88). Further, the proportion of the camels is noticeable, and implies a residence on the borders of the desert (see the comment on ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">and a very great household</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and a very great service</span>, or <span class="accented">retinue of servants.</span> Oriental emirs and sheikhs consider it necessary for their dignity to maintain a number of attendants and retainers (except, perhaps, in feudal times) quite unknown to the West. Abraham had three hundred and eighteen trained servants, born in his house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14</a>). Egyptian households were "full of domestics," comprising attendants of all kinds - grooms, artisans, clerks, musicians, messengers, and the like. A sheikh, situated as Job was, would also require a certain number of guards, while for his cattle he would need a large body of shepherds, ox-herds, and the like (see Birch's 'Egypt from the Earliest Times,' p. 44<span class="cmt_word">). So that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east</span>. The <span class="accented">Beney Kedem</span>, or "men of the east," literally, <span class="accented">sons of the east</span>, seems to include the entire population between Palestine and the Euphrates (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-1.htm">Genesis 29:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-12.htm">Judges 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-10.htm">Judges 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-14.htm">Isaiah 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-28.htm">Jeremiah 49:28</a>, etc.). Many tribes of Arabs are similarly designated at the present day, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the Beni Harb, the Beni Suhr, the Bani Naim, the Bani Lain, etc. It would seem that the Phoenicians must have called themselves Beni Kedem when they settled in Greece, since the Greeks knew them as "Cadmeisns," and made them descendants of a mythic "Cadreus' (Herod., 5:57-59). The name "Saracens" is to some extent analogous, since it means "Men of the morning." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 Job was prosperous, and yet pious. Though it is hard and rare, it is not impossible for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. By God's grace the temptations of worldly wealth may be overcome. The account of Job's piety and prosperity comes before the history of his great afflictions, showing that neither will secure from troubles. While Job beheld the harmony and comforts of his sons with satisfaction, his knowledge of the human heart made him fearful for them. He sent and sanctified them, reminding them to examine themselves, to confess their sins, to seek forgiveness; and as one who hoped for acceptance with God through the promised Saviour, he offered a burnt-offering for each. We perceive his care for their souls, his knowledge of the sinful state of man, his entire dependence on God's mercy in the way he had appointed.</body></html>
