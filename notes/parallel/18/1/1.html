Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.">Genesis 10:23</a>, where Uz is said to have been one of the sons of Aram, who was one of the sons of Shem. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-17.htm" title="The sons of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram, and Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Meshech.">1Chronicles 1:17</a>.) Another Uz (in the Authorised Version spelt Huz) is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-21.htm" title="Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,">Genesis 22:21</a> as the firstborn of Nahor, the brother of Abraham. A third form of this name is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-28.htm" title="The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.">Genesis 36:28</a> among "the sons of Seir the Horite. who inhabited the land" of Edom. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-42.htm" title="The sons of Ezer; Bilhan, and Zavan, and Jakan. The sons of Dishan; Uz, and Aran.">1Chronicles 1:42</a>.) It is probable that each of these is to be associated with a different district: the first perhaps with that of the Lebanon--a district near Damascus is still called El-Ghutha; the second with that of Mesopotamia or Chaldea; and the third with the Edomite district south of Palestine. From the mention of "the land of Uz" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-21.htm" title="Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwell in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through to you: you shall be drunken, and shall make yourself naked.">Lamentations 4:21</a>) and "the kings of the land of Uz" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-20.htm" title="And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,">Jeremiah 25:20</a>), where in each case the association seems to be with Edom, it is probable that the land of Job is to be identified rather with the district south and southeast of Palestine.<p><span class= "bld">Whose name was Job.</span>--The name is really <span class= "ital">Iyyov, </span>and is carefully to be distinguished from the Job (<span class= "ital">Yov</span>) who was the son of Issachar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-13.htm" title="And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.">Genesis 46:13</a>), and from the Jobab (<span class= "ital">Yovav</span>) who was one of the kings of Edom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-33.htm" title="And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.">Genesis 36:33</a>), with both of which it has been confounded. The form of the name may suggest the signification of "the assaulted one," as the root from which it appears to be derived means "was an enemy."<p><span class= "bld">Perfect and upright . . .</span>--Noah in like manner is said to have been "perfect" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-9.htm" title="These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.">Genesis 6:9</a>). Abram was required to be so (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-1.htm" title="And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said to him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be you perfect.">Genesis 17:1</a>), and Israel generally (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-13.htm" title="You shall be perfect with the LORD your God.">Deuteronomy 18:13</a>), though the adjective in these places is not quite the same as that used here; and our Lord required the same high standard of His disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-48.htm" title="Be you therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.">Matthew 5:48</a>), while He also, through the gift of the Spirit, made it possible. The character here given to Job is that in which wisdom is declared to consist. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-28.htm" title="And to man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.">Job 28:28</a>.) It has the twofold aspect of refusing the evil and choosing the good, of aiming at a lofty ideal of excellence and of shunning that which is fatal or opposed to it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was a man</span>. This opening presents to us the Book of Job as a detached work, separate from and independent of all others. The historical books are generally united each to each by the <span class="accented">you</span> connective. In the land of Us. Uz, or Huz (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e5;</span>), seems to have been originally, like Judah, Moab, Ammon, Edom, etc., the name of a man. It was borne by a son of Nahor, the brother of Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-21.htm">Genesis 22:21</a>), and again by a son of Dishan, the son of Seir the Horite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-28.htm">Genesis 36:28</a>). Some regard it as also a personal name in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-23.htm">Genesis 10:23</a>. But from this use it passed to the descendants of one or more of these patriarchs, and from them to the country or countries which they inhabited. The "land of Uz" is spoken of, not only in this passage, but also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-20.htm">Jeremiah 25:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-21.htm">Lamentations 4:21</a>. These last-cited places seem to show that Jeremiah's "land of Uz" was in or near Edom, and therefore south of Palestine; but as Uzzites, like so many nations of these ports, were migratory, we need not be surprised if the name Uz was, at different times, attached to various localities. Arabian tradition regards the region of the Hauran, north-east of Palestine, as Job's country. The other geographical names in the Book of Job point to a more eastern location, one not far remote from the southern Euphrates, and the adjacent parts of Arabia Sheba, Dedan, Teman, Buz, Shuah, and Chesed (Casdim) all point to this locality. On the other hand, there is a passage in the inscriptions of Asshur-banipal (circ. <span class="date">B.C. 650-625</span>) which, associating together the names of Huz and Buz (Khazu and Bazu), appears to place them both in Central Arabia, not far from the Jebel Shnmmar ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 470). My own conclusion would be that, while the name "land of Uz" designated at various periods various localities, Job's "land of Uz" lay a little west of the Lower Euphrates, on the borders of Chaldea and Arabia. <span class="cmt_word">Whose name was Job</span>. In the Hebrew the name is "Iyyob," whence the "Eyoub" of the Arabs and the "Hiob" of the Germans. It is quite a distinct name from that of the third son of Issachar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-18.htm">Genesis 46:18</a>), which is properly expressed by "Job," being <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span>. <span class="accented">Iyyob is</span> supposed to be derived from <span class="accented">aib</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;</span>), "to be hostile," and to mean "cruelly or hostilely treated," in which ease we must suppose it to have been first given to the patriarch in his later life, and to have superseded some other, as "Peter" superseded "Simon," and "Paul" superseded "Saul." According to a Jewish tradition, adopted by some of the Christian Fathers, Job's original name was "Jobab," and under this name he reigned as King of Edom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-33.htm">Genesis 36:33</a>). But this kingship is scarcely compatible with the view given of him in the Book of Job. The supposed connection of the name of Juba with that of Job is very doubtful. <span class="cmt_word">And that man was perfect</span><span class="accented">. Tam</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>), the word translated "perfect," seems to mean "complete, entire, not wanting in any respect," It corresponds to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and the Latin <span class="accented">integer</span> (comp. Horace, 'Od.,' 1:22. 1, "Integer vitro, scelerisque purus'). It does not mean" absolutely sinless," which Job was not (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-20.htm">Job 9:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-4.htm">Job 40:4</a>). And upright. This is the exact meaning of <span class="accented">yashar</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>). "The Book of Jasher" was "the Book of the Upright" (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-18.htm">2 Samuel 1:18</a>). One that feared God, and eschewed evil; literally, <span class="accented">fearing God and departing from evil</span>. The same testimony is given of Job by God himself in ver. 8, and again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-3.htm">Job 2:3</a> (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14, 20</a>). We must suppose Job to have reached as near perfection as was possible tot man at the time. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 Job was prosperous, and yet pious. Though it is hard and rare, it is not impossible for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. By God's grace the temptations of worldly wealth may be overcome. The account of Job's piety and prosperity comes before the history of his great afflictions, showing that neither will secure from troubles. While Job beheld the harmony and comforts of his sons with satisfaction, his knowledge of the human heart made him fearful for them. He sent and sanctified them, reminding them to examine themselves, to confess their sins, to seek forgiveness; and as one who hoped for acceptance with God through the promised Saviour, he offered a burnt-offering for each. We perceive his care for their souls, his knowledge of the sinful state of man, his entire dependence on God's mercy in the way he had appointed.</body></html>
