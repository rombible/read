All the secrets of this mysterious, invisible, and undiscoverable world are naked and open before Him--the grave lies naked and destruction is uncovered.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-14.</span> - Job now turns from controversy to the realities of the case, and begins with a full acknowledgment of God's greatness, might, and inscrutableness. As Bildad seemed to have supposed that he needed enlightenment on these points (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-2.htm">Job 26:2-4</a>), Job may have thought it right to make once more a plain profession of his belief (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-4.htm">Job 9:4-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-9.htm">Job 12:9-25</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Dead things are formed from under the waters</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the dead from under the waters tremble.</span> Hehraists generally are agreed that one of the meanings of Rephaim (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) is "the dead" or the departed, considered especially as inhabitants of Hades (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-11.htm">Psalm 88:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-18.htm">Proverbs 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-14.htm">Isaiah 26:14</a>). And if so, this meaning is certainly appropriate here. Blidad had illustrated God's dominion from his power in heaven. Job shows that it exists alike in heaven and earth (vers. 7-13), and in the region under the earth (vers. 5, 6). There, in Sheol, under the waters of the ocean, the dead tremble at the thought of the Most High; they tremble together with other inhabitants thereof, as evil spirits, rebel intelligences, east down to Hades, and there held in durance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:5-14 Many striking instances are here given of the wisdom and power of God, in the creation and preservation of the world. If we look about us, to the earth and waters here below, we see his almighty power. If we consider hell beneath, though out of our sight, yet we may conceive the discoveries of God's power there. If we look up to heaven above, we see displays of God's almighty power. By his Spirit, the eternal Spirit that moved upon the face of the waters, the breath of his mouth, Ps 33:6, he has not only made the heavens, but beautified them. By redemption, all the other wonderful works of the Lord are eclipsed; and we may draw near, and taste his grace, learn to love him, and walk with delight in his ways. The ground of the controversy between Job and the other disputants was, that they unjustly thought from his afflictions that he must have been guilty of heinous crimes. They appear not to have duly considered the evil and just desert of original sin; nor did they take into account the gracious designs of God in purifying his people. Job also darkened counsel by words without knowledge. But his views were more distinct. He does not appear to have alleged his personal righteousness as the ground of his hope towards God. Yet what he admitted in a general view of his case, he in effect denied, while he complained of his sufferings as unmerited and severe; that very complaint proving the necessity for their being sent, in order to his being further humbled in the sight of God.</body></html>
