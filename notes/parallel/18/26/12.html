According to our view of this matter will be the indication derived therefrom of the date of Job.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He divideth the sea with his power</span>. "Divideth" is certainly a wrong translation. The verb used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5be;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>) means either "stirreth up" or "stilleth." In favour of the former rendering are Rosen-muller, Schultens, Delitzsch, Merx, and Canon Cook; in favour of the latter, the LXX., Dillmann, and Dr. Stanley Leathes. In either case the general sentiment is that God has full mastery over the sea, and can regulate its movements at his pleasure. <span class="cmt_word">And by his understanding he smiteth through the proud</span>; literally, he <span class="accented">smiteth through Rahab.</span> (On Rahab, as the great power of evil, see the comment on Job 9:13.) God is said to have "smitten him through <span class="accented">by his understanding</span>" since in the contest between good and evil it is rather intelligence than mere force that carries the day. Power alone is sufficient to control the sea. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:5-14 Many striking instances are here given of the wisdom and power of God, in the creation and preservation of the world. If we look about us, to the earth and waters here below, we see his almighty power. If we consider hell beneath, though out of our sight, yet we may conceive the discoveries of God's power there. If we look up to heaven above, we see displays of God's almighty power. By his Spirit, the eternal Spirit that moved upon the face of the waters, the breath of his mouth, Ps 33:6, he has not only made the heavens, but beautified them. By redemption, all the other wonderful works of the Lord are eclipsed; and we may draw near, and taste his grace, learn to love him, and walk with delight in his ways. The ground of the controversy between Job and the other disputants was, that they unjustly thought from his afflictions that he must have been guilty of heinous crimes. They appear not to have duly considered the evil and just desert of original sin; nor did they take into account the gracious designs of God in purifying his people. Job also darkened counsel by words without knowledge. But his views were more distinct. He does not appear to have alleged his personal righteousness as the ground of his hope towards God. Yet what he admitted in a general view of his case, he in effect denied, while he complained of his sufferings as unmerited and severe; that very complaint proving the necessity for their being sent, in order to his being further humbled in the sight of God.</body></html>
