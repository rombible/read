Job has put away the feelings of shame and diffidence, which were predominant with him when he said, "How should man be just with God? If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2, 3</a>); and again, "How much less shall I answer him, and cheese out my words to reason with him? Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer; but I would make my supplication to my Judge" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-14.htm">Job 9:14, 15</a>). He now wishes to contend and argue and reason. This is quite in accordance with our experience. Many am the moods of man - various and conflicting his desires! His mind never continues long in one stay. <span class="cmt_word">And fill my mouth with arguments</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-14.htm">Psalm 38:14</a>, where our translators render the same word by "reproofs," but where "arguments" or "pleadings" would be more appropriate). The LXX. has there <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, and in the present passage <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. The word is forensic. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-7 Job appeals from his friends to the just judgement of God. He wants to have his cause tried quickly. Blessed be God, we may know where to find him. He is in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself; and upon a mercy-seat, waiting to be gracious. Thither the sinner may go; and there the believer may order his cause before Him, with arguments taken from his promises, his covenant, and his glory. A patient waiting for death and judgment is our wisdom and duty, and it cannot be without a holy fear and trembling. A passionate wishing for death or judgement is our sin and folly, and ill becomes us, as it did Job.</body></html>
