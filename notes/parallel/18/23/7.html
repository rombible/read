Job's case teaches us that if an innocent man is falsely accused, God's honour is vindicated and maintained by his holding fast his conviction of innocence rather than by his yielding to the pressure of adversity and owning to sins he has not committed, or relaxing his hold on innocence by yielding to irritability.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/job/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There the righteous might dispute with him</span>. There, before his high tribunal (ver. 3), the upright man (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e8;</span>) might argue or reason with him, appealing from his justice to his mercy - from God the Judge to God the Saviour (Loathes), vindicating his integrity, acknowledging his transgressions, and pleading that they were sins of infirmity-and at last obtaining from God the acquittal anticipated in the second clause of the verse. In the absence of any revelation of an Advocate who will plead our cause before God for us, Job would seem to have been justified in expecting such a liberty of pleading his own cause as he here sets forth<span class="cmt_word">. So should I be delivered for ever from my Judge</span>. The "Judge of all the earth" will certainly and necessarily "do right." Job's conscience testifies to his substantial integrity and uprightness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-21.htm">1 John 3:21</a>). He is, therefore, confident that, if he can once bring his cause to God's cognizance, he will obtain acquittal and deliverance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/job/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-7 Job appeals from his friends to the just judgement of God. He wants to have his cause tried quickly. Blessed be God, we may know where to find him. He is in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself; and upon a mercy-seat, waiting to be gracious. Thither the sinner may go; and there the believer may order his cause before Him, with arguments taken from his promises, his covenant, and his glory. A patient waiting for death and judgment is our wisdom and duty, and it cannot be without a holy fear and trembling. A passionate wishing for death or judgement is our sin and folly, and ill becomes us, as it did Job.</body></html>
