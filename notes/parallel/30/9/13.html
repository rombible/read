Under the figure of a supernatural fertility are represented the victories of grace (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-10.htm">Ezekiel 26:10</a>, etc.; Ezekiel 34:25, etc.). The blessing is founded on the Mosaic promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-5.htm">Leviticus 26:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The ploughman shall overtake the reaper.</span> Ploughing and harvest shall be continuous, without sensible interval. <span class="cmt_word">The treader of grapes him that soweth seed.</span> The vintage should be so abundant that it should last till sowing time. <span class="cmt_word">The mountains shall drop sweet wine.</span> This is from <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-18.htm">Joel 3:18</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And all the hills shall melt.</span> As Joel says, "shall flow with milk," in this promised land "flowing with milk and honey."

For, as Corn. a Lapide quotes, "Bacchus amat colles" (Virg., 'Georg.,' 2:113). The hyperbolical expressions in the text are not to be taken literally; they depict in bright colours the blessings of the kingdom of Messiah. Material and temporal blessings are generally represented as closely connected with spiritual, and as figurative of them. Such predictions, understood literally, are common in the so called Sibylline Books; see <span class="accented">e.g.</span> lib. 3:743, etc., where, among other prodigies, we have - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> One is reminded of the golden age depicted by Virgil in his fourth eclogue. Trochon cites Claudian, 'In Rufin.,' 1:381, etc. - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"... nec vomere sulcus adunco<br />Findetur; subitis messor gaudebit aristis.<br />Rorabunt querceta favis; stagnantia passim<br />Vina fluent, oleique lacus."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:11-15 Christ died to gather together the children of God that were scattered abroad, here said to be those who were called by his name. The Lord saith this, who doeth this, who can do it, who has determined to do it, the power of whose grace is engaged for doing it. Verses 13-15 may refer to the early times of Christianity, but will receive a more glorious fulfilment in the events which all the prophets more or less foretold, and may be understood of the happy state when the fulness both of the Jews and the Gentiles come into the church. Let us continue earnest in prayer for the fulfilment of these prophecies, in the peace, purity, and the beauty of the church. God marvellously preserves his elect amidst the most fearful confusions and miseries. When all seems desperate, he wonderfully revives his church, and blesses her with all spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus. And great shall be the glory of that period, in which not one good thing promised shall remain unfulfilled.</body></html>
