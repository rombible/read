The prophet sees Jehovah Himself standing in pomp by the altar of burnt offering, and by His side the angel of His presence, to whom now, as on many other occasions, the mission of destruction has been entrusted. To him the words of Jehovah are addressed (so Aben Ezra, Kimchi). It is doubtful what is meant by the Hebrew <span class= "ital">Caphtor</span> (mistranslated "lintel of the door"). It may mean the wreathed capital of the columns, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-14.htm" title="And flocks shall lie down in the middle of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds; for he shall uncover the cedar work.">Zephaniah 2:14</a>. So Hitzig and Keil. The word <span class= "ital">sippim</span> (mistranslated "posts") properly signifies "thresholds," but is here understood by the first-mentioned commentator to mean the cornice supported by the columns. This is confirmed by the LXX. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-4.htm" title="And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.">Isaiah 6:4</a> (see Delitzsch <span class= "ital">ad loc</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> But as there is no mention of the temple building, but only of the altar of burnt offering, it is much safer to adhere to the ordinary and well-established significations of these terms. We should accordingly follow Ewald in taking <span class= "ital">Caphtor</span> as referring to the <span class= "ital">ornamented horns of the altar.</span> Similarly, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-31.htm" title="And you shall make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.">Exodus 25:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/37-17.htm" title="And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, were of the same:">Exodus 37:17</a>, it signifies the richly decorated extremities of the golden <span class= "ital">candelabra.</span> The scene is wonderfully vivid. Round the colossal altar of burnt offering a crowd of eager devotees is gathered. Jehovah gives the word of command to His angel, and with a blow that shakes the very threshold the ornamented altar horns are shivered to fragments, which are hurled down upon the panic-stricken multitude below.<p><span class= "bld">And cut</span> . . .--Rather, <span class= "ital">and dash them in pieces upon the head of all of them.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-10.</span> - &sect; 6<span class="accented">. The fifth vision displays the Lord standing by the altar and</span> commanding the destruction of the temple (ver. 1). No one shall escape this judgment, flee whither he will (vers. 2-4); for God is Almighty (vers. 5, 6). Their election shall not save the guilty Israelites; still they shall not be utterly destroyed (vers. 7-10). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I saw the Lord.</span> It is now no longer a mere emblem that the prophet sees, but actual destruction. He beholds the majesty of God, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Upon</span> (or, by) <span class="cmt_word">the altar;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the altar of burnt offering at Jerusalem, Where, it is supposed, the whole nation, Israelites and Judaeans, are assembled for worship. It is natural, at first sight, to suppose that the sanctuary of the northern kingdom is the scene of this vision, as the destruction of idolatry is here emblemized; but more probably Bethel is not meant, for there were more altars than one there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-14.htm">Amos 3:14</a>), and one cannot imagine the Lord standing by the symbol of the calf worship. <span class="cmt_word">Smite</span>. The command is mysteriously addressed to the destroying angel (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-15.htm">2 Samuel 24:15</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The lintel of the door;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">cardinem</span> (Vulgate); better, <span class="accented">the chapiter</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-14.htm">Zephaniah 2:14</a>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the capital of the columns. The word <span class="accented">kaphtor</span> is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31</a>, etc., for the knop or ornament on the golden candlesticks; here the idea is that the temple receives a blow on the top of the pillars which support it sufficient to cause its overthrow. The LXX. rendering arises from a confusion of two Hebrew words somewhat similar. <span class="cmt_word">The posts;</span> <span class="accented">the thresholds</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the base. The knop and the threshold imply the total destruction from summit to base. <span class="cmt_word">Cut them in the head, all of them;</span> rather, <span class="accented">break them</span> [<span class="accented">the capital and the thresholds</span>] <span class="accented">to pieces upon the head of all.</span> Let the falling building cover them with its ruins. The Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">avaritia enim in capite omnium</span>, confounding two words. Jerome had the same Hebrew reading, as he translates, <span class="accented">quaetus eorum, avaritia</span>, as if giving the reason for the punishment. The overthrown temple presents a forcible picture of the destruction of the theocracy. <span class="cmt_word">The last of them</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-2.htm">Amos 4:2</a>); <span class="accented">the remnant</span>; any who escape the fall of the temple. <span class="cmt_word">He that fleeth,</span> etc. All hope of escape shall be cut off. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-10 The prophet, in vision, saw the Lord standing upon the idolatrous altar at Bethel. Wherever sinners flee from God's justice, it will overtake them. Those whom God brings to heaven by his grace, shall never be cast down; but those who seek to climb thither by vain confidence in themselves, will be cast down and filled with shame. That which makes escape impossible and ruin sure, is, that God will set his eyes upon them for evil, not for good. Wretched must those be on whom the Lord looks for evil, and not for good. The Lord would scatter the Jews, and visit them with calamities, as the corn is shaken in a sieve; but he would save some from among them. The astonishing preservation of the Jews as a distinct people, seems here foretold. If professors make themselves like the world, God will level them with the world. The sinners who thus flatter themselves, shall find that their profession will not protect them.</body></html>
