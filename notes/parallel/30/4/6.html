clean, sharp, prominent teeth projecting from the thin lips. Notwithstanding their chastisement, God says, "Ye have not returned even up to me." Jehovah is here introduced as grieving over the failure of his disciplinary treatment of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - In this and the five following verses God sets forth instances of the judgments which he had sent at various times to correct Israel; viz. famine, drought, blight, pestilence, earthquake; but all had been in vain. Five times recurs the sad refrain, "Yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord." God's unwearied love had not conquered their rebellion. <span class="cmt_word">Cleanness of teeth;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "dulness of teeth;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">stuporem dentium.</span> It is not "toothache" that is meant, but famine, as is seen by the parallel term, <span class="cmt_word">want of bread</span>; as Corn. a Lapide says, "Cum enim in fame et penuria dentes non habent quod mordeant et mandant, innocentes sunt et mundi." This is the first chastisement mentioned. It was threatened in the Law as a consequence of backsliding (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-48.htm">Deuteronomy 28:48, 57</a>). The famines to which Amos alludes are not recorded. Plainly they were not fortuitous, but were providential inflictions, in accordance with previous warnings <span class="cmt_word">Yet have ye not returned unto me.</span> Pusey notes that the words imply, not that they returned not at all, but that they did after a fashion return, but not so as to reach God, their repentance being a half-repentance and their worship a half-worship, and therefore unacceptable. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:6-13 See the folly of carnal hearts; they wander from one creature to another, seeking for something to satisfy, and labour for that which satisfies not; yet, after all, they will not incline their ear to Him in whom they might find all they can want. Preaching the gospel is as rain, and every thing withers where this rain is wanting. It were well if people were as wise for their souls as they are for their bodies; and, when they have not this rain near, would go and seek it where it is to be had. As the Israelites persisted in rebellion and idolatry, the Lord was coming against them as an adversary. Ere long, we must meet our God in judgment; but we shall not be able to stand before him, if he tries us according to our doings. If we would prepare to meet our God with comfort, at the awful period of his coming, we must now meet him in Christ Jesus, the eternal Son of the Father, who came to save lost sinners. We must seek him while he is to be found.</body></html>
