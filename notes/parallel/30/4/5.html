The Law forbade leaven in any meat offering consumed by fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-11.htm">Leviticus 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12</a>); and if it allowed cakes of leavened bread to be offered on one occasion, these were not to be placed on the altar and burned, but one was to be assigned to the officiating priest, and the rest eaten at the sacrificial meal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-13.htm">Leviticus 7:13, 14</a>). The ironical charge to the Israelites is that in their unlicensed zeal they should not only burn on the altar that which was leavened, but, with the idea of being more bountiful, they should also offer by fire that which was to be set apart for other uses. The Septuagint Version can only be explained by considering the translators to have had a different reading, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "and they read the Law without." <span class="cmt_word">Proclaim... publish.</span> Make public proclamation that free will offerings are to be made, or else, like the Pharisees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-2.htm">Matthew 6:2</a>), announce with ostentation that you are about to offer. The essence of such offerings was that they should be voluntary, not of command or compulsion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-18.htm">Leviticus 22:18</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-6.htm">Deuteronomy 12:6</a>). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "and called for public professions" (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-6.htm">Deuteronomy 12:6, 17, 18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">This liketh you;</span> <span class="accented">this ye love</span>; Septuagint, "Proclaim ye that the children of Israel loved these things." Their whole heart was set on this will worship. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-5 What is got by extortion is commonly used to provide for the flesh, and to fulfil the lusts thereof. What is got by oppression cannot be enjoyed with satisfaction. How miserable are those whose confidence in unscriptural observances only prove that they believe a lie! Let us see to it that our faith, hope, and worship, are warranted by the Divine word.</body></html>
