Hence the transition in thought to the next clause is natural. This is curiously rendered in LXX.

The mountains are mentioned as the most solid and everlasting of his works; <span class="cmt_word">the wind,</span> as the subtlest and most immaterial of created things. <span class="cmt_word">Declareth unto man what is his thought;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> man's thought; reveals man to himself shows that he knows man's thought before man puts it into words. This he does sometimes by the stings of conscience, sometimes by inspiring his prophets to declare men's secret motives and the real state of their heart (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>, l0; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-20.htm">1 John 3:20</a>). Vulgate, <span class="accented">Annuntians homini eloquium suum</span>, where <span class="accented">eloquium is</span> equivalent to <span class="accented">cognitatio</span>. The LXX., with some change of letters, has, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "proclaiming unto men his Christ" - a reading which supports the misinterpretation of "his thought" as meaning God's thought, Christ being regarded as the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of God. Many of the Fathers have seen here a prophesy of the Messiah. See Tirinus and Corn. a Lapide on this verse. <span class="cmt_word">That maketh the morning darkness.</span> Keil, after Calvin, takes these words as asyndeton for "the morning dawn and darkness." So the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, "making morning and gloom." This would be simply a further instance of God's creative power. The Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">faciens matutinam nebulam</span>; and it seems probable (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-8.htm">Amos 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>) that the clause means that the Lord turns the dawn into darkness. This may refer to the action of clouds or an eclipse; or it may be said metaphorically of prosperity and adversity. <span class="cmt_word">Treadeth upon the high places of the earth.</span> An anthropomorphic representation of the might and majesty of God, who governs all things, and has the loftiest in perfect subjection (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-8.htm">Job 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-3.htm">Micah 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord,</span> Jehovah, the eternal, self-existent, covenant God, is he who in these things manifests himself, and therefore his threats are not to be despised (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-8.htm">Amos 5:8</a>). In the prophet's view the laws and powers of nature have their scope in executing God's commands. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:6-13 See the folly of carnal hearts; they wander from one creature to another, seeking for something to satisfy, and labour for that which satisfies not; yet, after all, they will not incline their ear to Him in whom they might find all they can want. Preaching the gospel is as rain, and every thing withers where this rain is wanting. It were well if people were as wise for their souls as they are for their bodies; and, when they have not this rain near, would go and seek it where it is to be had. As the Israelites persisted in rebellion and idolatry, the Lord was coming against them as an adversary. Ere long, we must meet our God in judgment; but we shall not be able to stand before him, if he tries us according to our doings. If we would prepare to meet our God with comfort, at the awful period of his coming, we must now meet him in Christ Jesus, the eternal Son of the Father, who came to save lost sinners. We must seek him while he is to be found.</body></html>
