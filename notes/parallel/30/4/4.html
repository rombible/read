Gilgal.--</span>In bitterly ironical words the prophet summons Israel to the calf-worship of Bethel, and to similar rites of bastard Jehovah-worship at Gilgal. These spots were full of sacred associations. The sarcastic force of the passage is lost in E.V. For "three years" read <span class= "ital">every three days.</span> The law only required a tithe every third year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-12.htm" title="When you have made an end of tithing all the tithes of your increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and have given it to the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within your gates, and be filled;">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>); but here the prophet is lashing the people with hyperbolical irony for their excessive generosity to the base priests and spurious sanctuaries.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The prophet now turns to Israel, and ironically bids them exhibit their zeal for idolatry, and thus increase their guilt. <span class="cmt_word">Bethel</span>; as the chief seat of idol worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-14.htm">Amos 3:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">At Gilgal;</span> rather, <span class="accented">to Gilgal</span>, "come ye" being repeated in thought. Gilgal was a strong position in the plain of Jordan, three miles east of Jericho, taking its name probably from the stone circles erected for purposes of worship in very early times. Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-9.htm">Joshua 5:9</a>) gave a new meaning to the old name. There is a large pool of water in this neighbourhood called Jil-julieh, about four miles from the Jordan, which is doubtless a corruption of the ancient name Gilgal. It seems to have been regarded as a holy place in Samuel's days or even before (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-19.htm">Judges 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-16.htm">1 Samuel 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-8.htm">1 Samuel 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-14.htm">1 Samuel 11:14</a>, etc.; 1 Samuel 13:8, etc.); and later was appropriated to false worship, though we have no information as to the date of this declension. Gilgal and Bethel are associated together in idolatrous worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-5.htm">Amos 5:5</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-15.htm">Hosea 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-11.htm">Hosea 12:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Bring your sacrifices every morning.</span> They were careful to maintain the outward semblance of the regular Levitical worship, even beyond the letter of the Law in some respects, though their service was all the time idolatry. As this and the following clause are still ironical, Amos is speaking, not of the daily-prescribed sacrifice (<span class="accented">olah</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3</a>), but of the offerings (<span class="accented">zebach</span>) of individual Israelites which were not required to be presented every day. <span class="cmt_word">Your tithes after three years;</span> literally, <span class="accented">on the</span> <span class="accented">three of days</span>; <span class="accented">lishlosheth yamim</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">tribus diebus</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "every third day." Revised Version, "every three days." So Gesenius, Ewald, Keil, Schegg, Hitzig, Baur. The prophet bids them bring their tithes, not as the Law ordered, every year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30</a>), or, as in the case of the second tithe, every three years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-28.htm">Deuteronomy 14:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>), but, by an ironical exaggeration, "every three days." Dr. Pusey defends the English Version on the ground of the idiomatic use of "days" for one circle of days, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-29.htm">Leviticus 25:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-10.htm">Judges 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-7.htm">1 Samuel 27:7</a>). But this loses the irony which is so marked in the whole passage. Keil, "If ye would offer slain sacrifices every morning, and tithe every three days, ye would only thereby increase your apostasy from the living God." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-5 What is got by extortion is commonly used to provide for the flesh, and to fulfil the lusts thereof. What is got by oppression cannot be enjoyed with satisfaction. How miserable are those whose confidence in unscriptural observances only prove that they believe a lie! Let us see to it that our faith, hope, and worship, are warranted by the Divine word.</body></html>
