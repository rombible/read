Dr. Pusey enumerates a long series of earthquakes, which distressed Palestine, though not the central parts of the country, from the time of Julian to the twelfth century. The allusion to Sodom and Gomorrah gives a hint of the fierce licence and vice which had prevailed in some parts of the Northern kingdom, and called for chastisement.<p><span class= "bld">Some of you.</span>--More accurately <span class= "ital">among you.</span><p><span class= "bld">Brand plucked</span> . . .--Men would cast such a brand back into the fire. "Behold the goodness and severity of God."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - The fifth visitation is the earthquake (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I have overthrown.</span> This is the word used to describe the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-25.htm">Genesis 19:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-16.htm">Jeremiah 20:16</a>), and it seems better to refer the occurrence mentioned to some such convulsions of nature which caused widespread destruction, than, as Keil and others, "to the utter confusion of the state by which Israel was brought to the verge of ruin." We do not know anything about the particular earthquake to which the prophet alludes. (For an exhaustive catalogue of the earthquakes in this country, see Pusey's notes on this verse.) <span class="cmt_word">As God overthrew.</span> The substitution of the name of God for the personal pronoun, when the Lord himself is speaking, is not uncommon in Hebrew. Here it rather takes the form of a quotation from Genesis. <span class="cmt_word">Ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a>, where see note) - a phrase which implies, not only a narrow escape, but an escape accompanied with loss. The "brand" not wholly consumed is yet blackened and diminished by the burning (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-5.htm">2 Kings 13:5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:6-13 See the folly of carnal hearts; they wander from one creature to another, seeking for something to satisfy, and labour for that which satisfies not; yet, after all, they will not incline their ear to Him in whom they might find all they can want. Preaching the gospel is as rain, and every thing withers where this rain is wanting. It were well if people were as wise for their souls as they are for their bodies; and, when they have not this rain near, would go and seek it where it is to be had. As the Israelites persisted in rebellion and idolatry, the Lord was coming against them as an adversary. Ere long, we must meet our God in judgment; but we shall not be able to stand before him, if he tries us according to our doings. If we would prepare to meet our God with comfort, at the awful period of his coming, we must now meet him in Christ Jesus, the eternal Son of the Father, who came to save lost sinners. We must seek him while he is to be found.</body></html>
