The next clause is very obscure. It is best to take the verb as passive, <span class= "ital">Ye shall be thrown out.</span> The word that follows is rendered "the palace" by the E.V. with Kimchi and other authorities, under the assumption that the Heb. <span class= "ital">harmon</span> is another form of the word elsewhere used in Amos <span class= "ital">armon.</span> But this is mere guess-work, and yields no good sense. It would be better to adopt a slight emendation of our text, and treat the obscure word as a proper name (LXX., Targ., Syr., Vulg.). Many commentators (Michaelis, G. Baur, De Wette) follow the Targ. and Syr. and render "Ye shall be cast out to the mountains of Armenia<span class= "ital">"</span> (their place of banishment). For further information see Excursus.<p><span class= "bld">EXCURSUS A (Amos 4:3).</span><p>The rendering of the LXX., "to the mountain Remman (or Romman)," has suggested to Ewald the interpretation, <span class= "ital">And shall cast Rimmona to the mountain, i.e.</span>, in their flight (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/2-18.htm" title="And the idols he shall utterly abolish.">Isaiah 2:18-21</a>), Rimmona being the idol-goddess of love, corresponding to the masculine deity Rimmon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-18.htm" title="In this thing the LORD pardon your servant, that when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon your servant in this thing.">2Kings 5:18</a>). In this ingenious, though somewhat far-fetched, interpretation of a difficult passage, it will be observed that Ewald takes the Hebrew verb as an active, and not a passive. In this he is supported by most MSS.<p>But the credit of suggesting the most plausible explanation belongs to Hitzig, who, in his commentary, proposes to read Hadad-Rimmon, and translates, <span class= "ital">Ye shall be cast away to Hadad-Rimmon.</span> On <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-11.htm" title="In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.">Zechariah 12:11</a>, there is a long note by Steiner supporting the supposition that Hadad-Rimmon was a modified designation of the sun-god, and was likewise the counterpart of the Greek Adonis, over whose wounding and death there was an annual lamentation, in which the women took part, and gave way to all kinds of excess. Hadad-Rimmon was, therefore, the name of the deity and the locality of his worship (comp. <span class= "ital">Ashtaroth Karnaim</span> and other examples), now called <span class= "ital">Rummane,</span> four miles south of <span class= "ital">Ledsh-n</span> (Megiddo). To this spot the women were to be carried off for purposes of prostitution. (Comp. the threat pronounced by the prophet, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-17.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD; Your wife shall be an harlot in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided by line; and you shall die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.">Amos 7:17</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At the breaches</span> made in the city walls, as cattle hurry through gaps in a fence. Thus they should go forth when Samaria was taken. Every cow at that which is <span class="cmt_word">before her;</span> better, <span class="accented">each straight before her</span>, just where the opening offered itself (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5, 20</a>).

The Hebrew expression <span class="accented">haharmonah</span> occurs nowhere else. Our version takes it in the sense of <span class="accented">armon</span>, "a palace," intending probably a palace or citadel of the enemy, which certainly ought to have been expressed. Kimchi renders, "Ye shall cast yourselves into the palace of the king." The passage is probably corrupt. If the verb is taken as passive, the unusual word must be considered to denote the place of banishment. Thus, "Ye shall be cast forth into Harmon." Whether Harmon means Armenia, as many ancient commentators thought, or not, cannot be determined. Various opinions may be seen in Keil, Schegg, Trochon, and others; but the simplest explanation is that of Orelli and Ewald, viz. that each fugitive shall fling away her idol Rimmona (the wife of the god Rimmon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-18.htm">2 Kings 5:18</a>), in order to be more free for flight (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-20.htm">Isaiah 2:20</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-5 What is got by extortion is commonly used to provide for the flesh, and to fulfil the lusts thereof.
