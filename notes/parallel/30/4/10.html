Egypt is the birthplace of the plague or black death, and the circumstances augmenting its horror are here terribly portrayed. G. Baur thinks, that since the drought is mentioned after the famine as its true cause, so here the prophet explains the cause of the pestilence, or the way in which it would be brought about, viz., by the hosts of slaughtered warriors scattered over the camp.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - The fourth visitation is pestilence and the sword (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-60.htm">Deuteronomy 28:60</a>). <span class="cmt_word">After the manner of Egypt.</span> In the manner in which Egypt is stricken (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-24.htm">Isaiah 10:24, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-30.htm">Ezekiel 20:30</a>). There is here no reference to the plague of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-3.htm">Exodus 9:3</a>, etc., or Exodus 12:29. The allusion is to the plague which was reckoned to be epidemic in Egypt, and to other loathsome diseases for which that country was notorious (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-15.htm">Deuteronomy 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27, 60</a>) Sir G.

Preaching the gospel is as rain, and every thing withers where this rain is wanting. It were well if people were as wise for their souls as they are for their bodies; and, when they have not this rain near, would go and seek it where it is to be had. As the Israelites persisted in rebellion and idolatry, the Lord was coming against them as an adversary. Ere long, we must meet our God in judgment; but we shall not be able to stand before him, if he tries us according to our doings. If we would prepare to meet our God with comfort, at the awful period of his coming, we must now meet him in Christ Jesus, the eternal Son of the Father, who came to save lost sinners. We must seek him while he is to be found.</body></html>
