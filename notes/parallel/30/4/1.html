The "strong bulls of Bashan" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-12.htm" title="Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.">Psalm 22:12</a>) were descriptive of the malignant enemies of the ideal sufferer.

Some regard the feminines as sarcastic epithets, merely expressing effeminacy on the part of men. But this is not a probable explanation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-13.</span> - &sect; 2. <span class="accented">Second</span> <span class="accented">address</span>. <span class="accented">The prophet reproves the voluptuous women of Samaria, and fortells their captivity</span> (vers. 1-3); <span class="accented">with bitter irony he describes the people's devotion to idolatry</span> (vers. 4, 5): <span class="accented">he shows how incorrigible they have proved <span class="accented">themselves under God's chastisements</span> (vers. 6-11); <span class="accented">therefore they must expect further punishment, if so be that they will learn to fear the Lord</span> (vers. 12, 13). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The very women are leaders in dissoluteness and oppression. <span class="cmt_word">Ye kine of Bashan.</span> Fat and well liking, such as the rich pastures of Bashan produce. Some have supposed that by this term are meant the luxurious nobles of Samaria, who are called "cows" as being effeminate and licentious. This is possible; but such grandees would be called rather "bulls of Bashan," and the "masters" mentioned just below signify more naturally these women's husbands than the kings. Pussy notes that the genders in the sentence are interchanged. "Hear <span class="accented">ye</span>," "<span class="accented">your</span> Lord," "upon <span class="accented">you</span>," "they shall take <span class="accented">you</span>," being masculine; "<span class="accented">that</span> oppress," "<span class="accented">that</span> crush," "<span class="accented">that</span> say<span class="accented"></span>," "<span class="accented">your</span> posterity," "<span class="accented">ye</span> shall go out," "<span class="accented">each</span> before <span class="accented">her</span>," "<span class="accented">ye</span> shall cast," feminine. Evidently the prophet addresses his reproaches to the luxurious of both sexes, though he begins with the women. The land of Bashan extended from Hermon to the Jabbok, including Gaulonitis, Auronitis, Batauea, and Trachonitis. It was always famous for its pasturage, cattle, and oaks. The Vulgate takes the term as metaphorical, and has, <span class="accented">vaccae pingues.</span> So Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, which translation Jerome adopts. <span class="cmt_word">Mountain of Samaria.</span> The hill of Shomer, on which Samaria was built (see note on ch. 3:9). <span class="cmt_word">Oppress the poor.</span> This they did in ministering, or getting their husbands to minister, to their luxury and debauchery. Apparently they urged their husbands to violence and fraud in order to obtain means to satisfy their extravagance.
