The greedy mercantile class is referred to. The <span class= "ital">ephah,</span> which was a dry measure (= three English pecks), was "made small," so that a smaller quantity might be sold.

Coined money of determined value seems not to have been used before the return from Captivity, all payments of fixed amount previous to that period being made by weighing (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-16.htm">Genesis 23:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-21.htm">Genesis 43:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-6.htm">Isaiah 46:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Falsifying the balances by deceit</span>; better, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">dealing falsely with balances of deceit.</span> To increase their gains they falsified their scales or used fraudulent weights (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-36.htm">Leviticus 19:36</a>). Thus they cheated the poor probably in three ways - by small measure, exorbitant price, and light weight. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:4-10 The rich and powerful of the land were the most guilty of oppression, as well as the foremost in idolatry. They were weary of the restraints of the sabbaths and the new moons, and wished them over, because no common work might be done therein. This is the character of many who are called Christians. The sabbath day and sabbath work are a burden to carnal hearts. It will either be profaned or be accounted a dull day. But can we spend our time better than in communion with God? When employed in religious services, they were thinking of marketings. They were weary of holy duties, because their worldly business stood still the while. Those are strangers to God, and enemies to themselves, who love market days better than sabbath days, who would rather be selling corn than worshipping God. They have no regard to man: those who have lost the savour of piety, will not long keep the sense of common honesty. They cheat those they deal with. They take advantage of their neighbour's ignorance or necessity, in a traffic which nearly concerns the labouring poor. Could we witness the fraud and covetousness, which, in such numerous forms, render trading an abomination to the Lord, we should not wonder to see many dealers backward in the service of God. But he who thus despises the poor, reproaches his Maker; as it regards Him, rich and poor meet together. Riches that are got by the ruin of the poor, will bring ruin on those that get them. God will remember their sin against them. This speaks the case of such unjust, unmerciful men, to be miserable indeed, miserable for ever. There shall be terror and desolation every where. It shall come upon them when they little think of it. Thus uncertain are all our creature-comforts and enjoyments, even life itself; in the midst of life we are in death. What will be the wailing in the bitter day which follows sinful and sensual pleasures!</body></html>
