It is better rendered, "the songs of the palace," referring to the songs of the revellers mentioned already (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>). These shall be changed into <span class="cmt_word">howlings</span> of lamentation for the dead which lie around (comp. ver. 10). There shall be <span class="cmt_word">many dead bodies</span>. The Hebrew is more forcible: "Many the corpses: in every place he hath cast them forth. Hush!" The Lord is represented as casting dead bodies to the ground, so that death is everywhere; and the interjection "hush!" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-10.htm">Amos 6:10</a>) is an admonition to bend beneath the hand of an avenging God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7</a>). Orelli takes it as an expression of the apathy that accompanies severe and irremediable suffering - suffering too deep for words. The Greek and Latin versions take this onomatopoetic word has! "hush!" as a substantive. Thus the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, "I will cast upon them silence;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">projicietur silentium</span> - an expressive rendering, but one not supported by grammatical considerations. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-3 Amos saw a basket of summer fruit gathered, and ready to be eaten; which signified, that the people were ripe for destruction, that the year of God's patience was drawing towards a conclusion. Such summer fruits will not keep till winter, but must be used at once. Yet these judgments shall not draw from them any acknowledgement, either of God's righteousness or their own unrighteousness. Sinners put off repentance from day to day, because they think the Lord thus delays his judgments.</body></html>
