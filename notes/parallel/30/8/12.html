The reference to the east here has an instructive parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-6.htm" title="Therefore you have forsaken your people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.">Isaiah 2:6</a>, where the house of Jacob is enounced as being "full of the east." Probably Delitzsch is right in interpreting the east there to mean Arabia as inclusive of the whole tract from the Sinaitic peninsula to the banks of the Euphrates. The north would mean Ph?nicia and Aram. From these districts the distracted superstitious Hebrew sought vain help in idolatrous forms of divination.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall wander;</span> literally, <span class="accented">they shall reel.</span> The verse implies the eagerness of their unsatisfied desire, which seeks everywhere for the revelation which for their sin is denied them. <span class="cmt_word">From sea to sea.</span> This expression is taken, by Keil and others, to mean here "all the world over," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-12.htm">Micah 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-10.htm">Zechariah 9:10</a>; but it is probably used by the prophet in a more restricted sense, as it would not be natural for him to refer in the first place to the seeking of the words of God beyond the limits of the Holy Land. Therefore "from sea to sea" means from the Sea of Galilee or the Dead Sea to the Mediterranean; and <span class="cmt_word">from the north even to the east</span> - from the north round again to the east, the south not being mentioned, because there alone was the true worship of God to be found, and they refused to seek it there (Pusey). Of course, according to the wide scope taken by prophecy, which is not exhausted by one fulfilment, we may see here the fate of the Jews to the present time hopelessly seeking Messiah and the Word of God, never finding that which they once recklessly rejected. By some error the LXX. render, <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>., unless they mean, "They shall be tossed as waters," etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:11-14 Here was a token of God's highest displeasure. At any time, and most in a time of trouble, a famine of the word of God is the heaviest judgment. To many this is no affliction, yet some will feel it very much, and will travel far to hear a good sermon; they feel the loss of the mercies others foolishly sin away. But when God visits a backsliding church, their own plans and endeavours to find out a way of salvation, will stand them in no stead. And the most amiable and zealous would perish, for want of the water of life, which Christ only can bestow. Let us value our advantages, seek to profit by them, and fear sinning them away.</body></html>
