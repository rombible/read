Some commentators, ancient and modern, think that the actual road which led to Beersheba is here meant, and would translate, "As the way to Beersheba liveth," "By the life of the way to Beersheba," as Mohammedans swear by the pilgrimage to Mecca. But it is best to take the word rendered "manner" in the sense of "way," as <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is used in Acts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-9.htm">Acts 19:9, 23</a>) for mode of worship, or form of religion, the ritual, or use of the service there.

At any time, and most in a time of trouble, a famine of the word of God is the heaviest judgment. To many this is no affliction, yet some will feel it very much, and will travel far to hear a good sermon; they feel the loss of the mercies others foolishly sin away. But when God visits a backsliding church, their own plans and endeavours to find out a way of salvation, will stand them in no stead. And the most amiable and zealous would perish, for want of the water of life, which Christ only can bestow. Let us value our advantages, seek to profit by them, and fear sinning them away.</body></html>
