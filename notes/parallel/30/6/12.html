The conception of oppression, luxury, and pride being the forerunners of prosperity and peace is anomalous. The idea is, that that which should have insured the stability of the state, the embodiment of its conscience, had been turned into narcotic poison--the self-satisfaction of personal greed. <span class= "ital">Rosh,</span> the Hebrew for "gall," is a poisonous kind of plant with bitter taste, and resembling, according to Jerome, stalks of grass, and propagating itself with such rapidity that it is difficult to exterminate it. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-4.htm" title="They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springs up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.">Hosea 10:4</a>. <span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary</span> suggests "poppy-head.") In <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-7.htm" title="You who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,">Amos 5:7</a> the word expressed here by "hemlock" is rendered "worm-wood," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-15.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.">Jeremiah 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-15.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land.">Jeremiah 23:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-18.htm" title="Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood;">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>, &c., a rendering which should have been retained here. Gall and worm-wood are constantly associated in Old Testament prophecy in this metaphorical sense.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-14.</span> - The prophet shows the folly of these evil doers who think in their own strength to defy judgment and to resist the enemy whom God is sending against them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall horses run upon the rock?</span> Can horses gallop safely over places covered with rocks and stones? <span class="cmt_word">Will one plough there with oxen?</span> Do men plough the rock with their oxen? The answer, of course, is "No." Yet your conduct is equally foolish, your labour is equally lost. Some, dividing the words differently, translate, "Does one plough the sea with oxen?" which reminds one of the Latin proverb, "Litus arare bubus." Thus Ovid, 'Ep. Heroid,' 5:115 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Quid facis OEnone? Quid arenae semina mandas?<br />Non protecturis litora bubus aras."</span> <span class="cmt_word">For ye have turned;</span> or, <span class="accented">that ye have turned. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Judgment into gall</span> (see note on Amos 5:7). <span class="cmt_word">Hemlock</span>. Some plant with an acrid juice. Ye turn the administration of justice, which is "the fruit of righteousness," into the bitterest injustice and wrong. It were "more easy," says Pusey, "to change the course of nature or the use of things of nature, than the course of God's providence or the laws of his just retribution." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:8-14 How dreadful, how miserable, is the case of those whose eternal ruin the Lord himself has sworn; for he can execute his purpose, and none can alter it! Those hearts are wretchedly hardened that will not be brought to mention God's name, and to worship him, when the hand of God is gone out against them, when sickness and death are in their families. Those that will not be tilled as fields, shall be abandoned as rocks. When our services of God are soured with sin, his providences will justly be made bitter to us. Men should take warning not to harden their hearts, for those who walk in pride, God will destroy.</body></html>
