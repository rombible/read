(Comp. the formula of Divine asseveration: "As I live, saith the Lord," which derives illustration from the custom of swearing by the life of a monarch; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/42-15.htm" title="Hereby you shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh you shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come here.">Genesis 42:15-16</a>.) With the eternal unchangeable being of the Supreme Monarch stands contrasted "the excellency of Jacob," the false futile glory which Jehovah abhors. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-7.htm" title="The LORD has sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.">Amos 8:7</a> the phrase is used for God Himself; not, however, in either passage God's absolute perfection or objective glory, but the thoughts, sometimes wise, sometimes base, which men have entertained about Him. From the context we infer that the splendid shrine of Samaria, with its unacceptable offerings and calf-worship, is here meant. The reference to the coming destruction of buildings great and small (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-11.htm" title="For, behold, the LORD commands, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.">Amos 6:11</a>) lends colour to this interpretation.

Those hearts are wretchedly hardened that will not be brought to mention God's name, and to worship him, when the hand of God is gone out against them, when sickness and death are in their families. Those that will not be tilled as fields, shall be abandoned as rocks. When our services of God are soured with sin, his providences will justly be made bitter to us. Men should take warning not to harden their hearts, for those who walk in pride, God will destroy.</body></html>
