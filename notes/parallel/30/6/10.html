This is the same person as the kinsman. the butler; but tot some reason, either from the number of deaths, or from the pestilence, or from the distance of the burying place, which would be out of the city and inaccessible in the blockade, he cannot lay the body in the brave, and is forced to take and burn it. Though the Jews generally buried dead bodies, cremation was sometimes used, both in honour or emergency (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-12.htm">1 Samuel 31:12</a>) and in punishment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-14.htm">Leviticus 20:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-9.htm">Leviticus 21:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The bones;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the corpse, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-19.htm">Exodus 13:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-21.htm">2 Kings 13:21</a>; Keil.

This is the last living person, who had hidden himself in the most remote chambers; or it may be a messenger whom the kinsman had sent to search the house. He asks him - Is there yet any with thee? Is there any one left alive to succour, or dead to bury? <span class="cmt_word">And he shall say, No;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">et respondebit, Finis est. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Then he</span> (the kinsman) <span class="cmt_word">shall say, Hold thy tongue</span> (<span class="accented">Has!</span>); <span class="accented">Hush!</span> He stays the man in the inner chamber from speaking; and why? <span class="cmt_word">For we may not make mention of the name of the Lord;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">et non</span> <span class="accented">recorderis nominis Domini.</span> Some, as Pussy, Schegg, and Gandell, see here the voice of despair. It is too late to call upon God now; it is the time of vengeance. We rejected him in life; we may not cry to him in death. St. Jerome refers the prohibition to the hardness of heart and unbelief of the people, who even in all this misery will not confess the name of the Lord. Keil says, "It indicates a fear lest, by the invocation of the name of God, his eye should be drawn towards this last remaining one, and he also should fall a victim to the judgment of death." Others again think that the notion in the mind of the impious speaker is that Jehovah is the Author of all their calamities, and that he is impatient at the very mention of his name. The simplest explanation is the first, or a modification of it The person addressed is about to pray or to call on God in his distress. "Be silent," says the speaker; "we can no longer appeal to Jehovah as the covenant God; by naming him we call to his remembrance how we have broken the covenant, violated our relation to him; therefore provoke him not further by making mention of his name." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:8-14 How dreadful, how miserable, is the case of those whose eternal ruin the Lord himself has sworn; for he can execute his purpose, and none can alter it! Those hearts are wretchedly hardened that will not be brought to mention God's name, and to worship him, when the hand of God is gone out against them, when sickness and death are in their families. Those that will not be tilled as fields, shall be abandoned as rocks. When our services of God are soured with sin, his providences will justly be made bitter to us. Men should take warning not to harden their hearts, for those who walk in pride, God will destroy.</body></html>
