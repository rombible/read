These are now summoned to listen to the rebuke of the Divine Judge.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - With a second woe the prophet denounces the chiefs of the whole nation, who were quite satisfied with the present state of things, and, revelling in luxury, feared no coming judgment. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Them that are at ease in Zion;</span> living in fancied security and self-pleasing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-9.htm">Isaiah 32:9, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-12.htm">Zephaniah 1:12</a>). Judah is included in the denunciation, because she is equally guilty; the whole covenant nation is sunk in the same dangerous apathy. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, "them that set at naught Zion." The same rendering is found in the Syriac, and can be supported by a small change in the Hebrew. It may have been intended thus to confine the announcement to Israel alone, in conformity with the prophet's chief scope. But he has introduced mention of Judah elsewhere, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-4.htm">Amos 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>, and his sense of his own people's careless ease may well lead him to include them in his warning<span class="cmt_word">. Trust in the mountain of Samaria.</span> The city was deemed impregnable, and it kept the Assyrians at bay for three years before it was finally taken (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-9.htm">2 Kings 18:9</a>, etc.; see notes on Amos 3:9 and Amos 4:1). Another rendering, not so suitable, is, <span class="accented">the careless ones upon the mountain of Samaria.</span> The point, however, is the supposed impregnability of the city which occasioned a feeling of perfect security. Which are <span class="cmt_word">named chief of the nations;</span> rather, <span class="accented">to the</span> <span class="accented">notable men of the chief of nations</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the principal men of Israel, which had the proud title of the chief of the nations because it was beloved and elected of God, and was designed to keep alive true religion, and to set an example to the rest of the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-17.htm">Numbers 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-23.htm">2 Samuel 7:23</a>). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "they plucked the chiefs of the nations," where the verb is a mistaken Tendering. <span class="cmt_word">To whom the house of Israel came;</span> or, <span class="accented">come</span>. Resort for counsel and judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-4.htm">2 Samuel 15:4</a>), and who ought therefore to be patterns of righteousness and equity. The rendering of the Vulgate, <span class="accented">ingredientes pompatice domum Israel</span>, "entering with pomp into the house of Israel" (which does not agree with the present Hebrew text), implies that these chieftains carried themselves haughtily in the congregation of Israel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-7 Those are looked upon as doing well for themselves, who do well for their bodies; but we are here told what their ease is, and what their woe is. Here is a description of the pride, security, and sensuality, for which God would reckon. Careless sinners are every where in danger; but those at ease in Zion, who are stupid, vainly confident, and abusing their privileges, are in the greatest danger. Yet many fancy themselves the people of God, who are living in sin, and in conformity to the world. But the examples of others' ruin forbid us to be secure. Those who are set upon their pleasures are commonly careless of the troubles of others, but this is great offence to God. Those who placed their happiness in the pleasures of sense, and set their hearts upon them, shall be deprived of those pleasures. Those who try to put the evil day far from them, find it nearest to them.</body></html>
