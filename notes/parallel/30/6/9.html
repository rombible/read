Nine have fallen victims. Fathers and brothers are all gone, and the uncle comes in as the funereal burner, to carry out the corpse to the pyre, and finds in the innermost parts of the house the tenth victim of the fell disease yet alive. A hurried word or two passes between them: "Is there yet another with thee?" and the answer comes, "Not one." Then shall he say "Hush!" The lonely sufferer begins to curse the Lord for His judgments, or it may be he begins to call upon the Name of the Lord when it is too late, when, as a finishing touch of darkest gloom and despair, he is interrupted by a warning not to stir up Jehovah's wrath in this day of His visitation by even mentioning His name.

And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.">2Chronicles 21:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-5.htm" title="But you shall die in peace: and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings which were before you, so shall they burn odors for you; and they will lament you, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 34:5</a>, are to honorific burning of spices in memory of the dead.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If there remain ten men in one house.</span> If these escape death in war, they shall die of famine and pestilence in the three years' siege of Samaria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5</a>).

Those that will not be tilled as fields, shall be abandoned as rocks. When our services of God are soured with sin, his providences will justly be made bitter to us. Men should take warning not to harden their hearts, for those who walk in pride, God will destroy.</body></html>
