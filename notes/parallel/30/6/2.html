Kalneh, the Kalno of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-9.htm" title="Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus?">Isaiah 10:9</a>, the Assyrian <span class= "ital">Kulunu</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-10.htm" title="And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.">Genesis 10:10</a>), is here probably mentioned first because it is most easterly. It is identified by Kiepert with <span class= "ital">Holwan,</span> but its position is uncertain, though generally regarded as lying in the neighbourhood of the Greek Ctesiphon, on the Tigris. Hamath is the ancient Hittite city in the valley of the Orontes, and it had felt the strong hand of Jeroboam II. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-28.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?">2Kings 14:28</a>). We have no reason for believing that at this period the Assyrian power had destroyed the importance of these places, though the prophet may have regarded that issue as imminent. Hamath the Great (or Rabba; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-8.htm" title="And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them to great Zidon, and to Misrephothmaim, and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.">Joshua 11:8</a>), according to the inscriptions, sustained defeats from Salmanassar II. about 850 B.C. It was finally overthrown by Sargon in 720 B.C., who in his own boastful language "swept over its land like a flood." Gath, the home of Goliath, had probably lost its original importance. Uzziah destroyed it. Were Calno, Hamath, Gath, more important than Zion or Samaria? Then, says the prophet, do not expect in your opulence and self-satisfaction immunity from a worse doom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pass ye.</span> Go and compare your condition with that of other countries, from the furthest east to the north, to your own neighbours - has not God done more for you than for them? Nothing is said about the destruction of the three capitals, nor is Samaria threatened with similar ruin. Rather the cities are contemplated as still flourishing and prosperous (though by this time they had suffered at their enemies' hands), and Israel is bidden to remember that she is more favoured than they. <span class="cmt_word">Calneh</span>, one of the five great Babylonian cities, is probably the <span class="accented">Kul-unu</span> of the inscriptions, a town in Southern Babylonia, whose site is unknown. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a> the LXX. call it <span class="accented">Chalanne</span> or <span class="accented">Chalane</span>; in the present passage they mistake the Hebrew, and render, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, "pass ye all by" (see Schrader, 'Die Keilinschriften,' p. 442). St. Jerome identifies it with Ctesiphon, on the east bank of the Tigris. Others (see Rawlinson, 'Herodotus,' 1, p. 490, 2nd edit.) find in it Nopher or Nipur, the modern <span class="accented">Niffer</span>, some sixty miles southeast of Babylon. As one of the oldest cities in the world, ranking with Babel, Erech, and Aecad, it was well known to the Israelites. <span class="cmt_word">Hamath the great;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;</span>. This was the principal city of Upper Syria, and a place of great importance. In after years it was called Epiphania, after Antiochus Epiphanes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>). It fell in Sargon's reign, <span class="date">B.C. 720</span>; afterwards it lost its independence, and was incorporated in the Assyrian empire. <span class="cmt_word">Oath of the Philistines</span>. One of their five chief cities, and at one time the principal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-1.htm">1 Chronicles 18:1</a>). The site is placed by Porter at <span class="accented">Tell-es-Safi</span>, an isolated hill; standing above the bread valley of Elah, and "presenting on the north and west a white precipice of many hundred feet." Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' p. 215, etc.) considers Gath to be the same city as Betogabra, Eleutheropolis, and the modern <span class="accented">Beth Jibrin</span>, which is some few miles south of <span class="accented">Tell Safi</span>. He thinks the site of Tell Sift is not adapted for the seat of a large city, and he saw few indications of ancient ruins there; whereas Beit Jibrin has in and around it the most wonderful remains of antiquity to be found in all Philistia. It had probably declined in importance at this time (see note on ch. 1:6), but its old reputation was still remembered. It was taken by Uzziah, but seems not to have remained long in his possession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>). In the year <span class="date">B.C. 711</span> Sargon reduced Ashdod and Garb, which he calls Gimtu Asdudim, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Gath of the Ashdodites. <span class="cmt_word">Be they better?</span> Have they received more earthly prosperity at God's hands than you? Is their territory greater than yours? No. How ungrateful, then, are you for all my favours (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5-11</a>)! Schrader and Bickell regard the verse as an interpolation, grammatically, metrically, and chronologically inadmissible; but their arguments are not strong, and Ames makes no mention of the fate of these cities. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-7 Those are looked upon as doing well for themselves, who do well for their bodies; but we are here told what their ease is, and what their woe is. Here is a description of the pride, security, and sensuality, for which God would reckon. Careless sinners are every where in danger; but those at ease in Zion, who are stupid, vainly confident, and abusing their privileges, are in the greatest danger. Yet many fancy themselves the people of God, who are living in sin, and in conformity to the world. But the examples of others' ruin forbid us to be secure. Those who are set upon their pleasures are commonly careless of the troubles of others, but this is great offence to God. Those who placed their happiness in the pleasures of sense, and set their hearts upon them, shall be deprived of those pleasures. Those who try to put the evil day far from them, find it nearest to them.</body></html>
