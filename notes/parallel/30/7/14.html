Prophecy, like other occupations, tended to form a hereditary guild, but Amos was not by birth a prophet. The word for "gatherer" is rendered in the LXX. and Vulg. "nipper," or "pincher." There was a custom mentioned in Theophrastus, <span class= "ital">Hist. Plant.,</span> iv. 2, Pliny, <span class= "ital">Hist.

The exercise of the prophetical office was restricted neither to sex nor rank. There were many prophetesses in Israel, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Deborah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4.htm">Judges 4</a>.), Huldah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-14.htm">2 Kings 22:14</a>), Noadiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-14.htm">Nehemiah 6:14</a>); and besides a large number of nameless prophets there are twenty-three whose names are preserved in Holy Writ, omitting those whose writings have come down to us (Ladd, 'Doctrine of Scripture,' 1:117, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">A prophet's son;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> brought up in the schools of the prophets, the pupils of which were called "sons of the prophets" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-35.htm">1 Kings 20:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-5.htm">2 Kings 2:5</a>).

The latter is probably the meaning of the term here. The Septuagint rendering, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, "pricking sycamore fruit," and that of the Vulgate, <span class="accented">vellicans sycomoros</span>, indicate the artificial means for ripening the fruit, which was done by scraping, scratching, or puncturing it, as is sometimes done to the figs of commerce. As the tree bore many crops of fruit in the year, it would afford constant employment to the dresser (see 'Dict. of the Bible,' 3. p. 1394; 'Bible Educator,' 4, p. 343). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:10-17 It is no new thing for the accusers of the brethren, to misrepresent them as enemies to the king and kingdom, as traitors to their prince, and troublers of the land, when they are the best friends to both. Those who make gain their godliness, and are governed by the hopes of wealth and preferment, are ready to think these the most powerful motives with others also. But those who have a warrant from God, like Amos, ought not to fear the face of man. If God, that sent him, had not strengthened him, he could not thus have set his face as a flint. The Lord often chooses the weak and foolish things of the world to confound the wise and mighty. But no fervent prayers, or self-denying labours, can bring proud sinners to bear faithful reproofs and warnings. And all who oppose or despise the Divine word, must expect fatal effects to their souls, unless they repent.</body></html>
