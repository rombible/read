For "a portion" read <span class= "ital">the portion.</span> The image is that of a prairie fire, that should eat up the later grass spared by the locusts. The consuming of the "great deep" is a strong hyperbole, and can scarcely refer to the "heathen world," as Keil maintains. The meaning rather appears to be that not only the solitary remnant of pasture, but the deepest springs of moisture, will be scorched up in the blaze. The same word for "deep" (<span class= "ital">tehom</span>) is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/1-2.htm" title="And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep.

Rather, the portion (not a part) is that part of the land and people which was marked out for judgment. The particular calamity alluded to is the second invasion of Tigiath-Pileser II, when he conquered Gilead and the northern part of the kingdom, and carried some of the people captive to Assyria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-9 God bears long, but he will not bear always with a provoking people. The remembrance of the mercies we formerly received, like the produce of the earth of the former growth, should make us submissive to the will of God, when we meet with disappointments in the latter growth. The Lord has many ways of humbling a sinful nation. Whatever trouble we are under, we should be most earnest with God for the forgiveness of sin. Sin will soon make a great people small. What will become of Israel, if the hand that should raise him be stretched out against him? See the power of prayer. See what a blessing praying people are to a land. See how ready, how swift God is to show mercy; how he waits to be gracious. Israel was a wall, a strong wall, which God himself reared as a defence to his sanctuary. The Lord now seems to stand upon this wall. He measures it; it appears to be a bowing, bulging wall. Thus God would bring the people of Israel to the trial, would discover their wickedness; and the time will come, when those who have been spared often, shall be spared no longer. But the Lord still calls Israel his people. The repeated prayer and success of the prophet should lead us to seek the Saviour.</body></html>
