And so the priest of Bethel takes upon himself to dismiss the prophet from the kingdom. The word for "seer" is here <span class= "ital">chozeh,</span> one who has visions, a word not used in a contemptuous sense here or in the Old Testament generally. The expression "there eat bread and prophecy" is a <span class= "ital">hendiadys</span> for "there live on your profession as a prophet," not here. To this Amos replies that that was not his profession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-14.htm" title="Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdsman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:">Amos 7:14</a>). Bethel is spoken of as the "holy place," or sanctuary, and also as the "royal residence" (E.V., "king's court"). Men blinded by prejudice, and bewildered by the light of our Lord's holy presence, besought him to depart from them. The awful peril of imploring God's messenger to withdraw is frequently referred to in Scripture. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/10-10.htm" title="But into whatever city you enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,">Luke 10:10-12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also Amaziah said</span>. Jeroboam appears to have taken no steps in consequence of this accusation, either deeming that the words of a visionary were unworthy of serious consideration, or, like Herod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-5.htm">Matthew 14:5</a>), fearing the people, who had been impressed by the prophet's words and bold bearing. Therefore Amaziah endeavours by his own authority to make Amos leave the country, or else does not wait for the command of the king, who was probably at Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">O thou seer!</span> Amaaiah calls Amos <span class="accented">chozeh</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-9.htm">1 Chronicles 21:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-5.htm">1 Chronicles 25:5</a>), either with reference to the visions just given, or in derision of his claims - as we might say, "visionary." <span class="cmt_word">Flee thee away;</span> fly for thine own good to escape punishment, patronizing and counselling him. <span class="cmt_word">Go to the land of Judah;</span> where doubtless your announcement of the ruin of the rival kingdom will be acceptable. <span class="cmt_word">Eat bread.</span> Amaziah speaks, as if Amos was paid for his prophecies, made a gain of godliness. <span class="cmt_word">Prophesy there.</span> "Vaticinare in terra Jude, ubi libenter audiuntur insani" (St. Jerome). The idoloatrous priest has no conception of the inspiration under which the prophet speaks. He judges others by himself, attributing to Amos the sordid motives by which he himself was influenced. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:10-17 It is no new thing for the accusers of the brethren, to misrepresent them as enemies to the king and kingdom, as traitors to their prince, and troublers of the land, when they are the best friends to both. Those who make gain their godliness, and are governed by the hopes of wealth and preferment, are ready to think these the most powerful motives with others also. But those who have a warrant from God, like Amos, ought not to fear the face of man. If God, that sent him, had not strengthened him, he could not thus have set his face as a flint. The Lord often chooses the weak and foolish things of the world to confound the wise and mighty. But no fervent prayers, or self-denying labours, can bring proud sinners to bear faithful reproofs and warnings. And all who oppose or despise the Divine word, must expect fatal effects to their souls, unless they repent.</body></html>
