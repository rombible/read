The punishment was conditioned by man's behaviour or other considerations. Here the prophet's intercession abates the full infliction of the penalty (compare analogous expressions, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-11.htm">1 Samuel 15:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-8.htm">Jeremiah 18:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-10.htm">Jeremiah 42:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a>, where see note).

The LXX. here and in ver. 6 has <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "Repent, O Lord, for this; and this shall not be, saith the Lord." Hence some early commentators gathered that the prophet's intercession was rejected; but the words do not necessarily bear that sense (see St. Cyril Alex. and Theodoret, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). <span class="cmt_word">It shall not be.</span> This respite refers to the retreat of the Assyrians under Pul, the usurping monarch who assumed the name of Tiglath-Pileser II. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-17.htm">2 Kings 15:17</a>, etc.). Some commentators consider the judgment to be literally plague of locusts; but this is not probable. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-9 God bears long, but he will not bear always with a provoking people. The remembrance of the mercies we formerly received, like the produce of the earth of the former growth, should make us submissive to the will of God, when we meet with disappointments in the latter growth. The Lord has many ways of humbling a sinful nation. Whatever trouble we are under, we should be most earnest with God for the forgiveness of sin. Sin will soon make a great people small. What will become of Israel, if the hand that should raise him be stretched out against him? See the power of prayer. See what a blessing praying people are to a land. See how ready, how swift God is to show mercy; how he waits to be gracious. Israel was a wall, a strong wall, which God himself reared as a defence to his sanctuary. The Lord now seems to stand upon this wall. He measures it; it appears to be a bowing, bulging wall. Thus God would bring the people of Israel to the trial, would discover their wickedness; and the time will come, when those who have been spared often, shall be spared no longer. But the Lord still calls Israel his people. The repeated prayer and success of the prophet should lead us to seek the Saviour.</body></html>
