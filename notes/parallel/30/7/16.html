The idea, though not the term, is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-2.htm">Deuteronomy 32:2</a>. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span>, "raise no tumult," which rather expresses Amaziah's fear of the effect of the utterance than translates the word. St. Jerome's explanation is somewhat too subtle, "<span class="accented">Stillare prophetas idioma Scripturarum est, quod non totam Dei simul inferant iram, sed parvas stillas comminatione denuntient."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:10-17 It is no new thing for the accusers of the brethren, to misrepresent them as enemies to the king and kingdom, as traitors to their prince, and troublers of the land, when they are the best friends to both. Those who make gain their godliness, and are governed by the hopes of wealth and preferment, are ready to think these the most powerful motives with others also. But those who have a warrant from God, like Amos, ought not to fear the face of man. If God, that sent him, had not strengthened him, he could not thus have set his face as a flint. The Lord often chooses the weak and foolish things of the world to confound the wise and mighty. But no fervent prayers, or self-denying labours, can bring proud sinners to bear faithful reproofs and warnings. And all who oppose or despise the Divine word, must expect fatal effects to their souls, unless they repent.</body></html>
