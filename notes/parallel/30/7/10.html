It shows that the effect of the preaching of the Judaean prophet had been felt in the sanctuary at Bethel and the palaces at Samaria. The chief priest of the Temple, with the characteristic exaggeration of fear and anger, accuses Amos of treason against the house of Jeroboam.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-17.</span> - &sect; 4. <span class="accented">This bold prophecy, no longer conceived in general terms or referring to distant times, but distinct and personal, arouses the animosity of the priestly authorities at Bethel, who accuse Amos before the king, and warn him to leave the country without more words, or to fear the worst.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Amaziah the priest of Bethel.</span> Amaziah ("the Lord is strong"), the chief of the idol priests at Bethel, a crafty and determined man, hearing this prophecy against the royal house, takes it up as a political matter, and makes a formal accusation against Amos with the view of silencing him. <span class="cmt_word">Hath conspired against thee.</span> Probably some of the Israelites had been convinced by the prophet's words, and had joined themselves to him; hence Amaziah speaks of "a conspiracy" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-8.htm">1 Samuel 22:8, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-27.htm">1 Kings 15:27</a>) against the king. Or very possibly the story was fabricated in order to accentuate the charge against Amos. <span class="cmt_word">In the midst of the house of Israel.</span> In the very centre of the kingdom, where his treasonable speeches would have the greatest effect. The land, personified, cannot endure such language, which is calculated to disturb its peace, and is quite contrary to its ideas and hopes. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:10-17 It is no new thing for the accusers of the brethren, to misrepresent them as enemies to the king and kingdom, as traitors to their prince, and troublers of the land, when they are the best friends to both. Those who make gain their godliness, and are governed by the hopes of wealth and preferment, are ready to think these the most powerful motives with others also. But those who have a warrant from God, like Amos, ought not to fear the face of man. If God, that sent him, had not strengthened him, he could not thus have set his face as a flint. The Lord often chooses the weak and foolish things of the world to confound the wise and mighty. But no fervent prayers, or self-denying labours, can bring proud sinners to bear faithful reproofs and warnings. And all who oppose or despise the Divine word, must expect fatal effects to their souls, unless they repent.</body></html>
