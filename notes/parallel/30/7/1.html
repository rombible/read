For "grasshopper," read <span class= "ital">locusts.</span> The phrase "king's mowings" suggests that the king claimed tyrannically the first-fruits of the hay harvest, which was ordinarily followed by the early "rain upon the mown grass." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-5.htm" title="And Ahab said to Obadiah, Go into the land, to all fountains of water, and to all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.">1Kings 18:5</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1-ch. 9:10.</span> - Part III. FIVE VISIONS, WITH EXPLANATIONS, CONTINUING AND CONFIRMING THE PREVIOUS PROPHECY. The afflictions are climactic, increasing in intensity. The first two symbolize judgments which have been averted by the prophet's intercession; the third and fourth adumbrate judgments which are to fall inevitably; and the fifth proclaims the overthrow of the temple and the old theocracy. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - &sect; 1. <span class="accented">The first vision, of locusts, represents Israel as a field eaten down to the ground, but shooting up afresh, and its utter destruction postponed at the prophet's prayer.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus hath the Lord God showed unto me.</span> By an inward illumination (comp. vers. 4, 7; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-1.htm">Amos 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1-3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He formed grasshoppers;</span> rather, <span class="accented">locusts</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-17.htm">Nahum 3:17</a>). This points to the moral government of God, who uses nature to work his purposes, "wind and storm fulfilling his word." <span class="cmt_word">In the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth;</span> when the aftermath was beginning to grow under the influence of the latter rains. If the herbage was destroyed then, there would be no hope of recovery in the rest of the year. <span class="cmt_word">After the king's mowings.</span> It is deduced from this expression that the first crop on certain grounds was taken for the king's use - a kind of royal perquisite, though there is no trace of such a custom found in Scripture, the passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-5.htm">1 Kings 18:5</a>, where Ahab sends Obadiah to search for pasture, having plainly nothing to do with it; and in this case, as Keil remarks, the plague would seem to fall upon the people only, and the guilty king would have escaped. But to interpret the expression entirely in a spiritual sense, with no substantial basis, as "Jehovah's judgments," destroys the harmony of the vision, ignoring its material aspect altogether. It is quite possible that the custom above mentioned did exist, though it was probably limited to certain lands, and did not apply to the whole pasturage of the country. It is here mentioned to define the time of the plague of locusts - the time, in fact, when its ravages would be most irremediable. The LXX., by a little change of letters, render, <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x393;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, by which they imply that the locusts would be as innumerable as the army of Gog. The whole version is, "Behold, a swarm of locusts coming from the East; and behold, one caterpillar, King Gog." The vision is thought to refer to the first invasion by the Assyrians, when Pul was bribed by Menahem to withdraw. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-9 God bears long, but he will not bear always with a provoking people. The remembrance of the mercies we formerly received, like the produce of the earth of the former growth, should make us submissive to the will of God, when we meet with disappointments in the latter growth. The Lord has many ways of humbling a sinful nation. Whatever trouble we are under, we should be most earnest with God for the forgiveness of sin. Sin will soon make a great people small. What will become of Israel, if the hand that should raise him be stretched out against him? See the power of prayer. See what a blessing praying people are to a land. See how ready, how swift God is to show mercy; how he waits to be gracious. Israel was a wall, a strong wall, which God himself reared as a defence to his sanctuary. The Lord now seems to stand upon this wall. He measures it; it appears to be a bowing, bulging wall. Thus God would bring the people of Israel to the trial, would discover their wickedness; and the time will come, when those who have been spared often, shall be spared no longer. But the Lord still calls Israel his people. The repeated prayer and success of the prophet should lead us to seek the Saviour.</body></html>
