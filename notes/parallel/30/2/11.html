The prophets of Israel were numerous, and renowned, and exposed to frequent persecution, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> the cases of Micaiah, Elijah, and others. "The Nazarite vow to abstain from wine, which, in the earliest case, that of Samson, appears a life-long vow, was undoubtedly a religious protest against Canaanite civilisation in favour of the simple life of ancient times." (W. R. Smith, <span class= "ital">Prophets of Israel,</span> p. 84.) The Nazarite was, moreover, a link between the prophet and the priest, upon whom, without hereditary rank or sacerdotal rite, great privileges were bestowed. The assault upon both is highly characteristic of the disloyalty of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - Having mentioned two temporal benefits conferred on Israel, the prophet now names two spiritual favours - the presence of holy speakers and holy doers. <span class="cmt_word">I raised up.</span> The prophet and the Nazarite were alike miracles of grace. The former gave heavenly teaching, the latter exhibited holiness of life. It was the Lord who gave the prophet power and authority to proclaim his will; it was the Lord who inspired the vow of the Nazarite and enabled him to carry it out in practice. <span class="cmt_word">Prophets</span>. To Israel belonged Samuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>), Ahijah of Shiloh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-2.htm">1 Kings 14:2, 4</a>), Jehu, son of Hanani (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-7.htm">1 Kings 16:7</a>), Elijah and Elisha, Hosea and Jonah. <span class="cmt_word">Young men.</span> In the height of their passions, lusty and strong. <span class="cmt_word">Nazarites</span>. The law concerning the Nazarites is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6</a>. The special restrictions by which they bound themselves (viz. abstention from strong drink, from the use of the razor, and from all ritual defilement) were the outward signs of inward purity and devotion to God. Their very name implied separation from the world and devotion to God. They were, in fact, the religious of the old Law, analogous to the monks of Christian times. The vow was either temporary or lifelong. Of perpetual Nazarites we have as instances Samson, Samuel, and John the Baptist. <span class="cmt_word">Is it not even thus?</span> Is not the existence of prophets and Nazarites among you a proof that you are signally favoured by God, separate from other nations, and bound to be a holy people?

They had helps for their souls, which taught them how to make good use of their earthly enjoyments, and were therefore more valuable. Faithful ministers are great blessings to any people; but it is God that raises them up to be so. Sinners' own consciences will witness that he has not been wanting to them in the means of grace. They did what they could to lead believers aside. Satan and his agents are busy to corrupt the minds of young people who look heavenward; they overcome many by drawing them to the love of mirth and pleasure, and into drinking company. Multitudes of young men who bade fair as professors of religion, have erred through strong drink, and have been undone for ever. The Lord complains of sin, especially the sins of his professing people, as a burden to him. And though his long-suffering be tired, his power is not, and so the sinner will find to his cost. When men reject God's word, adding obstinacy to sin, and this becomes the general character of a people, they will be given up to misery, notwithstanding all their boasted power and resources. May we then humble ourselves before the Lord, for all our ingratitude and unfaithfulness.</body></html>
