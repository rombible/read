The meek are defrauded as being too weak to claim their own. The latter part of the verse points to the sensuality of the popular worship, the word "maid" being really the prostitute (Heb. <span class= "ital">k'd?shah</span>) who was devoted to the lustful ritual of Ashera.<span class= "note">[17]</span> This obsccnity is regarded by the prophet as part of a deliberate act of desecration to the name of the Holy One of Israel. Moreover, the relation of "father" and "son" was thereby sullied and degraded. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-8.htm" title="The nakedness of your father's wife shall you not uncover: it is your father's nakedness.">Leviticus 18:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-15.htm" title="You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter in law: she is your son's wife; you shall not uncover her nakedness.">Leviticus 18:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-11.htm" title="And the man that lies with his father's wife has uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be on them.">Leviticus 20:11</a>.)<p><span class= "note">[17] Kuenen, <span class= "ital">Religion of Israel,</span> vol. 1, pp. 92, 93.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor.</span> This is the second charge - oppression of the poor. The obscure expression in the text is capable of two explanations. Hitzig, Pusey, Trochon, assume that its meaning is that in their avarice and cupidity the usurers or tyrannous rich men grudge even the dust which the poor man strews upon his head in token of his sorrow at being brought to so low a state. But this seems unnatural and farfetched, and scarcely in harmony with the simple style of Amos. The other explanation, supported by Kimchi, Sehegg, Keil, and Knabenbauer, is preferable. These oppressors desire eagerly to see the poor crushed to the earth, or so miserable as to scatter dust on their heads (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-12.htm">1 Samuel 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a>). <span class="accented">The poor</span> (<span class="accented">dal</span>, not the same word as in ver. 6); <span class="accented">depressed</span>, as brought low in condition. The Septuagint joins this with the previous clause, "And the poor for sandals, the things that tread on the dust of the earth, and smote on the heads of the needy." The Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">Qui conterunt super pulverem terrae capita pauperum</span>, "Who bruise the heads of the poor on the dust of the earth." <span class="cmt_word">Turn aside the way of the meek.</span> They thwart and hinder their path of life, and force them into crooked and evil ways. Or <span class="accented">way</span>, according to Kimchi, may mean "judicial process," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-23.htm">Proverbs 17:23</a>. This gives, to the clause much the same meaning as ver. 6. <span class="accented">The meek</span> are those who are lowly and unassuming (see note on Zephaniah 2:3). <span class="cmt_word">And a man</span> <span class="cmt_word">and his father will go in unto the same maid;</span> LXX., <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>. The Vulgate, which omits "the same," is closer to the Hebrew, <span class="accented">Et filius ac pater ejus ierunt ad puellam</span>, though the Greek doubtless gives the intended meaning. This sin, which was tantamount to incest, was virtually forbidden (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-8.htm">Leviticus 18:8, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-11.htm">Leviticus 20:11</a>). Some (as Ewald, Maurer, Gandell) see here an allusion to the organized prostitution in idol temples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-14.htm">Hosea 4:14</a>), but this seems unnecessary. <span class="cmt_word">To profane my holy Name</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-32.htm">Leviticus 22:32</a>). Such crimes dishonoured the God who called them his people, so that to them could be applied what St. Paul says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-24.htm">Romans 2:24</a>), "The Name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-3.htm">Leviticus 20:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20, 23</a>). The word <span class="accented">lemaan</span>, "in order that," implies that they committed these sins, not through ignorance, but intentionally, to bring discredit upon the true faith and worship. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 The evil passions of the heart break out in various forms; but the Lord looks to our motives, as well as our conduct. Those that deal cruelly, shall be cruelly dealt with. Other nations were reckoned with for injuries done to men; Judah is reckoned with for dishonour done to God. Judah despised the law of the Lord; and he justly gave them up to strong delusion; nor was it any excuse for their sin, that they were the lies, the idols, after which their fathers walked. The worst abominations and most grievous oppressions have been committed by some of the professed worshippers of the Lord. Such conduct leads many to unbelief and vile idolatry.</body></html>
