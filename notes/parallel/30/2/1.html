Isaiah 15, 16, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/25-10.htm" title="For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.">Isaiah 25:10-12</a>, and Jeremiah 48 Translate "burned to lime the bones of the king of Edom." The historical reference is obscure. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/3-26.htm" title="And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even to the king of Edom: but they could not.">2Kings 3:26-27</a>.) Whether Moab was guilty of desecrating royal tombs, or offering the heir of the king of Edom in sacrifice, cannot be determined. When Moab took revenge upon Edom, the latter was subject to Jehoram.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - Judgment on Moab. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moab</span>. The prophet now denounces the other nation connected by ties of blood with Israel (see on Amos 1:13). Moab's hostility had been shown in the hiring of Balsam to curse the Israelites, and in seducing them to idolatry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22-25:3</a>). He was their oppressor in the time of the Judges (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12</a>); and David had to take most stringent measures against him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>). The Moabites joined in a league against Jehoshaphat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-22.htm">2 Chronicles 20:22</a>), and later against Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>), and, as we see by the inscription on the Moabite Stone, were always ready to profit by the disasters or weakness of the chosen people. "I erected this stone," says Mesha, "to Chemosh at Kirkha, a stone of salvation, for he saved me from all despoilers, and made me see my desire upon all mine enemies, even upon Omri, King of Israel." And then he goes on to recount his victories. <span class="cmt_word">He burned the bones of the King of Edom into lime.</span> This profanation of the corpse of the King of Edom (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-16.htm">2 Kings 23:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-1.htm">Jeremiah 8:1, 2</a>) is not mentioned in the historical books. Some of the older commentators, as Tirinus and Corn. a Lapide, think that the prophet wishes to show that the sympathy of God extends beyond the covenant people, and that he punishes wrongs inflicted even on heathen nations. But as in the case of the other nations, Amos reproves only crimes committed against Israel or Judah, so the present outrage must have the same connection. The reference to the King of Moab's sacrifice of "his eldest son," even if we suppose (which is improbable) the son of the King of Edom to be meant, is plainly inapplicable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>), as the offence regarded the king himself, and not his son, and the expression, "burned into lime," can hardly be thought to refer to a human sacrifice. The act mentioned probably occurred during the time that the Edomites joined Jehoram and Jehoshaphat in the league against Mesha, the King of Moab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-7.htm">2 Kings 3:7, 9</a>), the author of the inscription on the celebrated stone erected by him at Dibon. Unfortunately, the last lines of that inscription, describing the war against the Edomites, are lost. The paragraph that remains is this: "And Chemosh said to me, Go down, make war against Horonaim [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the men of Edom], and take... Chemosh... in my days. Wherefore I made... year ... and I..." The Jewish tradition, quoted by Jerome, tells that after this war the Moabites, in revenge for the assistance which the King of Edom had given to the Israelites, dug up and dishonoured his bones. Edom was then in vassalage to Israel, but regained its independence some ten years later (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20</a>). The sacrilegious act was meant to redound to the disgrace of Israel <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 The evil passions of the heart break out in various forms; but the Lord looks to our motives, as well as our conduct. Those that deal cruelly, shall be cruelly dealt with. Other nations were reckoned with for injuries done to men; Judah is reckoned with for dishonour done to God. Judah despised the law of the Lord; and he justly gave them up to strong delusion; nor was it any excuse for their sin, that they were the lies, the idols, after which their fathers walked. The worst abominations and most grievous oppressions have been committed by some of the professed worshippers of the Lord. Such conduct leads many to unbelief and vile idolatry.</body></html>
