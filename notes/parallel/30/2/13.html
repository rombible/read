But it is unlikely that God, in this passage, should declare Himself "crushed" under the weight of Israel's sin, for in the context it is Israel, and not God, who is described as the victim, Moreover, grammatical usage is against the rendering of <span class= "ital">m?'iq</span> as passive; nor does it favour Ewald's, as well as Keil's, interpretation "press you <span class= "ital">down"</span> Translate (see margin) <span class= "ital">Behold, I am pressing down beneath you</span> (literally, <span class= "ital">your place</span>)<span class= "ital">, just as the waggon, filled up with sheaves, presses down.</span> Jehovah, in the awful judgment which He inflicts, is symbolised by the heavily-laden waggon. The expression "beneath you" suggests that the evil is not confined to the present. Israel, the nation weighted with the doom of past iniquities, bequeathes a yet more crushing load to future generations. If the text is sound, this appears the only satisfactory rendering of a difficult passage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-16</span> threaten severe punishment for the sins mentioned above. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I am pressed under you;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "I roll under you;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">stridebo subter vos</span>; Syriac, as Anglican; Hitzig, "I make it totter beneath you, as a cart tottereth;" Ewald, Keil," I will press you down, as the cart presseth;" Baur, Pusey, "I straiten myself under you, as a cart is straitened;" Revised Version, "I will press you in your place, as a cart presseth." The translation of Keil, which is that of Gesenius, is most suitable, meaning, "I will press you with the full force of war, as a loaded wain presses the earth over which it passes." The sense of the English Version is that God is burdened and wearied with their sins, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-24.htm">Isaiah 43:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-17.htm">Malachi 2:17</a>. The verb, being hiphil, is an objection to this explanation. The comparison of the wain is very natural in the mouth of the shepherd Amos. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:9-16 We need often to be reminded of the mercies we have received; which add much to the evil of the sins we have committed. They had helps for their souls, which taught them how to make good use of their earthly enjoyments, and were therefore more valuable. Faithful ministers are great blessings to any people; but it is God that raises them up to be so. Sinners' own consciences will witness that he has not been wanting to them in the means of grace. They did what they could to lead believers aside. Satan and his agents are busy to corrupt the minds of young people who look heavenward; they overcome many by drawing them to the love of mirth and pleasure, and into drinking company. Multitudes of young men who bade fair as professors of religion, have erred through strong drink, and have been undone for ever. The Lord complains of sin, especially the sins of his professing people, as a burden to him. And though his long-suffering be tired, his power is not, and so the sinner will find to his cost. When men reject God's word, adding obstinacy to sin, and this becomes the general character of a people, they will be given up to misery, notwithstanding all their boasted power and resources. May we then humble ourselves before the Lord, for all our ingratitude and unfaithfulness.</body></html>
