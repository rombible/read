The sins and ingratitude of the people are aggravated by a recital of the Divine Mercy. By comparing this verse with <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-6.htm" title="That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; yes, and sell the refuse of the wheat?">Amos 8:6</a>, it is clear that the Jewish interpreters (followed by Keil) were incorrect in charging this sin upon corrupt judges, who, by <span class= "ital">bribery,</span> would deliver unjust judgments against the righteous. The sin consists in the perverse straining of the law, which allowed an insolvent debtor to sell himself into bondage to redeem a debt (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-1.htm" title="Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take to him my two sons to be slaves.">2Kings 4:1</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-39.htm" title="And if your brother that dwells by you be waxen poor, and be sold to you; you shall not compel him to serve as a bondservant:">Leviticus 25:39</a>). In this case the debtor was a righteous man in sore straits for no fault of his own. Render, <span class= "ital">on account of a pair of sandals.</span> A paltry debt, equivalent, in worth, to a pair of sandals, would not save him from bondage at the hands of an oppressive ruler (see Introduction).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-16.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> <span class="accented">Summons and general denunciation of Israel for injustice, cruelty, incest, luxury, and idolatry.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They sold the righteous for silver.</span> The first charge against Israel is perversion of justice. The judges took bribes and condemned <span class="cmt_word">the righteous,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the man whose cause was good. Pusey thinks that the literal selling of debtors by creditors, contrary to the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-7.htm">Exodus 21:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-5.htm">Nehemiah 5:5</a>), is meant (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-6.htm">Amos 8:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-25.htm">Matthew 18:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The needy for a pair of shoes.</span> For the very smallest bribe they betray the cause of the poor (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a>); though, as sandals were sometimes of very costly materials (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-1.htm">Song of Solomon 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-10.htm">Ezekiel 16:10</a>; Judith 16:9), the expression might mean that they sold justice to obtain an article of luxury. But the form of expression is opposed to this interpretation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 The evil passions of the heart break out in various forms; but the Lord looks to our motives, as well as our conduct. Those that deal cruelly, shall be cruelly dealt with. Other nations were reckoned with for injuries done to men; Judah is reckoned with for dishonour done to God. Judah despised the law of the Lord; and he justly gave them up to strong delusion; nor was it any excuse for their sin, that they were the lies, the idols, after which their fathers walked. The worst abominations and most grievous oppressions have been committed by some of the professed worshippers of the Lord. Such conduct leads many to unbelief and vile idolatry.</body></html>
