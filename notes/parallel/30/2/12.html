Thus Amos himself was treated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-10.htm">Amos 7:10</a>, etc.). (For proof of this opposition, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-4.htm">1 Kings 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-10.htm">1 Kings 18:10</a>, etc.; 1 Kings 19:2; 22:26, 27; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-31.htm">2 Kings 6:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-15.htm">2 Chronicles 25:15, 16</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-6.htm">Micah 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:9-16 We need often to be reminded of the mercies we have received; which add much to the evil of the sins we have committed. They had helps for their souls, which taught them how to make good use of their earthly enjoyments, and were therefore more valuable. Faithful ministers are great blessings to any people; but it is God that raises them up to be so. Sinners' own consciences will witness that he has not been wanting to them in the means of grace. They did what they could to lead believers aside. Satan and his agents are busy to corrupt the minds of young people who look heavenward; they overcome many by drawing them to the love of mirth and pleasure, and into drinking company. Multitudes of young men who bade fair as professors of religion, have erred through strong drink, and have been undone for ever. The Lord complains of sin, especially the sins of his professing people, as a burden to him. And though his long-suffering be tired, his power is not, and so the sinner will find to his cost. When men reject God's word, adding obstinacy to sin, and this becomes the general character of a people, they will be given up to misery, notwithstanding all their boasted power and resources. May we then humble ourselves before the Lord, for all our ingratitude and unfaithfulness.</body></html>
