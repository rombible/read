The extreme barbarity from which Judah suffered was that her children were delivered up to the implacable enemy Edom. (Comp. the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joel/3-4.htm" title="Yes, and what have you to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Palestine? will you render me a recompense? and if you recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompense on your own head;">Joel 3:4-6</a>.) This may have occurred in the border warfare, in which defenceless Judaean villages were overpowered, and the inhabitants sold to the Oriental tribes through the medium of the Edomites. The utter fall of Philistian independence is depicted (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-2.htm" title="Pass you to Calneh, and see; and from there go you to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?">Amos 6:2</a>). The cities here mentioned are often referred to in the books of Joshua, Judges, and Samuel, and by the prophet Zephaniah.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-8.</span> - The judgment on Philistia. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gaza</span> is here used as the representative of the five cities of the Philistines. Three others are mentioned in ver. 8, Gath being omitted as having long lost its importance, if not already destroyed (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-20.htm">Jeremiah 25:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-4.htm">Zephaniah 2:4</a>, where see note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-5.htm">Zechariah 9:5, 6</a>). Gaza, modern <span class="accented">Guzzeh</span>, was the most southern city of Philistia in the immediate neighbourhood of the desert. (For a description of the Plain of Philistia, see Sir C. Warren, 'Survey Memoirs,' volume on Jerusalem, p. 436.) <span class="cmt_word">The whole captivity;</span> Hebrew, "an entire captivity," the whole people, so that neither age nor sex was spared. A similar complaint is made in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-4.htm">Joel 3:4, 6</a>. What the LXX. mean by their rendering here and ver. 9, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, it is very hard to say. Probably they punctuated the word translated "perfect" (<span class="accented">shelemah</span>) <span class="accented">shelomoh</span>, making "Solomon" stand for his people Israel. Cyril supposes that the reference is to cities which Solomon established among neighbouring nations; these had now been destroyed or seized. The event referred to may be the invasion of Judah by Philistines and Arabians in the time of Joram, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16</a>, etc., and in which it is possible that a compact was made that the captive Judaeans should be delivered to their bitterest enemies, the Edomites. One would rather have expected a reference to some evil inflicted on Israel (as in ver. 3) instead of an injury done to Judah. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:18-21 There shall be abundant Divine influences, and the gospel will spread speedily into the remotest corners of the earth. These events are predicted under significant emblems; there is a day coming, when every thing amiss shall be amended. The fountain of this plenty is in the house of God, whence the streams take rise. Christ is this Fountain; his sufferings, merit, and grace, cleanse, refresh, and make fruitful. Gospel grace, flowing from Christ, shall reach to the Gentile world, to the most remote regions, and make them abound in fruits of righteousness; and from the house of the Lord above, from his heavenly temple, flows all the good we daily taste, and hope to enjoy eternally.</body></html>
