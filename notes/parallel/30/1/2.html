The same expression "head (or 'top') of Carmel" occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-42.htm" title="So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down on the earth, and put his face between his knees,">1Kings 18:42</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-3.htm" title="And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out there; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, there will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them:">Amos 9:3</a>.

The following clause is a repetition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-16.htm">Joel 3:16</a>; and Amos thus connects his prophecy with that of his predscessor, to show the unity of prophetic mission, and to warn the Jews that God's punishments are not directed exclusively on heathen nations. To the nations denounced by Joel, Amos adds others of Israel's enemies, viz. Syria, Ammon, and Moab. <span class="cmt_word">Roar... voice.</span> The thunder is the voice of God announcing his coming to judge. <span class="cmt_word">From Zion.</span> Not from Dan and Bethel, the seats of idolatrous worship, but from Jerusalem, the abode of his presence. <span class="cmt_word">The habitations;</span> better, <span class="accented">the pastures.</span> It is only natural that Amos, the shepherd, should use such terms to express the idea that the whole land, from Jerusalem on the south to Carmel on the north, should feel the vengeance of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">Shall mourn;</span> explained by the following term, <span class="cmt_word">shall wither;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall lose their verdure (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-11.htm">Jeremiah 12:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-3.htm">Hosea 4:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The top of Carmel.</span> This is the Mount Carmel, which stretches boldly into the sea on the south of the Bay of Acre, and is remarkable for its extreme fertility, its rich pastures, its vines, olives, fruits, and flowers. Thomson, 'The Land and the Book;' writes thus about it: "The celebrated ridge, called in the Bible Merest Carmel, and by the Arabs Jebel Kurmul, or Mar Elyas, in honour of Elijah, is an extension of the hills of Samaria, in a northwesterly direction, for a distance of about eighteen miles, terminating in the bold promontory of Carmel, which descends almost literally into the sea. It is steep and lofty where it overhangs the Mediterranean above Haifa, and on that face which overlooks the Plain of Acre on the north, and that of Esdraelon towards the southeast. There is no special excellency in Carmel at the present day, whatever may be said of Sharon. Its name, Kurmul, or Kerm-el, signifies 'the vineyard of God;' but its vineyards have all disappeared. It was a glorious mountain, however, and a prominent landmark; according to Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-18.htm">Jeremiah 46:18</a>), Carmel was a resort of herdsmen. Amos says, 'The habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither,' in the time of the threatened judgment, and this implies that its pastures were not ordinarily liable to wither. This may, in part, have been occasioned by the heavy dews which its lofty elevation, so near the sea, causes to distil nightly upon its thirsty head. I found it quite green and flowery in midsummer. It was a noble pasture field, and, in reference to that characteristic, Micah utters his sweet prayer, 'Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel; let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.'" <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:18-21 There shall be abundant Divine influences, and the gospel will spread speedily into the remotest corners of the earth. These events are predicted under significant emblems; there is a day coming, when every thing amiss shall be amended. The fountain of this plenty is in the house of God, whence the streams take rise. Christ is this Fountain; his sufferings, merit, and grace, cleanse, refresh, and make fruitful. Gospel grace, flowing from Christ, shall reach to the Gentile world, to the most remote regions, and make them abound in fruits of righteousness; and from the house of the Lord above, from his heavenly temple, flows all the good we daily taste, and hope to enjoy eternally.</body></html>
