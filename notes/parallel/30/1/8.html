"Askelon differs from the other celebrated cities of the Philistines, being seated on the sea, while Ekron, Garb, Jamnia, Ashdod, and Gaza are in the interior. It never could have had a harbour of any considerable size, however.... The topography of the place is peculiar. An abrupt ridge begins near the shore, runs up eastward, bends round to the south, then to the west, and finally northwest to the sea again, forming an irregular amphitheatre. On the top of this ridge ran the wall, which was defended at its salient angles by strong towers. The specimens which still exist show that it was very high and thick, built, however, of small stones, and bound together by broken columns of granite and marble. This clearly proves that it is patchwork, and not Askelon's original rampart.... The position is one of the fairest along this part of the Mediterranean coast; and when the interior of the amphitheatre was adorned with splendid temples and palaces, ascending, rank above rank, from the shore to the summit, the appearance from the sea must have been very imposing. Now the whole area is planted over with orchards of the various kinds of fruit which flourish in this region" (Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' <span class="accented">Southern Palestine</span>, p. 171). In spite of its bad harbour, it carried on a lucrative foreign commerce, which was the chief cause of its power and importance (Ewald, 'Hist. of Israel,' 1:247, Eng. transl.). It was about fifty Roman miles from Jerusalem. In mediaeval times there were two cities of the name, one on the coast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-7.htm">Jeremiah 47:7</a>), the same as Herod's Ascalon, and one inland. In its palmiest days the former could never have had a real harbour ('Survey Memoirs,' 3, pp. 245, 246). <span class="cmt_word">Ekron</span>, <span class="accented">hod</span>. <span class="accented">Akir</span>, was twelve miles northeast of Ashdod, and some nine from the coast. Ashdod was taken by Uzziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>), by the tartan, or commander-in-chief, of Sargon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-1.htm">Isaiah 20:1</a>), and by Psammetichus King of Egypt (so. 635), when it sustained a siege of twenty-nine years (Herod., 2:157). Sennacherib, in a cuneiform inscription, records how he treated the two other cities: "Zedekiah King of Ashkelon," he says, "who had not submitted himself to my yoke, himself, the gods of the house of his fathers, his wife, his sons, his daughters, and his brothers, the seed of the house of his fathers, I removed, and I sent him to Assyria. I set over the men of Ashkelon, Sarludari, the son of Rukipti, their former king, and I imposed upon him the payment of tribute, and the homage due to my majesty, and he became a vassal.... I marched against the city of Ekron, and put to death the priests and the chief men who had committed the sin (of rebellion), and I hung up their bodies on stakes all round the city. The citizens who had done wrong and wickedness I counted as a spoil" (Professor Sayce, 'Fresh Light from the Monuments,' pp. 120, 121). <span class="cmt_word">I will turn mine hand;</span> literally, <span class="accented">will bring back my hand</span>; visit again with punishment, or repeat the blow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-9.htm">Jeremiah 6:9</a>; see note on Zechariah 13:7). <span class="cmt_word">The remnant.</span> All the Philistines who had as yet escaped destruction (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-12.htm">Amos 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-9.htm">Jeremiah 6:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:18-21 There shall be abundant Divine influences, and the gospel will spread speedily into the remotest corners of the earth. These events are predicted under significant emblems; there is a day coming, when every thing amiss shall be amended. The fountain of this plenty is in the house of God, whence the streams take rise. Christ is this Fountain; his sufferings, merit, and grace, cleanse, refresh, and make fruitful. Gospel grace, flowing from Christ, shall reach to the Gentile world, to the most remote regions, and make them abound in fruits of righteousness; and from the house of the Lord above, from his heavenly temple, flows all the good we daily taste, and hope to enjoy eternally.</body></html>
