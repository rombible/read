The ground of the awful threatenings is the word of Jehovah made known to the prophet. The reason for the doom predicted on such high authority, is the resistance and cruelty that were offered by these nations to the theocratic people, and, still more, their own moral offences, condemned by universal conscience. The denunciations begin with a judgment upon <span class= "ital">Syria,</span> the age-long enemy of Judah, sometimes confederate with Israel. Then he passes to Philistia, which had been a thorn in the side of Israel and Judah from the days of the Judges till his own. Then he directs his gaze upon Ph?nician cities, the emporium of the most extensive commerce in the world, Next he passes in review other three tribes, or nations, more closely related to Israel in blood, language, and proximity, and which, nevertheless, had often manifested an undying hatred of the covenanted people. After this Judah, his own tribe, does not escape. Lastly, the prophet gathers up all his strength to denounce Israel, then at the height of prosperity and splendour.<p>(1) See Introduction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - Heading. <span class="cmt_word">The words.</span> So Jeremiah begins his prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1</a>), and the writer of Ecclesiastes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:1</a>). That the words am not those of Amos, but of Jehovah, is shown by the succeeding clause, "which he saw." <span class="cmt_word">Herdmen</span>. The Hebrew word <span class="accented">noked</span> used here is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4</a>, applied to Mesha King of Moab, a great "sheepmaster;" hence some have considered that Amos was not a mere mercenary, but a rich possessor of flocks. His own words, however (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-14.htm">Amos 7:14, 15</a>), decide his position as that of a poor labouring man. <span class="cmt_word">Tekoah</span>.

No mention is made of this event in the historical books. It was remembered in after years (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a>), and Amos alludes to it as a token of the judgment which he foretold, such catastrophes being regarded as signs of the majesty of God and his vengeance on sinners (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-8.htm">Psalm 68:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-4.htm">Micah 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-6.htm">Habakkuk 3:6, 10</a>), Josephus ('Ant.,' 9:10. 4) attributes this earthquake to God's displeasure at Uzziah's usurpation of the priest's office (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:18-21 There shall be abundant Divine influences, and the gospel will spread speedily into the remotest corners of the earth. These events are predicted under significant emblems; there is a day coming, when every thing amiss shall be amended. The fountain of this plenty is in the house of God, whence the streams take rise. Christ is this Fountain; his sufferings, merit, and grace, cleanse, refresh, and make fruitful. Gospel grace, flowing from Christ, shall reach to the Gentile world, to the most remote regions, and make them abound in fruits of righteousness; and from the house of the Lord above, from his heavenly temple, flows all the good we daily taste, and hope to enjoy eternally.</body></html>
