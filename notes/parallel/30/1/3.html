(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/10-32.htm" title="In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel;">2Kings 10:32-33</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-5.</span> - Before announcing the judgment on Israel, Amos proclaims the punishment on neighbouring heathen nations for their injurious treatment of the chosen people, thus showing God's care for his elect, and leading them to fear vengeance for their own greater sins towards him. The order observed in denouncing these nations is not geographical, but is regulated by the nature of each people's relation to Israel, and the degree in which they have sinned against her. The denunciation begins with Syria, her hitherto most oppressive enemy, and the least akin. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four.</span> This form of expression is repeated in each of the following strophes, and some critics have taken the terms literally, and have tried to identify that particular number of transgressions in each case; but this is trifling. The phrase and others similar to it are not uncommon, and are used to signify a great number, the last mentioned being supposed to fill up the measure and make it overflow. Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-19.htm">Job 5:19</a>, "He shall deliver thee in six troubles, yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-29.htm">Job 33:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15, 18, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:2</a>). So Hom., 'Od.,' 5:306, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span>: and Virg., 'AEn.,' 1:94, "O terque quaterque beati;" comp. Hor., 'Carm,' 1:31, 13. <span class="cmt_word">Damascus</span> had been an active enemy of Israel since the time that Rezon threw off his allegiance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-23.htm">1 Kings 11:23</a>, etc.), and seized Damascus, which had been tributary to David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-5.htm">2 Samuel 8:5</a>). The history of the wars carried on by Syria against the Jews may be read in the sacred books (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-19.htm">1 Kings 15:19</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-2.htm">2 Chronicles 16:2</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20.htm">1 Kings 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22.htm">1 Kings 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7.htm">2 Kings 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-14.htm">2 Kings 9:14</a>, etc.; 2 Kings 10:32, etc.; 2 Kings 12:18; 13:5, 25; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-23.htm">2 Chronicles 24:23</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-28.htm">2 Kings 14:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will not turn away the punishment thereof.</span> So in the following strophes. Literally, <span class="accented">I will not reverse it.</span> Amos does not expressly say <span class="accented">what</span>; but he means the sentence or judgment (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-20.htm">Numbers 23:20</a>, "I cannot reverse it," where the same word is used). The Latin Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">Non convertam eum</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">Damascum</span>, which Knabenbauer explains, "I will not avert its destruction, will not turn it aside from its downward course." The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "I will not turn away from it," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as explained by Theodoret, "I will no longer disregard its sins." <span class="cmt_word">Because they have threshed Gilead</span>. This is the culminating offence of the Syrians. The word rendered "threshing instrument" (<span class="accented">charutz</span>) signifies a kind of corn drag made of heavy planks fastened together and armed beneath with sharp stones or iron points. This machine, weighted with the driver who sat or stood upon it, was drawn by oxen over the corn (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-27.htm">Isaiah 28:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a>). A representation of it is given by Smith, 'Dict. of Bible,' 1:31, and Kitto, 'Cyclop.,' 1:86. Such an instrument, set with sharp flints in rows, was to be seen in the Indian and Colonial Exhibition of the year 1886, in the Cyprus department. Another kind of instrmuent (<span class="accented">moreg</span>) is thus described by Jerome: "Est autem genus plaustri, quod rotis subter ferreis atque dentatis volvitur, ut excussis frumentis stipulam in areis conterat, et in cibos jumentorum propter foeni sterilitatem paleas comminuat." Such an implement was used in the infliction of capital punishment by David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-26.htm">Proverbs 20:26</a>). <span class="accented">Gilead</span> is here put for all the country east of Jordan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-9.htm">Joshua 22:9</a>). The cruel treatment referred to in the text occurred in the time of Hazael during the reign of Jehu (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32</a>, etc.; comp. 13:7). The Septuagint has, "Because with iron saws they sawed asunder women with child." This is doubtless a reminiscence of Elisha's words to Hazael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:18-21 There shall be abundant Divine influences, and the gospel will spread speedily into the remotest corners of the earth. These events are predicted under significant emblems; there is a day coming, when every thing amiss shall be amended. The fountain of this plenty is in the house of God, whence the streams take rise. Christ is this Fountain; his sufferings, merit, and grace, cleanse, refresh, and make fruitful. Gospel grace, flowing from Christ, shall reach to the Gentile world, to the most remote regions, and make them abound in fruits of righteousness; and from the house of the Lord above, from his heavenly temple, flows all the good we daily taste, and hope to enjoy eternally.</body></html>
