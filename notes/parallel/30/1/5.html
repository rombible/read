But it is possible that it may be used of persons, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> princes or leaders (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-18.htm" title="Their drink is sour: they have committed prostitution continually: her rulers with shame do love, Give you.">Hosea 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-6.htm" title="And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels.">Hosea 11:6</a>); and this seems confirmed by the parallelism. The plain or valley cleft between Libanus and Antilibanus is still called by the Arabs by a name closely resembling the rendering in the margin, "the valley." It is probable that the word rendered "vanity," (<span class= "ital">aven</span>) <span class= "ital">is</span> simply a Masoretic reading, and not what Amos intended. It is better to follow the LXX. and read the word <span class= "ital">On</span> (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-17.htm" title="The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword: and these cities shall go into captivity.">Ezekiel 30:17</a>), the reference being to the Temple of Baalbec, then in ruins, the Syrian Heliopolis. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm" title="Though you, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not you to Gilgal, neither go you up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD lives.">Hosea 4:15</a>.)<span class= "note">[16]</span> The site of Beth-eden (house of Eden) cannot be satisfactorily determined. Kir is the region of the river Cyrus, or, perhaps, the E. of the Upper Euphrates (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-7.htm" title="Are you not as children of the Ethiopians to me, O children of Israel? said the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?">Amos 9:7</a>). (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-9.htm" title="And the king of Assyria listened to him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.">2Kings 16:9</a>, we see fulfilment of this doom.)<p><span class= "note">[16] On the other hand the Masoretic reading seems to have been suggested (if not confirmed) by </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-5.htm" title="But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nothing.">Amos 5:5</a><span class= "note">, where LXX. read <span class= "ital">aven.</span></span><p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The bar</span> which secured the gate of the city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-13.htm">1 Kings 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-30.htm">Jeremiah 51:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-13.htm">Nahum 3:13</a>). Breaking the bar is equivalent to laying the place open to the enemy. <span class="cmt_word">From the plain of Avon;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">de campo idoli</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">bikath-Aven</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a9;&#x3bd;</span>; better, <span class="accented">from the valley of Aven</span>, or <span class="accented">vanity</span>, perhaps so called analogously with Hosea's naming <span class="accented">Bethel, Bethaven</span>, "House of God" and "House of vanity" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-8.htm">Hosea 5:8</a>). Robinson ('Bibl. Res.,' 677) and Pusey refer the name to a valley between Lebanon and Antilibanus, a continuation of the Arabah, still called <span class="accented">Bukaa</span>, in the middle of which stood Baalbec, "the Temple of the sun of the valley," called Heliopolis by Greek and Roman writers (see 'Classical Museum,' 3:136). The LXX. Renders "On" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a> by "Heliopolis;" and On and Baal being both titles of the sun, and indeed synonymous, the introduction of "On" into this passage may be accounted for. <span class="cmt_word">Him that holdeth the sceptre.</span> The king and princes, as ver. 8. <span class="cmt_word">From the house of Eden;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">Beth-Eden</span>, "House of delight;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">de domo voluptatis</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, "out of the men of Charran." This last rendering arises from considering that the reference was to the Eden of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2.htm">Genesis 2</a>, which the translators placed in the region of Haran. The place in the text Keil supposes to be the Paradisus of the Greeks, which Ptolemy (5:15, 20) locates southeast of Laodicea. Schrader suggests a place on the banks of the middle Euphrates between Balis and Biredschich called <span class="accented">Bit</span>-<span class="accented">Adini</span> in inscriptions of Asurnasirhabal and Salmanassur II. But this seems to be a wrong locality (see 'Die Keilinschriften,' p. 327). The passage means that all the inhabitants of valley and city, king and peasant, shall be cut off. Shall go into captivity. The word implies that the land shall be "stripped" or "bared" of its inhabitants. Wholesale deportation had not hitherto been common in these regions. Kir has been identified with the country on the banks of the river Kar, which flows into the Araxes on the southwest of the Caspian Sea. It forms part of the territory known as Transcaucasia. From this region the Syrians originally emigrated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>), and back to this land a large body were carried when Tiglath-Pileser, some fifty years later, killed Rezin and sacked Damascus, as related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Saith the Lord.</span> This is the solemn confirmation of the prophet's announcement, and recurs in vers. 8, 15 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-3.htm">Amos 2:3</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:18-21 There shall be abundant Divine influences, and the gospel will spread speedily into the remotest corners of the earth. These events are predicted under significant emblems; there is a day coming, when every thing amiss shall be amended. The fountain of this plenty is in the house of God, whence the streams take rise. Christ is this Fountain; his sufferings, merit, and grace, cleanse, refresh, and make fruitful. Gospel grace, flowing from Christ, shall reach to the Gentile world, to the most remote regions, and make them abound in fruits of righteousness; and from the house of the Lord above, from his heavenly temple, flows all the good we daily taste, and hope to enjoy eternally.</body></html>
