This ancient covenant was forgotten in Ph?nicia's mercantile cupidity, and Tyre was tempted to sell Hebrew captives to Greeks and Idumeans. (Comp.

The sin of Tyre, the great Phoenician merchant city, was committed in concert with the Philistines (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-7.htm">Psalm 83:7</a>), and was of the same character, except that she is not accused of carrying away the captives, but only of handing them over to the Edomites. It is probable that the Phoenicians had gotten into their hands, by purchase or some other means, Israelitish prisoners, whom they delivered over to the Edomites, forgetting the brotherly covenant made by their forefathers with David and Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-1.htm">1 Kings 5:1, 7-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-11.htm">2 Chronicles 2:11</a>). The cruel conduct of Tyre was quits unprovoked, as no Jewish king had made war against Phoenicia or its capital. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:18-21 There shall be abundant Divine influences, and the gospel will spread speedily into the remotest corners of the earth. These events are predicted under significant emblems; there is a day coming, when every thing amiss shall be amended. The fountain of this plenty is in the house of God, whence the streams take rise. Christ is this Fountain; his sufferings, merit, and grace, cleanse, refresh, and make fruitful. Gospel grace, flowing from Christ, shall reach to the Gentile world, to the most remote regions, and make them abound in fruits of righteousness; and from the house of the Lord above, from his heavenly temple, flows all the good we daily taste, and hope to enjoy eternally.</body></html>
