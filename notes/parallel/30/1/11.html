But another punctuation of the Hebrew original yields a different sense. "As for his wrath, he hath kept it for ever" (almost as E.V.). This corresponds closely with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-5.htm" title="Will he reserve his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end?

The prophet proceeds to denounce the three nations cognate to Israel, of which the Edomites were the nearest and the most inimical. From the time of Esau until now they had been consistent in enmity, and it is this unbrotherly conduct rather than any specific outrages which Amos here condemns. Edom is accused of relentless persecution, inhumanity, savage fury, and persistent anger. (For the brotherhood of Edom, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-4.htm">Deuteronomy 2:4, 5, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-7.htm">Deuteronomy 23:7</a>, etc. For his hostility to Israel, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-18.htm">Numbers 20:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-10.htm">2 Chronicles 20:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-11.htm">2 Chronicles 25:11, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-17.htm">2 Chronicles 28:17</a>.) The prophecy of Obadiah is directed against Edom (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-12.htm">Ezekiel 25:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Ezekiel 35:5, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-19.htm">Joel 3:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Did cast off all pity;</span> literally, <span class="accented">corrupted his compassions</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> did violence to his natural feelings.
