The Ammonites seem to have been a predatory and roving nation, though the abundance of rains in the district shows that they possessed fixed abodes; but Rabbah was the only city of importance in their territory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a>). Their hostility to Israel was first shown in their participation with Moab in the affair of Balsam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-4.htm">Deuteronomy 23:4</a>). Other instances are seen in their treatment of Jabesh-Gilead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1-3</a>) and of David's messengers, and in hiring the Syrians to make war on David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-1.htm">2 Samuel 10:1-6</a>). We have no historical account of the atrocious outrage on the Gileadites mentioned in the text, but it is quite in character with the ferocity of their disposition, and was doubtless intended to depopulate the territory which they wished to acquire. This barbarity is spoken of in connection with Hazael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a>), in concert with whom probably the Ammonites acted (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-16.htm">2 Kings 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-16.htm">Hosea 13:16</a>). Another rendering would refer the clause to the removing of landmarks, and yet a third to the storming of lofty fortresses. But the Authorized Version is undoubtedly correct. That they might enlarge their border. The Ammonites laid claim to the territory which the Israelites had wrested from Sihon, lying between the Araon and Jabbok, and made an attempt upon it in the time of Jephthah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11.htm">Judges 11</a>.), and in later years seized on the possessions of Gad - a proceeding which brought upon them the denunciation of Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-2.htm">Jeremiah 49:2-6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:18-21 There shall be abundant Divine influences, and the gospel will spread speedily into the remotest corners of the earth. These events are predicted under significant emblems; there is a day coming, when every thing amiss shall be amended. The fountain of this plenty is in the house of God, whence the streams take rise. Christ is this Fountain; his sufferings, merit, and grace, cleanse, refresh, and make fruitful. Gospel grace, flowing from Christ, shall reach to the Gentile world, to the most remote regions, and make them abound in fruits of righteousness; and from the house of the Lord above, from his heavenly temple, flows all the good we daily taste, and hope to enjoy eternally.</body></html>
