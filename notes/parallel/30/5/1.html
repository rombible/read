(Vers. 1-3.) He calls her to repentance, while he shows wherein she has declined from the right way. To make this plain, he contrasts God's power and majesty with the people's iniquity, instances of which he gives (vers. 4-12). The only condition of safety is amendment (vers. 13-15); and as they refuse to reform, they shall have cause to lament (vers. 16, 17). This threat is enforced by the two emphatic "woes" that follow, the first of which demonstrates the baselessness of their trust in their covenant relation to God (vers. 18-27); the second denounces the careless lives of the chiefs, who, revelling in luxury, believed not in the coming judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1-6</a>). Therefore they shall go into captivity, and the kingdom shall be utterly overthrown (vers. 7-11), because they act iniquitously and are self-confident (vers. 12-14). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear ye this word.</span> To show the certainty of the judgment and his own feeling about it, the prophet utters his prophecy in the form of a dirge (<span class="accented">kinah</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-25.htm">2 Chronicles 35:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which I take up against you;</span> or, <span class="accented">which I raise over you</span>, as if the end had come.

The Lord still proclaims mercy to men, but they often expect deliverance from such self-invented forms as make their condemnation sure. While they refuse to come to Christ and to seek mercy in and by him, that they may live, the fire of Divine wrath breaks forth upon them. Men may make an idol of the world, but will find it cannot protect.</body></html>
