Gilgal.</span> The scenes of idolatrous worship, where was no true seeking of God (see note on Amos 4:4). <span class="cmt_word">Beersheba</span>. A spot about fifty miles southsouthwest of Jerusalem, the site of which has never been lost, and is marked to this day by seven much-frequented wells. As being one of the holy places celebrated in the history of the patriarchs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31, 33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-23.htm">Genesis 26:23</a>, etc.; Genesis 46:1), it had become a shrine of idolatrous worship, to which the Israelites resorted, though it lay far out of their territory (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-14.htm">Amos 8:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Gilgal shall surely go into captivity.</span> There is in the Hebrew a play on the words here and in the following clause (<span class="accented">Hag-gilgal galoh yigleh</span>), which commentators have paralleled with such expressions as, <span class="accented">Capua capietur, Cremona cremabitur, Paris perira</span>, "London is undone." Or, taking Joshua's explanation of the name, we may say, "Roll-town shall be rolled away." <span class="cmt_word">Bethel shall some to nought.</span> As <span class="accented">Bethel</span>, "House of God," had become <span class="accented">Bethaven</span>, "House of vanity" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>), as being the temple of an idol (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4</a>), so the prophet, with allusion to this, says that "Bethel shall become <span class="accented">aven"</span> - vanity, nothingness, itself. No mention is made of the fate of Beersheba, because Amos has in view only the ten tribes, and the destiny of places beyond their territory is not here the object of his prediction; and indeed, when Israel was ruined, Beersheba escaped unharmed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-6 The convincing, awakening word must be heard and heeded, as well as words of comfort and peace; for whether we hear or forbear, the word of God shall take effect. The Lord still proclaims mercy to men, but they often expect deliverance from such self-invented forms as make their condemnation sure. While they refuse to come to Christ and to seek mercy in and by him, that they may live, the fire of Divine wrath breaks forth upon them. Men may make an idol of the world, but will find it cannot protect.</body></html>
