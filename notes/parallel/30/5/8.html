lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel.">Amos 5:6</a> through the verb "seek ye," so that it may thus be linked to <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-7.htm" title="You who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,">Amos 5:7</a>. To regard it as a solemn assertion "There is one who maketh, &c.," is not satisfactory. We prefer to render, <span class= "ital">As for him who made the Pleiades</span> . . . <span class= "ital">Jehovah is his name, i.e.,</span> The God of the Hebrews is the supreme universal Lord (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-13.htm" title="For, see, he that forms the mountains, and creates the wind, and declares to man what is his thought, that makes the morning darkness, and treads on the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name.">Amos 4:13</a>). This is profoundly impressive, since the prophets were surrounded by the pompous nature-worship of the East.<p>The Heb. word for the Pleiades (seven stars) means properly "heap" or "cluster," and that for Orion signifies "stout, strong one." The appearance of the Pleiades indicated the "sweet influences" of spring, that of Orion the winter solstice. Observe that Amos the herdsman, and Job the Arabian Emir, accustomed to the naked sky of the desert, make these special references to astronomical facts. The death-shadow suggests the darkest experiences of human life. Jehovah pours His light upon the deepest gloom of our lot. He, too, can make the day dark with night, covering the noonday sky with funereal pall, as at the Crucifixion. God is also made the perennial source of the rain, that "river of God which is full of water," and which is ever rising at His command from the great sea.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - Striking instances are given of God's creative power and omnipotence. <span class="cmt_word">Seek him that maketh the seven stars.</span> "Seek him" is not in the Hebrew. "He that maketh," etc., is in direct antithesis to "ye who turn," etc. (ver. 7). <span class="accented">The seven stars</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">kimah</span>, "the heap," the constellation of the Pleiades (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-9.htm">Job 9:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-31.htm">Job 38:31</a>). The Septuagint here has, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, but in Job has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>.

The identification of this term is discussed in the 'Dictionary of the Bible,' 2:891. The observation of this most remarkable cluster among the heavenly bodies would be natural to the pastoral life of Amos. <span class="cmt_word">And Orion;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">kesil</span>, "foolish," a rebel, the name being applied to Nimrod, whose representation was found by the Easterns in this constellation. Some render <span class="accented">kesil</span>, "gate;" others connect it with the Arabia <span class="accented">sohail</span>, equivalent to Sirius, or Canopus. The Septuagint here has, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "and changing," which looks as if the translator was not familiar with the Hebrew word, and substituted something in its place. It reads <span class="greek">&#x1f68;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-31.htm">Job 38:31</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Turneth the shadow of death into the morning.</span> "The shadow of death," the depth of darkness. This and the following clause do not simply state that the regular interchange of day and night is in God's hands, but rather notify that God is a moral Governor of the world. He saves men from the utmost dangers, from the darkness of sin and from the night of ignorance; and, on the other hand, he sends calamity on those that offend his Law (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Maketh the day dark with night;</span> literally, as the Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "darkeneth day into night." <span class="cmt_word">That calleth for the waters of the sea,</span> etc. As judgments are the prophet's theme, this expression cannot be an intimation of the working of the natural law by which the moisture taken up from the sea as cloud returns upon the earth as rain (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-6.htm">Amos 9:6</a>). Rather it is an allusion to the Flood and similar catastrophes, which are proofs of God's judicial government of the universe, when "he maketh the creature his weapon for the revenge of his enemies" (Wisd. 5:17). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is his Name.</span> Jehovah, the self-existent God, doeth all these marvellous things, and men presume to scout his Law and think to be unpunished (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:7-17 The same almighty power can, for repenting sinners, easily turn affliction and sorrow into prosperity and joy, and as easily turn the prosperity of daring sinners into utter darkness. Evil times will not bear plain dealing; that is, evil men will not. And these men were evil men indeed, when wise and good men thought it in vain even to speak to them. Those who will seek and love that which is good, may help to save the land from ruin. It behoves us to plead God's spiritual promises, to beseech him to create in us a clean heart, and to renew a right spirit within us. The Lord is ever ready to be gracious to the souls that seek him; and then piety and every duty will be attended to. But as for sinful Israel, God's judgments had often passed by them, now they shall pass through them.</body></html>
