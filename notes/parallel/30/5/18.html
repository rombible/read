To our minds it looks forward to the final judgment. It is often mentioned by the prophets (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-18.htm">Joel 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7, 14</a>) as a time when the heathen should be judged, all the enemies of Israel defeated, and when Israel herself was exalted to the highest pitch of prosperity and dominion. Without any regard to the moral condition affixed to the realization of these expectations (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>), the people "desired" the appearance of this day, thus foolishly confirming themselves in their sinful life and false security.

The day of the Lord will be a dark, dismal, gloomy day to all impenitent sinners. When God makes a day dark, all the world cannot make it light. Those who are not reformed by the judgments of God, will be pursued by them; if they escape one, another stands ready to seize them. A pretence of piety is double iniquity, and so it will be found. The people of Israel copied the crimes of their forefathers. The law of worshipping the Lord our God, is, Him only we must serve. Professors thrive so little, because they have little or no communion with God in their duties. They were led captive by Satan into idolatry, therefore God caused them to go into captivity among idolaters.</body></html>
