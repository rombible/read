The gate of Eastern cities was the place of public resort (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-21.htm">Proverbs 1:21</a>), either for business (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-7.htm">Deuteronomy 25:7</a>), or the administration of justice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-2.htm">2 Samuel 15:2</a>), or for gossip. So "he that rebuketh in the gate" may be a judge, or a chief, or a prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-19.htm">Jeremiah 17:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-2.htm">Jeremiah 19:2</a>). It seems better to take the words thus than to join "in the gate" to "they hate," with the meaning that those who resort to the gate - kings, chiefs, judges - hate the prophet's reproof, for the following verses show that Amos is referring chiefly to judicial proceedings, and not to his own mission. <span class="cmt_word">Uprightly</span>; literally, <span class="accented">perfectly</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">perfecte</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> without reserve, keeping nothing back. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:7-17 The same almighty power can, for repenting sinners, easily turn affliction and sorrow into prosperity and joy, and as easily turn the prosperity of daring sinners into utter darkness. Evil times will not bear plain dealing; that is, evil men will not. And these men were evil men indeed, when wise and good men thought it in vain even to speak to them. Those who will seek and love that which is good, may help to save the land from ruin. It behoves us to plead God's spiritual promises, to beseech him to create in us a clean heart, and to renew a right spirit within us. The Lord is ever ready to be gracious to the souls that seek him; and then piety and every duty will be attended to. But as for sinful Israel, God's judgments had often passed by them, now they shall pass through them.</body></html>
