Some commentators would treat <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-25.htm" title="Have you offered to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?">Amos 5:25</a> as a statement, and not a question, the first word being read as a definite article, and not an interrogative prefix in the Hebrew. But the construction of the following words forbids this supposition, and nearly all exegetes follow the LXX., Vulg., Targ., in taking the sentence as interrogative. Is the expected answer negative or affirmative? Heb. usage points to the former. So Ewald and Keil According to the latter, the words apply to the nation as a whole, or to the great mass of the people, individual exceptions being passed by. The following verse is then taken in an adversative sense, "To me ye have offered no sacrifices, but ye have borne," &c. The opposition is between the Jehovah-worship, which they suspended, and the idol-worship which they carried on. This is a possible interpretation, as Driver (<span class= "ital">Heb. Tenses,</span> ? 119a, foot-note) admits. But as that writer shows (<span class= "ital">l.c.</span>), it is more in consonance with grammatical usage to translate in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-26.htm" title="But you have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.">Amos 5:26</a> by a future, as Ewald does: "So ye shall carry away the tabernacle," &c., <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> when driven into exile. To this thought <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-27.htm" title="Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, said the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.">Amos 5:27</a> forms a natural development: <span class= "ital">And I will carry you away captive, &c.</span> Moreover, in the light of this interpretation the logical connection of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/5-21.htm" title="I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.">Amos 5:21-27</a> becomes much simpler: "I, Jehovah, abhor the mechanical round of corrupt and hollow ceremonial cloaking wickedness of conduct. Live righteously. Did I exact punctilious discharge of ceremonial in the desert wanderings? [No.] Therefore I shall submit you once more to the discipline of exile wanderings." On the meaning of the difficult clause, <span class= "ital">Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made for yourselves,</span> as well as on the rendering of the LXX. and St. Stephen's quotation of the passage, see <span class= "ital">Excursus B.</span> Kuenen is scarcely justified in founding an argument on this passage as to the origin of the Sabbath.<p><span class= "bld">EXCURSUS B (Amos 5:26).</span><p>Three obscure points render this verse one of the most difficult in the Old Testament.<p>1. As to <span class= "ital">tense.</span> The interpretation to which preference has been given in the commentary on the text--the time being regarded as future--has been decided on grounds of grammatical usage only. But certainly the larger number of commentators have rendered the verb as <span class= "ital">a past</span> tense, "But ye bore the tabernacle," &c., the time referred to being that of the desert wanderings. This view is upheld by Hitzig, Kuenen, Keil, Henderson, and also by R. S. Poole. It is also supported by the LXX.<p>2. The word <span class= "ital">Sikk-th,</span> rendered tabernacle, or tent, in the E.V. and by the LXX., is derived from a root signifying both to interweave and to cover--an etymology which confirms the above rendering. Ewald's conjecture that it signifies "stake," inferred from the Aramaic <span class= "ital">Sekkitho,</span> is to be rejected. The conception of Moloch being carried in a tent may be illustrated from the Egyptian monuments of Rameses XII. Birch (<span class= "ital">Egypt,</span> S. P. C. K., p. 149), refers to a tablet found in the south-west corner of Karnak: "The picture of the tablet represents Rameses holding a censer, and worshipping the ark of the god [Khons], which, partly covered with curtains, is placed in a boat . . . Figures of priests, a sphinx, and standards are in the boat, while twelve priests carry it on their shoulders."<p>3. Both Moloch and Chiun were evidently star-deities. R. S. Poole endeavours to connect Chiun with Semitic deities worshipped in Egypt (see art. "Remphan," Smith's <span class= "ital">Dict. of the Bible</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The name Chiun appears as <span class= "ital">Remphan</span> in the quotation of this passage in Stephen's speech (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-43.htm" title="Yes, you took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which you made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.">Acts 7:43</a>). And both Remphan and Chiun were held by Mr. Poole to be the corresponding male and female deities of Asiatic type, <span class= "ital">Renpu</span> and <span class= "ital">Ken.</span> But the form Remphan can be clearly shown to have arisen from textual corruption, originating, perhaps, in some false analogy. In the New Testament passage the best MSS. read <span class= "ital">Rephan,</span> and this reading has been adopted in our Revised Version, and occurs in nearly the same form in the LXX., from which Stephen was freely quoting. In the LXX. the original order of the clauses has suffered transposition, and it is certainly safer to adhere to the Hebrew text (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/9-11.htm" title="In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old:">Amos 9:11-12</a>).<p><span class= "ital">Rephan</span> arose from the Hebrew text by the change of a single character. Instances of such interchange are not infrequent in the Old Testament. Yet the form <span class= "ital">Rephan,</span> though corrupt, is invaluable, as indicating the true reading of the Hebrew word. The word for Chiun was read by the Masoretes as <span class= "ital">Kiyy-n</span> (according to Ewald, "pedestal" [?]). But the LXX. indicate, and much confirmatory testimony establishes the fact, that the word is to be read <span class= "ital">Kevan,</span> and that Kevan, like the Ammonitish Moloch, represented the <span class= "ital">star-deity Saturn.</span> Thus <span class= "ital">Kaivono</span> is the form of the word in the Peshito. This view is supported by Aben Ezra and Kimchi, who cite Kivan as the name for the star Saturn in the Persian and Arabic. This star (see quotations in Henderson's <span class= "ital">Commentary</span>) was held to exert malignant influence. Schrader (<span class= "ital">Cuneiform Inscriptions and the Old Testament,</span> p. 443) compares the name <span class= "ital">Ka-ai-vanu,</span> the Assyrian name for that planet.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - Ye have always been idolaters, corrupters of pure worship. Your service in the wilderness, when you were little exposed to external influence, was no more true and faithful than that which you offer now; that was as unacceptable as this. <span class="cmt_word">Have ye offered unto me?</span> <span class="accented">Did ye offer unto me?</span> The answer expected is "No;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> you did not so really, because your worship was mixed with falsehood, and was not offered simply and genuinely to me. It is certain, too, that during the sojourn in the wilderness sacrificial worship fell greatly into desuetude, as we know that the rite of circumcision was suspended (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-5.htm">Joshua 5:5-7</a>), the Passover was not duly celebrated, and Joshua urged the people to put away the strange gods from among them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-23.htm">Joshua 24:23</a>). Moses, too, doubtless with a view to existing practices, warns them against worshipping the heavenly bodies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>), and offering sacrifice unto devils (<span class="accented">seirim</span>), "after whom they had gone a-whoring" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-7.htm">Leviticus 17:7</a>). The prophets, too, allude to the idolatry practised in the desert (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-7.htm">Ezekiel 20:7-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>). But to argue (as some neologians do) from this passage of Amos that the Israelites during those forty years knew nothing of Jehovah, or that Amos himself denies that they offered him any worship, is absurd, seeing that the prophet presupposes the fact, and blames them for corrupting the Divine service and mingling the prescribed and enacted ritual with idolatrous accretions. <span class="cmt_word">Sacrifices</span>; slain, bloody sacrifices. <span class="cmt_word">Offerings</span>; bloodless sacrifices, meal offerings. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:18-27 Woe unto those that desire the day of the Lord's judgments, that wish for times of war and confusion; as some who long for changes, hoping to rise upon the ruins of their country! but this should be so great a desolation, that nobody could gain by it. The day of the Lord will be a dark, dismal, gloomy day to all impenitent sinners. When God makes a day dark, all the world cannot make it light. Those who are not reformed by the judgments of God, will be pursued by them; if they escape one, another stands ready to seize them. A pretence of piety is double iniquity, and so it will be found. The people of Israel copied the crimes of their forefathers. The law of worshipping the Lord our God, is, Him only we must serve. Professors thrive so little, because they have little or no communion with God in their duties. They were led captive by Satan into idolatry, therefore God caused them to go into captivity among idolaters.</body></html>
