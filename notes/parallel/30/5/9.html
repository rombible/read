Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;</span>, "Who divideth destruction unto strength." The Vulgate, taking the Hebrew verb <span class="accented">balag</span> in the sense of lighting up the countenance, renders, <span class="accented">Qui subridet vastitatem super robustum</span>, which means that the Lord smiles while he brings desolation on the mighty - a figurative expression denoting his anger at man's pride, and the ease with which he punishes. We may add that Rosenmuller agrees with the Authorized Version in the first clause: "Who strengtheneth the weak against the strong, and giveth the plunderers power over the fortresses of the strong." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:7-17 The same almighty power can, for repenting sinners, easily turn affliction and sorrow into prosperity and joy, and as easily turn the prosperity of daring sinners into utter darkness. Evil times will not bear plain dealing; that is, evil men will not. And these men were evil men indeed, when wise and good men thought it in vain even to speak to them. Those who will seek and love that which is good, may help to save the land from ruin. It behoves us to plead God's spiritual promises, to beseech him to create in us a clean heart, and to renew a right spirit within us. The Lord is ever ready to be gracious to the souls that seek him; and then piety and every duty will be attended to. But as for sinful Israel, God's judgments had often passed by them, now they shall pass through them.</body></html>
