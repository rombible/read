Some commentators say, two prophets; Rosenmller, "God and the prophet." But Grotius, Lowth, Henderson, and Pusey refer it, with more reason, to God and Israel, the expression denoting, not merely God's knowledge of a man, but man's response to God. His practical obedience, his communion of heart and will, are described as "walking with" or "before God." (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-22.htm" title="And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:">Genesis 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-9.htm" title="These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.">Genesis 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-1.htm" title="And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said to him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be you perfect.">Genesis 17:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-13.htm" title="For you have delivered my soul from death: will not you deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?">Psalm 56:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-9.htm" title="I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.">Psalm 116:9</a>.) Will, then, God walk with man, guiding, shielding, strengthening him, if man is not in harmony with Him? This is the first of a series of parabolic apothegms, all of which require a negative answer. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/26-23.htm" title="And if you will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary to me;">Leviticus 26:23-24</a>.) Each states an event, closely and indissolubly related to another in the bond of cause and effect. All these symbolic utterances point on to the climax in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/3-7.htm" title="Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he reveals his secret to his servants the prophets.">Amos 3:7-8</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-8.</span> - Before announcing more particularly the coming judgment, Amos, by a series of little parables or comparisons, establishes his right to prophesy, and intimates the necessity laid upon him to deliver his message. He illustrates the truths that all effects have causes, and that from the cause you can infer the effect. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Can two walk together except they be agreed?</span> or, <span class="accented">except they have agreed?</span> The "two" are God's judgment and the prophet's word. These do, not coincide by mere chance, no more than two persons pursue in company the same end without previous agreement. The prophet announces God's judgment because God has commissioned him; the prophet is of one mind with God, therefore the Lord is with him, and confirms his words. The application of the parables is seen in vers. 7, 8. The Septuagint, reading differently, has, "except they know one another." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-8 The distinguishing favours of God to us, if they do not restrain from sin, shall not exempt from punishment. They could not expect communion with God, unless they first sought peace with him. Where there is not friendship, there can be no fellowship. God and man cannot walk together, except they are agreed. Unless we seek his glory, we cannot walk with him. Let us not presume on outward privileges, without special, sanctifying grace. The threatenings of the word and providence of God against the sin of man are certain, and certainly show that the judgments of God are at hand. Nor will God remove the affliction he has sent, till it has done its work. The evil of sin is from ourselves, it is our own doing; but the evil of trouble is from God, and is his doing, whoever are the instruments. This should engage us patiently to bear public troubles, and to study to answer God's meaning in them. The whole of the passage shows that natural evil, or troubles, and not moral evil, or sin, is here meant. The warning given to a careless world will increase its condemnation another day. Oh the amazing stupidity of an unbelieving world, that will not be wrought upon by the terrors of the Lord, and that despise his mercies!</body></html>
