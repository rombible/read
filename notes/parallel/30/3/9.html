Foreign people, even Philistines and Egyptians, are gathered to witness the evils of the doomed realm. The marginal rendering "oppressions" should be adopted.

He is bidden to summon the heathen Ashdod and Egypt to bear witness to the iniquities of Samaria, which should bring about the overthrow of the kingdom, the destruction of the city with its altars and palaces, and the exile of the people. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ashdod</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-8.htm">Amos 1:8</a>). God bids the prophets (<span class="cmt_word">publish ye</span>) summon the inhabitants of the palaces of Philistia (of which Ashdod is the representative) and Egypt, because they had been the chief enemies of his people, and in their sight had mighty works been wrought for Israel; thus they could appreciate her iniquity and ingratitude. Some, translating <span class="accented">al</span> "upon," say that the prophets are bidden publish their message upon the flat roofs of the palaces, that it may be heard far and near (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-22.htm">2 Samuel 16:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-27.htm">Matthew 10:27</a>). Keil thinks that not all the inhabitants of the town are summoned, but only those who live in the palaces, who alone "could pronounce a correct sentence as to the mode of life commonly adopted in the palaces of Samaria." But this seems an unnecessary refinement. The Septuagint reads, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "Proclaim ye to the regions among the Assryians," doubtless by some mistake of copyists. <span class="cmt_word">Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria.</span> The city of Samaria was built on a hill which stands alone in the valley or basin, but it is surrounded by higher <span class="accented">mountains</span>, from whence, though at some distance, spectators could look down into its streets, and, as from the seats in an amphitheatre, behold the iniquities transacted there. Their implacable enemies, the Philistines, and those they were then courting, the Egyptians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-11.htm">Hebrews 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>), are alike called to witness this spectacle. <span class="cmt_word">Tumult</span>; the disorder, where might makes right.

It was to the eternal disgrace of Israel that there were doings in her cities which the very heathen would condemn. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:9-15 That power which is an instrument of unrighteousness, will justly be brought down and broken. What is got and kept wrongfully, will not be kept long. Some are at ease, but there will come a day of visitation, and in that day, all they are proud of, and put confidence in, shall fail them. God will inquire into the sins of which they have been guilty in their houses, the robbery they have stored up, and the luxury in which they lived. The pomp and pleasantness of men's houses, do not fortify against God's judgments, but make sufferings the more grievous and vexatious. Yet a remnant, according to the election of grace, will be secured by our great and good Shepherd, as from the jaws of destruction, in the worst times.</body></html>
