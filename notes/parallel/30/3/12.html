But this construction is very questionable, and it would be much simpler and safer to adopt the reading of most Hebrew texts, and render <span class= "ital">on a couch's damask</span> (so Gesenius and Ewald), referring to the silken (?) or white woollen fabric for which Damascus, even in that early age, was famous. The relations between Syria and Israel at this moment were intimate. The meaning is that even the noblest and wealthiest will be regarded, if saved, as worthless salvage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - The prophet shows that the chastisement is inevitable, and that only the smallest remnant, the most worthless among the inhabitants, and they with much difficulty, can escape. The illustration from a common incident in a shepherd's life is very natural in Amos. <span class="cmt_word">Taketh</span>; better, <span class="accented">rescueth</span>. So below, <span class="cmt_word">shall be taken out;</span> <span class="accented">shall be rescued</span>. The usual explanation is that a shepherd attacks the lion which has seized one of his sheep (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34</a>, etc.), and rescues from it the most worthless parts - "a couple of shank bones or a bit, or tip, of an ear." But as an attack on a lion would be an abnormal act of courage on the part of a shepherd, and the comparison is with things likely and usual, it is probable that the meaning is that the shepherd finds only these poor remnants after the lion has left his prey. So such a poor remnant shall be rescued from the ten tribes of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">That dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed;</span> that sit at ease, lounging in the cosiest corner of the divan, an image of indolent ease and careless security in the face of impending judgment. <span class="cmt_word">And in Damascus in a couch;</span> LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1ff7;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">et in Damasci grabato</span>. The Syriac and Jewish Versions agree in considering the word "Damascus" to be a proper name. The other modern rendering takes it to mean the material which we call "damask," or something similar. Hence our Revised Version gives, "on the silken cushions of a bed;" and others, "on the damask of a couch." Dr. Pusey retains the old rendering, on the grounds that there is no evidence to prove that the manufactures for which Damascus was celebrated in after time existed at this period, its exports being then wine and white wool (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-18.htm">Ezekiel 27:18</a>), and that the Arabic word <span class="accented">dimakso</span> (which critics have cited as connected with the term "damask") has nothing to do with Damascus, and meant raw, not manufactured, "silk." He translates, "in Damascus, a couch," and explains this to mean that Damascus, which Jeroboam II had won for Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-28.htm">2 Kings 14:28</a>), "was a canopied couch to them, in which they stayed themselves." This agrees with the ancient Jewish interpretation, which explains the clause to mean that the Israelites would some day depend for help on the Syrians represented by Damascus A third exposition, favoured by the Latin Vulgate, makes the words to mean, "on a couch of Damascus;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a Syrian couch of a costly and luxurious nature. This comes to the same as the modern rendering given, above and seems to be the easiest explanation of the expression. The difficulty depends chiefly on the punctuation of the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5da;</span>; or them may be some corruption in the text. What the LXX. meant by their rendering is problematical,<span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1ff7;</span>, "The children of Israel who dwell in Samaria in the presence of the tribe and in Damascus." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:9-15 That power which is an instrument of unrighteousness, will justly be brought down and broken. What is got and kept wrongfully, will not be kept long. Some are at ease, but there will come a day of visitation, and in that day, all they are proud of, and put confidence in, shall fail them. God will inquire into the sins of which they have been guilty in their houses, the robbery they have stored up, and the luxury in which they lived. The pomp and pleasantness of men's houses, do not fortify against God's judgments, but make sufferings the more grievous and vexatious. Yet a remnant, according to the election of grace, will be secured by our great and good Shepherd, as from the jaws of destruction, in the worst times.</body></html>
