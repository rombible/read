Thus the ruin impending, on Israel was sent by the Lord, whose agent was the enemy now approaching. All phenomena are ascribed in the Bible to Divine operation, no second causes being allowed to interfere with this appropriation (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1.htm">Job 1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-10.htm">1 Samuel 18:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>). The verb "do" is often used absolutely, the context defining the result (see note on Haggai 2:4). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-8 The distinguishing favours of God to us, if they do not restrain from sin, shall not exempt from punishment. They could not expect communion with God, unless they first sought peace with him. Where there is not friendship, there can be no fellowship. God and man cannot walk together, except they are agreed. Unless we seek his glory, we cannot walk with him. Let us not presume on outward privileges, without special, sanctifying grace. The threatenings of the word and providence of God against the sin of man are certain, and certainly show that the judgments of God are at hand. Nor will God remove the affliction he has sent, till it has done its work. The evil of sin is from ourselves, it is our own doing; but the evil of trouble is from God, and is his doing, whoever are the instruments. This should engage us patiently to bear public troubles, and to study to answer God's meaning in them. The whole of the passage shows that natural evil, or troubles, and not moral evil, or sin, is here meant. The warning given to a careless world will increase its condemnation another day. Oh the amazing stupidity of an unbelieving world, that will not be wrought upon by the terrors of the Lord, and that despise his mercies!</body></html>
