The denunciation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2, 3</a> is here repeated. <span class="cmt_word">The horns of the altar.</span> These were certain projections at the four angles of the altar, perhaps in the form of an ox's horn, on which the blood of the sin offering was smeared, and which therefore were considered the holiest part of the altar (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-2.htm">Exodus 27:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-12.htm">Exodus 29:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-18.htm">Leviticus 16:18</a>). The instruments of idolatry or impure worship should share the destruction of the idolaters. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:9-15 That power which is an instrument of unrighteousness, will justly be brought down and broken. What is got and kept wrongfully, will not be kept long. Some are at ease, but there will come a day of visitation, and in that day, all they are proud of, and put confidence in, shall fail them. God will inquire into the sins of which they have been guilty in their houses, the robbery they have stored up, and the luxury in which they lived. The pomp and pleasantness of men's houses, do not fortify against God's judgments, but make sufferings the more grievous and vexatious. Yet a remnant, according to the election of grace, will be secured by our great and good Shepherd, as from the jaws of destruction, in the worst times.</body></html>
