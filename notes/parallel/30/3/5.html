"take up" is due to ambiguity of the Hebrew. The idea is that Israel "like a silly dove" is falling into snares. The snare, even now, may be seen springing from the earth. The armies and politics of the nation that will enclose Israel are already in motion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The thought here is that the punishment is deserved as well as certain. A bird is not caught unless a trap is set for it. The trap which the sinner sets for himself is sin. <span class="cmt_word">Can a bird fall in a snare</span> (<span class="accented">pach</span>) <span class="cmt_word">upon the earth, where no gin</span> (<span class="accented">moqesh</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>is for him?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> is set for him? The "gin" is a net with a stick for a spring, which flew up when touched, carrying part of the net with it, and thus the bird was enclosed and caught (see Kitto, 'Cyclop.,' <span class="accented">s.v.</span> "Fowling," 2:36). The LXX. probably read <span class="accented">yoqesh</span>, as they translate, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "without a fowler." So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">absque aucupe.</span> The second clause should be, <span class="accented">Shall a snare</span> (<span class="accented">pach</span>) <span class="accented">spring up from the ground without taking anything?</span> The snare, or trap stick, would not rise if it had not caught something. The sin is there, and the sinners shall surely not escape. When God appoints retributive punishments for the guilty, and announces the same by his prophets, they may be expected with absolute certainty. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-8 The distinguishing favours of God to us, if they do not restrain from sin, shall not exempt from punishment. They could not expect communion with God, unless they first sought peace with him. Where there is not friendship, there can be no fellowship. God and man cannot walk together, except they are agreed. Unless we seek his glory, we cannot walk with him. Let us not presume on outward privileges, without special, sanctifying grace. The threatenings of the word and providence of God against the sin of man are certain, and certainly show that the judgments of God are at hand. Nor will God remove the affliction he has sent, till it has done its work. The evil of sin is from ourselves, it is our own doing; but the evil of trouble is from God, and is his doing, whoever are the instruments. This should engage us patiently to bear public troubles, and to study to answer God's meaning in them. The whole of the passage shows that natural evil, or troubles, and not moral evil, or sin, is here meant. The warning given to a careless world will increase its condemnation another day. Oh the amazing stupidity of an unbelieving world, that will not be wrought upon by the terrors of the Lord, and that despise his mercies!</body></html>
