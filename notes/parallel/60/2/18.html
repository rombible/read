Yes, he shall be held up: for God is able to make him stand.">Romans 14:4</a>. It brings forward the <span class= "ital">family</span> or <span class= "ital">household</span> relation of servant or slave to master, and not (as does the common word used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-16.htm" title="As free, and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.">1Peter 2:16</a>) the mere fact of <span class= "ital">ownership.</span> We need not be surprised at directions for household servants, or slaves, in a letter addressed to <span class= "ital">Jewish</span> Christians, for there were large numbers of Hebrews in this position both now and later; St. Clement, for example, was probably both.<p><span class= "bld">Be subject.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">being subject, </span>or <span class= "ital">submitting yourselves.</span> The participle joins this clause loosely to the "submit yourselves" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-13.htm" title="Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;">1Peter 2:13</a>, where the word is the same. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-1.htm" title="Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;">1Peter 3:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">With all fear.</span>--"All" implies everything which goes to make up true fear, every kind of fear; and the "fear" (as when we speak of the fear of God) is not intended to mean any unmanly cowardice, dread of punishment, or such terror as is involved in having secrets which one dreads to have divulged. One commentator well defines it as "the shrinking from transgressing the master's will, based on the consciousness of one's own inferiority."<p><span class= "bld">Masters</span>.--This is the word which properly corresponds to the word by which the "servants" are described, not merely "owners," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-5.htm" title="Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ;">Ephesians 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-22.htm" title=" Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;">Colossians 3:22</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The froward.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the crooked.</span> Its meaning is made clear by the contrasted adjectives, "good," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>kindly, considerate; and "gentle," or, rather, reasonable, not disposed to take too stern a view of matters. A "froward" master, then, is one with a warped nature, who is unreasonably exacting, capricious, and cross-grained; in fact, one who will deal with his servants in the manner spoken of in the following verses.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Servants</span>. The word is not <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, slaves,but <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, household servants, domestics. St. Peter may have used it as a less harsh term, in Christian kindliness and courtesy; or he may have chosen it purposely to include the large class of freedmen and other dependents who were to be found in the houses of the great. The frequent mention of slaves in the Epistles shows that many of the first Christians must have been in a condition of servitude (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-21.htm">1 Corinthians 7:21-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-22.htm">Colossians 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-1.htm">1 Timothy 6:1, 2</a>, etc.). It was only natural that men should feel uneasy and irritable under the yoke of slavery as they came to learn the equality of all men in the sight of God, and to understand the blessed privileges and the high hopes of Christians. The apostles counseled submission and resignation to the will of God. Slavery was an unnatural institution; it must in time disappear under the softening influences of the gospel. But Christian slaves were to wait in faith and patience. The sacred writers use language of studied moderation, carefully avoiding any expressions which might be regarded as exciting to violence or revolutionary outbreaks. <span class="cmt_word">Be subject to your</span> <span class="cmt_word">masters with all fear</span>. The participle <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> seems to look back to the imperative <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> in ver. 13; the relation of slaves to their lords being one of the ordinances of man alluded to there (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5</a>, where St. Paul bids slaves to be obedient to their masters "with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ"). The holy fear of God, by whose providence they were set in that lowly station, would involve the fear of failing in their duty to their masters. <span class="accented">All fear</span>; not only fear of punishment, but also fear of neglecting duty. <span class="cmt_word">Not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward</span>. Servants must not make the character of their masters an excuse for disobedience; if their masters are froward (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, literally, "crooked, perverse"), still they must be submissive to the wilt of God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:18-25 Servants in those days generally were slaves, and had heathen masters, who often used them cruelly; yet the apostle directs them to be subject to the masters placed over them by Providence, with a fear to dishonour or offend God. And not only to those pleased with reasonable service, but to the severe, and those angry without cause. The sinful misconduct of one relation, does not justify sinful behaviour in the other; the servant is bound to do his duty, though the master may be sinfully froward and perverse. But masters should be meek and gentle to their servants and inferiors. What glory or distinction could it be, for professed Christians to be patient when corrected for their faults? But if when they behaved well they were ill treated by proud and passionate heathen masters, yet bore it without peevish complaints, or purposes of revenge, and persevered in their duty, this would be acceptable to God as a distinguishing effect of his grace, and would be rewarded by him. Christ's death was designed not only for an example of patience under sufferings, but he bore our sins; he bore the punishment of them, and thereby satisfied Divine justice. Hereby he takes them away from us. The fruits of Christ's sufferings are the death of sin, and a new holy life of righteousness; for both which we have an example, and powerful motives, and ability to perform also, from the death and resurrection of Christ. And our justification; Christ was bruised and crucified as a sacrifice for our sins, and by his stripes the diseases of our souls are cured. Here is man's sin; he goes astray; it is his own act. His misery; he goes astray from the pasture, from the Shepherd, and from the flock, and so exposes himself to dangers without number. Here is the recovery by conversion; they are now returned as the effect of Divine grace. This return is, from all their errors and wanderings, to Christ. Sinners, before their conversion, are always going astray; their life is a continued error.</body></html>
