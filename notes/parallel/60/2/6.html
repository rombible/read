The right reading here is not "wherefore also," but <span class= "ital">because</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the quotations are introduced in the same way as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-16.htm" title="Because it is written, Be you holy; for I am holy.">1Peter 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-24.htm" title="For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass wither, and the flower thereof falls away:">1Peter 1:24</a>, as justifying the foregoing expressions.<p><span class= "bld">It is contained in the scripture.</span>--In the original the phrase is a curious one. "The scripture" never means the Old Testament as a whole, which would be called "the Scriptures," but is always the particular book or passage of the Old Testament. Literally, then, our present phrase runs, <span class= "ital">because it encloses</span> or <span class= "ital">contains in that passage.</span> Thus attention is drawn to the context of the quotation, and in this context we shall again find what made St. Peter quote the text.<p><span class= "bld">Behold, I lay.</span>--The sentence is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.">Isaiah 28:16</a>, and, like the last, is adapted to the occasion out of both Hebrew and LXX. Gesenius on that passage gives evidence to show that the early Jewish explanation, current in our Lord's time, referred it to the Messiah; the later Rabbinical expositors, probably by way of opposition to the Christians, explained it to mean Hezekiah. In order to gain a clear conception of St. Peter's aim in the quotation, it is necessary to glance over the whole section contained in the 28th and 29th chapters of Isaiah. "The prophecy here cited," says Archbishop Leighton, "if we look upon it in its own place, we shall find inserted in the middle of a very sad denunciation of judgment against the Jews." Besides our present text, which is quoted also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm" title="As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumbling stone and rock of offense: and whoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.">Romans 9:33</a>, our Lord's prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem is an amplification of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/29-3.htm" title="And I will camp against you round about, and will lay siege against you with a mount, and I will raise forts against you.">Isaiah 29:3-4</a>; His sharp censure of the corrupt traditions which had superseded the law of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/15-7.htm" title="You hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,">Matthew 15:7-9</a>) is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-13.htm" title="Why the Lord said, For as much as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:">Isaiah 29:13</a>; St. Paul's image of the potter changing his purpose with the lump of clay (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-21.htm" title="Has not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel to honor, and another to dishonor?">Romans 9:21</a>), comes from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-16.htm" title="Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?">Isaiah 29:16</a>. Like one bright spot in the sad picture appears our verse, but only as serving to heighten the general gloom. St. Peter's quotation here, therefore, calling attention as it does to the context, is at least as much intended to show his Hebrew readers the sweeping away of the carnal Israel as to encourage them in their Christian allegiance. In the original passage the sure foundation is contrasted with the refuge of lies which the Jewish rulers had constructed for themselves against Assyria, "scorning" this sure foundation as a piece of antiquated and unpractical religionism. Nagelsbach (in his new commentary on Isaiah) seems to be right in interpreting the "refuge of lies" to mean the diplomatic skill with which Ahaz and the Jewish authorities flattered themselves their treaty with Egypt was drawn up, and the "sure foundation" opposed to it is primarily God's plighted promise to the house of David, in which all who trusted would have no cause for flight. In the Messianic fulfilment, those promises are all summed up in the one person of Jesus Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-33.htm" title="God has fulfilled the same to us their children, in that he has raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you.">Acts 13:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-20.htm" title="For all the promises of God in him are yes, and in him Amen, to the glory of God by us.">2Corinthians 1:20</a>); and the "refuge of lies" in which the Jewish rulers had trusted was the wicked policy by which they had tried to secure their "place and nation" against the Romans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-48.htm" title="If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.">John 11:48</a>).<p><span class= "bld">In Sion.</span>--In Isaiah it means that the people have not to look for any distant external aid, such as that of Pharaoh: all that they need is to be found in the city of David itself. Here, it seems to impress upon the Hebrew Christians that they are not abandoning their position as Hebrews by attaching themselves to Jesus Christ. It is they who are really clinging to Sion when the other Jews are abandoning her.<p><span class= "bld">Shall not be confounded</span> (or, <span class= "ital">ashamed</span>)<span class= "ital">.--</span>Our version of Isaiah translates the Hebrew original by the unintelligible "shall not make haste." It really means, <span class= "ital">shall not flee.</span> While all the Jewish rulers, who had turned faithless and trusted in their finesse with Egypt, would have to flee from the face of the Assyrians, those who preserved their faith in God would be able to stand their ground. This, of course, did not come literally true in the first instance, where a common temporal overthrow came upon faithful and faithless alike, from Babylon, though not from Assyria. In the Messianic fulfilment, however, the faith or unbelief of the individual makes all the difference to him: the overthrow of the many does not affect the few. St. Peter adds to "believe" the words "on Him" or "on it." which are found in neither the Hebrew nor the Greek of Isaiah, such an addition being quite in keeping with the Rabbinic method of quotation, which frequently alters words (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-6.htm" title="And you Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, are not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of you shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.">Matthew 2:6</a>) to bring out the concealed intention more fully. The general quality of "faith" of which the prophet spoke, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>reliance on the promises of God, becomes faith in Him in whom the promises are fulfilled. For a like cause St. Peter prefers the LXX. "be ashamed" to the Hebrew "flee away," there being (except at the Fall of Jerusalem) no opportunity for actual flight. It comes to the same thing in the end: "shall not find his confidence misplaced."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore also it is contained in the Scripture</span>; literally, <span class="accented">because it contains in Scripture</span>.

St. Paul quotes the same prophecy still more freely (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>). The rabbinical writers understand it of Hezekiah, but the earlier Jewish interpreters regarded it as Messianic. <span class="cmt_word">And he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.</span> The Hebrew words literally mean "shall not be in haste;" the Septuagint appears to give the general meaning. He that believeth (the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, means "to lean upon, to build upon," and so "to trust, to confide") shall not be flurried and excited with vain fears and trepidation; his mind is stayed on the Lord. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Evil-speaking is a sign of malice and guile in the heart; and hinders our profiting by the word of God. A new life needs suitable food. Infants desire milk, and make the best endeavours for it which they are able to do; such must be a Christian's desires after the word of God. Our Lord Jesus Christ is very merciful to us miserable sinners; and he has a fulness of grace. But even the best of God's servants, in this life, have only a taste of the consolations of God. Christ is called a Stone, to teach his servants that he is their protection and security, the foundation on which they are built. He is precious in the excellence of his nature, the dignity of his office, and the glory of his services. All true believers are a holy priesthood; sacred to God, serviceable to others, endowed with heavenly gifts and graces. But the most spiritual sacrifices of the best in prayer and praise are not acceptable, except through Jesus Christ. Christ is the chief Corner-stone, that unites the whole number of believers into one everlasting temple, and bears the weight of the whole fabric. Elected, or chosen, for a foundation that is everlasting. Precious beyond compare, by all that can give worth. To be built on Christ means, to believe in him; but in this many deceive themselves, they consider not what it is, nor the necessity of it, to partake of the salvation he has wrought. Though the frame of the world were falling to pieces, that man who is built on this foundation may hear it without fear. He shall not be confounded. The believing soul makes haste to Christ, but it never finds cause to hasten from him. All true Christians are a chosen generation; they make one family, a people distinct from the world: of another spirit, principle, and practice; which they could never be, if they were not chosen in Christ to be such, and sanctified by his Spirit. Their first state is a state of gross darkness, but they are called out of darkness into a state of joy, pleasure, and prosperity; that they should show forth the praises of the Lord by their profession of his truth, and their good conduct. How vast their obligations to Him who has made them his people, and has shown mercy to them! To be without this mercy is a woful state, though a man have all worldly enjoyments. And there is nothing that so kindly works repentance, as right thoughts of the mercy and love of God. Let us not dare to abuse and affront the free grace of God, if we mean to be saved by it; but let all who would be found among those who obtain mercy, walk as his people.</body></html>
