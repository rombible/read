Quite literally it is, <span class= "ital">for this is grace, </span>or else (for, like <span class= "ital">grace</span> in French, 'the word has the double signification) <span class= "ital">this is thanks.</span> The passage has some little importance in controversy, as some of the older Roman Catholic divines pressed it into the service of the supererogation theory. "This is grace," they said, means "this <span class= "ital">deserves</span> grace as its reward." It is needless to point out how shallow a view of <span class= "ital">duty</span> is implied in the thought that it was <span class= "ital">more</span> than duty to be thus submissive. Still taking the first translation, others would interpret, "this is a mark of grace"--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, shows that you are Christians indeed; or, "this is a gift of grace"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>a supernatural and heroic virtue, such as must have come from God, and not from you." These two interpretations make good sense in themselves, but they seem not to suit the context ("what <span class= "ital">glory</span> is it") quite so well as our authorised rendering, and they ignore the sayings of our Lord, which must certainly have been in St. Peter's mind, recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/6-27.htm" title="But I say to you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,">Luke 6:27-35</a>, especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/6-32.htm" title="For if you love them which love you, what thank have you? for sinners also love those that love them.">Luke 6:32-34</a>, and again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-9.htm" title="Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.">Luke 17:9</a>. The thought is that where duty is both obvious and easy (as is the case with good masters), people do not lavish gratitude for the performance of it. The best of masters hardly feels grateful to the best of servants for <span class= "ital">doing</span> his duty, though he will be grateful for the spirit and manner in which it is done. Here the "thanks" are put quite generally, as in the first passage in St. Luke: "this is a matter for thanks." It does not say as yet who is to pay the thanks, and we may naturally conclude that the master so served, and all who are cognisant of the service, are the persons meant.<p><span class= "bld">For conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.</span>--This does not mean "if a man is afflicted for his religion's sake." Rather, <span class= "ital">the conscience towards God, </span>or, perhaps, rather, <span class= "ital">consciousness of God, </span>is thrown in to guard against any false theory that patience <span class= "ital">by itself</span> is a thankworthy thing. However unjust the man's treatment may be, and however little he may resent it in act, it is not thankworthy unless his resignation be grounded on consciousness of God's presence. A resignation which comes from stolid want of feeling, or stoical fatalism, or from the sense that it is no good to seek redress--such resignation is sinfully defective. The two necessary qualifications, before patience can become in any sense meritorious, are (1) that the suffering should be <span class= "ital">undeserved, </span>(2) that the man should recognise in it the hand of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this is thankworthy</span>; literally, <span class="accented">this is grace</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-32.htm">Luke 6:32</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span>; "What thank have ye?" where the parallel passage in St. Matthew is <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>; "What reward have ye?").

St. Peter echoes our Lord's teaching in the sermon on the mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:18-25 Servants in those days generally were slaves, and had heathen masters, who often used them cruelly; yet the apostle directs them to be subject to the masters placed over them by Providence, with a fear to dishonour or offend God. And not only to those pleased with reasonable service, but to the severe, and those angry without cause. The sinful misconduct of one relation, does not justify sinful behaviour in the other; the servant is bound to do his duty, though the master may be sinfully froward and perverse. But masters should be meek and gentle to their servants and inferiors. What glory or distinction could it be, for professed Christians to be patient when corrected for their faults? But if when they behaved well they were ill treated by proud and passionate heathen masters, yet bore it without peevish complaints, or purposes of revenge, and persevered in their duty, this would be acceptable to God as a distinguishing effect of his grace, and would be rewarded by him. Christ's death was designed not only for an example of patience under sufferings, but he bore our sins; he bore the punishment of them, and thereby satisfied Divine justice. Hereby he takes them away from us. The fruits of Christ's sufferings are the death of sin, and a new holy life of righteousness; for both which we have an example, and powerful motives, and ability to perform also, from the death and resurrection of Christ. And our justification; Christ was bruised and crucified as a sacrifice for our sins, and by his stripes the diseases of our souls are cured. Here is man's sin; he goes astray; it is his own act. His misery; he goes astray from the pasture, from the Shepherd, and from the flock, and so exposes himself to dangers without number. Here is the recovery by conversion; they are now returned as the effect of Divine grace. This return is, from all their errors and wanderings, to Christ. Sinners, before their conversion, are always going astray; their life is a continued error.</body></html>
