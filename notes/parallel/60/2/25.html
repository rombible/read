The "for" introduces an explanation of how they came to be in need of "healing." "I may well say that ye were healed; for Israelites though you are, your consciences and memories tell you that you were as far gone in wilful error as any Gentiles, and needed as complete a conversion." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-10.htm" title="Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.">1Peter 2:10</a>.) Jew and Gentile take different ways, but both alike fulfil the prophecy, "every man to his own way." The two metaphors, of healing and going astray, do not match very well, but the fact that both are quotations from Isaiah 53 makes their disagreement less harsh. We must notice how deeply that prophecy (the interpretation of which was probably learned from the Baptist) had sunk into St. Peter's mind. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm" title="But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:">1Peter 1:19</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">But are now returned.</span>--The tense of the original verb points to the actual historical time at which it took place, rather than the position now occupied, "but now ye returned." The word "now" is used in the same way in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-10.htm" title="Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.">1Peter 2:10</a>, where literally it is, "but now <span class= "ital">did</span> obtain mercy." "Returned" does not in the Greek imply that they had at first been under the Shepherd's care and had left Him. The word is that which is often rendered "were converted," and only indicates that they turned round and moved in a contrary direction.<p><span class= "bld">The shepherd and bishop of your souls.</span>--Undoubtedly this means Christ. The first of the two titles is of course suggested by the simile of the sheep. The image is so natural and so frequent, that we can not say for certain that it proves St. Peter's acquaintance with the parable of the Good Shepherd in John 10. More probably, perhaps, he is thinking of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-3.htm" title="He restores my soul: he leads me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.">Psalm 23:3</a>, "He converted <span class= "ital">my soul</span>" (LXX.), where "the Lord," as usual, may be taken to mean the Son of God rather than the Father; or else of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-11.htm" title="For thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.">Ezekiel 34:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-16.htm" title="I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.">Ezekiel 34:16</a>, where the words rendered "seek them out" in our version is represented in the LXX. by that from which the name of a "bishop" is derived. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-23.htm" title="And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.">Ezekiel 34:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-24.htm" title="And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.">Ezekiel 37:24</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-11.htm" title="He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.">Isaiah 40:11</a>, which last citation comes from a passage which has been in St. Peter's mind just before, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-24.htm" title="For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass wither, and the flower thereof falls away:">1Peter 1:24</a>.) It is hardly necessary to add that to the Hebrew mind the thought of superintendence and ruling, not that of giving food, was uppermost when they spoke of shepherds, and that the pastors spoken of in the Old Testament are not the priests or givers of spiritual nutriment, but the kings and princes. Thus it will here be nearly synonymous with the second title of bishop. This name suggests in the first instance not so much overseeing as <span class= "ital">visiting</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>going carefully into the different cases brought under the officer's notice. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-2.htm" title="Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;">1Peter 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-4.htm" title="And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away.">1Peter 5:4</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>.) Both words were already familiar as ecclesiastical words already, and as such were especially appropriate to Christ, the Head of the Church; but as they had not yet become stereotyped in that sense, the writer adds, "of your souls," to show that it was not an outward sovereignty and protectorate which the Messiah had assumed over them. "Soul" is a word of which St. Peter is fond (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-9.htm" title="Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.">1Peter 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-22.htm" title="Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:">1Peter 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1Peter 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-19.htm" title="Why let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as to a faithful Creator.">1Peter 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-8.htm" title="(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)">2Peter 2:8</a>), but which is, perhaps, never used by St. Paul in this sense. It is to be remarked how St. Peter works almost every section of the Epistle round, so as to end with some encouragement to the readers to cling to Jesus as the Messiah, and to their Christian state, from which they were in danger of receding into Judaism. He makes even the special exhortations lead up to that which is the main exhortation of the Letter.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For ye were as sheep going astray</span>; rather, with the best manuscripts, <span class="accented">for ye were going astray like sheep</span>. The apostle is probably still thinking of the great prophecy of Isaiah, and here almost reproduces the words of the sixth verse, "All we like sheep have gone astray." He who had been thrice charged to feed the sheep and the lambs of Christ would think also of the parable of the lost sheep, and of the people of Israel who were "as sheep having no shepherd" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls</span>; literally, <span class="accented">but ye returned</span> (the verb is aorist); that is, at the time of their conversion. The aorist passive, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, is so frequently used in a middle sense that the translation, "ye were converted," cannot be insisted on (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-30.htm">Mark 5:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-22.htm">Matthew 9:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-13.htm">Matthew 10:13</a>). Christ is the Shepherd of our souls. The quotation from Isaiah doubtless brought before St. Peter's thoughts the sweet and holy allegory of the good Shepherd, which he had heard from the Savior's lips (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>.). The word "bishop" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is used in a similar connection in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>, "Take heed... to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>);" comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11</a>, "I will both search my sheep, and seek them out," where the Greek word for "seek them out" is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The Lord Jesus Christ is the chief Shepherd (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-4.htm">1 Peter 5:4</a>). He is also the chief Bishop or Overseer of those souls which he has bought to be his own with his most precious blood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:18-25 Servants in those days generally were slaves, and had heathen masters, who often used them cruelly; yet the apostle directs them to be subject to the masters placed over them by Providence, with a fear to dishonour or offend God. And not only to those pleased with reasonable service, but to the severe, and those angry without cause. The sinful misconduct of one relation, does not justify sinful behaviour in the other; the servant is bound to do his duty, though the master may be sinfully froward and perverse. But masters should be meek and gentle to their servants and inferiors. What glory or distinction could it be, for professed Christians to be patient when corrected for their faults? But if when they behaved well they were ill treated by proud and passionate heathen masters, yet bore it without peevish complaints, or purposes of revenge, and persevered in their duty, this would be acceptable to God as a distinguishing effect of his grace, and would be rewarded by him. Christ's death was designed not only for an example of patience under sufferings, but he bore our sins; he bore the punishment of them, and thereby satisfied Divine justice. Hereby he takes them away from us. The fruits of Christ's sufferings are the death of sin, and a new holy life of righteousness; for both which we have an example, and powerful motives, and ability to perform also, from the death and resurrection of Christ. And our justification; Christ was bruised and crucified as a sacrifice for our sins, and by his stripes the diseases of our souls are cured. Here is man's sin; he goes astray; it is his own act. His misery; he goes astray from the pasture, from the Shepherd, and from the flock, and so exposes himself to dangers without number. Here is the recovery by conversion; they are now returned as the effect of Divine grace. This return is, from all their errors and wanderings, to Christ. Sinners, before their conversion, are always going astray; their life is a continued error.</body></html>
