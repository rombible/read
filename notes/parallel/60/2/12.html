It means the visible conduct of the daily walk in life. This, as among Gentiles--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>heathen (the words are synonymous, though St. Paul generally says "those without" when he means heathen as opposed to Christian)--is to be "honest." We have no word adequate to represent this charming adjective. It is rendered "good" immediately below and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-11.htm" title="I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.">John 10:11</a> ("the <span class= "ital">Good</span> Shepherd"), "worthy" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-7.htm" title="Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which you are called?">James 2:7</a>, "goodly" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-5.htm" title="And as some spoke of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,">Luke 21:5</a>. But it is the ordinary Greek word for "beautiful," and implies the attractiveness of the sight, the satisfaction afforded by an approach to ideal excellence.<p><span class= "bld">That whereas.</span>--The marginal version is more literal, and in sense perhaps preferable, "wherein." It means that the very fact of the heathen having slandered them will make their testimony "in the day of visitation" all the more striking, as (by way of illustration) the doubts of St. Thomas tend to "the more confirmation of the faith." So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-1.htm" title="Therefore you are inexcusable, O man, whoever you are that judge: for wherein you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you that judge do the same things.">Romans 2:1</a>, "wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself;" or <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-18.htm" title="For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted.">Hebrews 2:18</a> (lit.), "<span class= "ital">wherein</span> He Himself hath suffered, being tempted."<p><span class= "bld">They speak against you as evildoers.</span>--A significant phrase. St. Peter asserts distinctly that calumnies were really rife, about some particulars of the Christian morality, at the time that this letter was written. It is a mark of a late date, for at first the Christians had not attracted sufficient notice, as a body, to be talked of either in praise or blame. The heathen at first regarded them as merely a Jewish sect (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-15.htm" title="But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look you to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.">Acts 18:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/25-18.htm" title="Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:">Acts 25:18-20</a>), and as such they received from the Roman Government a contemptuous toleration. The first state recognition of Christianity as a separate religion, with characteristics of its own, was the <span class= "ital">Persecution of Nero</span> in the year 64. Now, it so happens that we have almost contemporary heathen documents which bring out the force of this passage. Suetonius, in his life of Nero (chap. 16), calls the Christians by the very name St. Peter uses, "the Christians, a kind of men of a new and <span class= "ital">malefic</span> superstition." Only about forty years later, we have Pliny's famous letter to Trajan, written actually from the country in which St. Peter's correspondents lived, and referring to some of the very persons (probably) who received the Epistle as having apostatised at the time of the persecution under Nero; in which letter Pliny asks whether it is the profession of being a Christian which is itself to be punished, or "the crimes which attach to that profession!" The Apologists of the second century are full of refutations of the lies current about the immorality of the Christian assemblies. The Christians were a secret society, and held their meetings before daylight; and the heathen, partly from natural suspicion, partly from consciousness of what passed in their own secret religious festivals, imagined all kinds of horrors in connection with our mysteries. From what transpired about the Lord's Supper, they believed that the Christians used to kill children and drink their blood and eat their flesh. Here, however, the context points to a different scandal. They are warned against the <span class= "ital">fleshly lusts, </span>in order that the heathen may find that the Christians' great glory lies in the very point wherein they are slandered. "Evildoers," therefore, must mean chiefly offences on that score. It is historically certain that such charges against Christian purity were extremely common. Even as late as the persecution under Maximin II., in the year 312, it was reported that these meetings before light were a school for the vilest of arts.<p><span class= "bld">By your good works which they shall behold.</span>--More literally, <span class= "ital">they may, in consequence of your beautiful works, being eye-witnesses thereof</span>--The "good works" are not what are commonly so called--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>acts of benevolence, &c. Rather, their "works" are contrasted with the current report, and mean scarcely more than the "conversation" mentioned already. The present passage is, no doubt, a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-16.htm" title="Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 5:16</a>, where the word has the same force.<p><span class= "bld">Glorify God in</span> <span class= "bld">the day of visitation.</span>--This "glorification" of God will be like that of Achan in the book of Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-19.htm" title="And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray you, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me now what you have done; hide it not from me.">Joshua 7:19</a>), an acknowledgment how far they had been from the glorious truth. Some commentators understand the day of visitation to mean the day when the heathen themselves come really to look into the matter. This is possible; and it came true when Pliny tortured the Christian deaconesses and acquitted the poor fanatics, as he thought them, of all immoral practices. But from the ordinary use of the words, it would more naturally mean the day when God visits. And this will not mean only the great last day, but on whatever occasion God brings matters to a crisis. The visitation is a visitation of the Christians and the heathen alike, and it brings both grace and vengeance, according as men choose to receive it. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-44.htm" title="And shall lay you even with the ground, and your children within you; and they shall not leave in you one stone on another; because you knew not the time of your visitation.">Luke 19:44</a>, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-78.htm" title="Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high has visited us,">Luke 1:78</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles.</span> If we read <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, in ver. 11 (some ancient manuscripts have <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>), there is a slight irregularity in the construction, as the participle <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is nominative; it gives more force and vividness to the sentence (comp. in the Greek, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>). The conversation (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, mode of life or behavior) of the unconverted is described as "<span class="accented">vain"</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>; the conversation of Christians must be seemly (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>), exhibiting the beauty of holiness. The Churches to which St. Peter wrote were in Gentile countries; they must be careful, for the honor of their religion, to set a good example among the heathen - a warning, alas! too often neglected in modern as well as in ancient times. <span class="cmt_word">That, whereas they speak against you as evil-doers</span>; literally, <span class="accented">wherein</span>, in the matter in which they speak, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in reference to manner of life. Christians were commonly accused of "turning the world upside down;" of doing "contrary to the decrees of Caesar," as at Thessalonica (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-6.htm">Acts 17:6, 7</a>); of being atheists and blasphemers of the popular idolatry, as at Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-37.htm">Acts 19:37</a>). Suetonius calls them a "genus hominum superstitionis novae et maleficse" ('Vit. Neron.,' 1 Peter 16.). Probably the grosser accusations of Thyestean banquets, etc., came later. <span class="cmt_word">They may by your good works, which they shall be hold, glorify God in the day of visitation.</span> The word rendered, "which they shall be bold" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, or, according to some of the older manuscripts, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, beholding), occurs only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-2.htm">1 Peter 3:2</a>. It implies close attention; the Gentiles watched the conduct of the Christians, narrowly scrutinizing it to discover faults and inconsistencies. The use of the corresponding substantive, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a> is a coincidence to be noticed. It is not probable that there is any reference to the heathen use of the word in connection with the Eleusinian Mysteries. St. Peter hopes that this close observation of the lives of Christian people would lead the Gentiles to glorify God; he was thinking, perhaps, of our Lord's words in the sermon on the mount: "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.' Perhaps in the following clause also we may trace an echo of the Savior's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-44.htm">Luke 19:44</a>, "<span class="accented">Because</span> thou knewest not the time of thy visitation" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, as here). St. Peter hopes that the holy lives of Christians may be made the means of saving many Gentile souls in the time of visitation; that is, when God should visit the heathen with his converting grace, seeking to draw them to himself, whether by gracious chastisement or by the preaching of his servants. This seems more natural than to understand the words of God's visitation of the Christians in the persecutions which were impending; though it is true that many Gentiles were won to Christ by the calm and holy bearing of suffering Christians. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:11,12 Even the best of men, the chosen generation, the people of God, need to be exhorted to keep from the worst sins. And fleshly lusts are most destructive to man's soul. It is a sore judgment to be given up to them. There is a day of visitation coming, wherein God may call to repentance by his word and his grace; then many will glorify God, and the holy lives of his people will have promoted the happy change.</body></html>
