The Christian took up a position of complete independence within, and professed himself in a certain sense to be above the laws, by virtue of being a member of Christ's kingdom. This position of independence the heathen state resented, and looked upon the Christian Church as a dangerous organisation. Here, therefore, St. Peter both insists upon, and defines that independent position. "This the Apostle adds," says Leighton, "lest any should so far mistake the nature of their Christian liberty as to dream of an exemption from obedience either to God or to man for His sake, and according to His appointment. Their freedom he grants, but would have them understand aright what it is."<p><span class= "bld">And not using.</span>--The word "as" in the Greek attaches better to the participle instead of to the word "cloke," so that the sentence will run, <span class= "ital">As free</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as men who are <span class= "ital">really</span> free), <span class= "ital">and not as using freedom for a curtain of vice.</span> In this way the true and the false freedom are more forcibly contrasted.<p><span class= "bld">For a cloke of maliciousness.</span>--The uncommon word here used means any kind of covering, but not in the sense of a garment, so that we must not insist on the metaphor of the word "cloke." The same Greek word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-14.htm" title="And you shall make a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering above of badgers' skins.">Exodus 26:14</a> to express the <span class= "ital">second</span> covering of the tabernacle there mentioned, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the uppermost, outermost covering. Grimm quotes a fragment of the comic poet Menander, "Wealth is a covering of many a bad thing;" this helps us to see that what St. Peter means is not ordinary hypocrisy. The man does not profess to be better than he is, but loudly asserts that he is not a slave. Men admire such freedom of speech, and excuse his vices just because of their openness.<p><span class= "bld">But as the servants of</span> <span class= "bld">God.</span>--Such freedom as has been mentioned is no freedom. It is moral slavery. The only true freedom lies in being "servants" (or rather <span class= "ital">slaves</span>)<span class= "ital"> "</span>of God," whose will it is that you should be good subjects (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-13.htm" title="Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;">1Peter 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-15.htm" title="For so is the will of God, that with well doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:">1Peter 2:15</a>). For a slightly different turn of thought, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-13.htm" title="For, brothers, you have been called to liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.">Galatians 5:13</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As free</span>. This verse is not to be taken with what follows, for it does not well cohere with the contents of ver. 17; but either with ver. 14 (Ver. 15 being regarded as parenthetical) or with ver. 15, notwithstanding the change of case in the original, which presents no real difficulty; the meaning being that Christian freedom must show itself, not in license, but in willing obedience to constituted authorities: "Not only for wrath, but for conscience' sake" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-5.htm">Romans 13:5</a>). Those whom the truth makes free are free indeed, but true freedom implies submission to legitimate authority. <span class="cmt_word">And not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness</span>; literally, <span class="accented">not having your liberty as a cloak</span>. The word rendered "cloak" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) is used in the Septuagint (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-14.htm">Exodus 26:14</a>) for the covering of the tabernacle. The pretence of Christian liberty must not be made a covering, a concealment, of wickedness. <span class="cmt_word">But as the servants of God.</span> The truest liberty is that of the servants of God; his service is perfect freedom (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16-23</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:13-17 A Christian conversation must be honest; which it cannot be, if there is not a just and careful discharge of all relative duties: the apostle here treats of these distinctly. Regard to those duties is the will of God, consequently, the Christian's duty, and the way to silence the base slanders of ignorant and foolish men. Christians must endeavour, in all relations, to behave aright, that they do not make their liberty a cloak or covering for any wickedness, or for the neglect of duty; but they must remember that they are servants of God.</body></html>
