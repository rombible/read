"Built up," too, only expresses a part of the Greek word, which implies "built up <span class= "ital">upon</span> Him."<p><span class= "bld">A spiritual house.</span>--The epithet is supplied, just as in "<span class= "ital">living</span> stone," to make it abundantly clear that the language is figurative. In the first three verses of the chapter these Hebrew Christians were treated <span class= "ital">individually, </span>as so many babes, to grow up into an ideal <span class= "ital">freedom of soul</span>: here they are treated <span class= "ital">collectively</span> (of course, along with the Gentile Christians), as so many stones, incomplete and unmeaning in themselves, by arrangement and cemented union to rise into an ideal <span class= "ital">house of God.</span> St. Peter does not distinctly say that the "house" is a temple (for the word "spiritual" is only the opposite of "material"), but the context makes it plain that such is the case. The temple is, however, regarded not in its capacity of a place for <span class= "ital">worship</span> so much as a place for Divine <span class= "ital">inhabitation.</span> "The spiritual house," says Leighton truly, "is the palace of the Great King. The Hebrew word for <span class= "ital">palace</span> and <span class= "ital">temple</span> is one." And the reason for introducing this figure seems to be, to console the Hebrews for their vanishing privileges in the temple at Jerusalem. They are being taught to recognise that they themselves, in their union with one another, and with Jesus Christ, are the true abode of the Most High. The Christian substitution of something else in lieu of the Jerusalem Temple was one of the greatest stumbling-blocks to the Hebrews from the very first. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-58.htm" title="We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.">Mark 14:58</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-21.htm" title="But he spoke of the temple of his body.">John 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-48.htm" title="However, the most High dwells not in temples made with hands; as said the prophet,">Acts 7:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-28.htm" title="Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teaches all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and has polluted this holy place.">Acts 21:28</a>; compare also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-8.htm" title="The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:">Hebrews 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-11.htm" title="But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;">Hebrews 9:11</a>.) All history is the process of building up a "spiritual palace" out of a regenerate humanity, in order that, in the end, the <span class= "ital">Father Himself</span> may occupy it. This follows from the fact that the Incarnate <span class= "ital">Son</span> is described as a <span class= "ital">part</span> of the Temple. Even through the Incarnation--at least so far as it has as yet taken effect--creation has not become so completely pervaded and filled with the Deity as it is destined to be when the "palace" is finished. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-28.htm" title="And when all things shall be subdued to him, then shall the Son also himself be subject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.">1Corinthians 15:28</a>.) The idea of the Eternal Son occupying such a relation to the Father on the one hand, and to humanity and creation on the other hand, is really the same as when He is called (by an entirely different metaphor) the "firstborn of all creation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a>).<p><span class= "bld">An holy priesthood.</span>--"Being <span class= "ital">living</span> stones," says Bengel, "they can be priests as well." They not only <span class= "ital">compose</span> the Temple, but minister in it. By becoming Christians they are cut off from neither Temple nor hierarchy, nor sacrifice; all are at hand, and they themselves are all. The old priesthood, like the old Temple, has "had its day, and ceased to be." Mark, though, that the Apostle is not dwelling on the individual priesthood of each (though that is involved), but on the hierarchical order of the whole company of Christians: they are an organised body or college of priests, a new seed of Aaron or Levi. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-21.htm" title="And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, said the LORD.">Isaiah 66:21</a>.) The very word implies that all Christians have not an equal <span class= "ital">degree</span> of priesthood. And this new priesthood, like the old, is no profane intruding priesthood like that of Core (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-11.htm" title="Woe to them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.">Jude 1:11</a>), but "holy"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>consecrated, validly admitted to its work. The way in which this new metaphor is suddenly introduced,--"to <span class= "ital">whom</span> coming, be built up <span class= "ital">upon Him</span> . . . to be an holy priesthood," implies that Jesus Christ is the High Priest quite as much as it implies His being Corner Stone. The Incarnate Son heads the adoration offered to the Father by creation, just as He binds creation into a palace for the Father's indwelling.<p><span class= "bld">To offer up spiritual sacrifices.</span>--The new priesthood is not merely nominal; it is no sinecure. None is a priest who does not offer sacrifices (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-3.htm" title="For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: why it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.">Hebrews 8:3</a>). But the sacrifices of the new hierarchy are "spiritual, "--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>not material, not sacrifices of bulls and goats and lambs. What, then, do the sacrifices consist of? If our priesthood is modelled on that of Jesus Christ, as is here implied, it consists mainly (Calvin points this out) of the sacrifice of <span class= "ital">self, </span>of the <span class= "ital">will;</span> then, in a minor degree, of words and acts of worship, thanks and praise. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/13-10.htm" title="We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.">Hebrews 13:10-16</a>.) But in order to constitute a true priesthood and true sacrifices after the model of Jesus Christ, these sacrifices are offered up on behalf of others. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-1.htm" title="For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:">Hebrews 5:1</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-16.htm" title="Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.">1John 3:16</a>.) The first notion of the priesthood of all believers is not that of a mediatorial system being abolished, but of the mediatorial system being extended: whereas, before, only Aaron's sons were recognised as mediators and intercessors, now all Israel, all the spiritual Israel, all men everywhere are called to be mediators and intercessors between each other and God.<p><span class= "bld">By</span> (or, <span class= "ital">through</span>) <span class= "bld">Jesus Christ.</span>--The <span class= "ital">name</span> again, not the title only. We all help one another to present one another's prayers and praises, which pass through the lips of many priests; but for them to be acceptable, they must be presented finally through the lips of the Great High Priest. He, in His perfect sympathy with all men, must make the sacrifice His own. We must unite our sacrifices with His--the Advocate with the Father, the Propitiation for our sins--or our sacrifice will be as irregular and offensive as though some Canaanite should have taken upon himself to intrude into the Holy of Holies on Atonement Day. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/10-19.htm" title="Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,">Hebrews 10:19-25</a>, especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-21.htm" title="For even hereunto were you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow his steps:">1Peter 2:21</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye also, as lively stones</span>; rather, <span class="accented">living stones</span>. The word is the same as that used in ver. 4. Christians are living stones in virtue of their union with the one living Stone: "Because I live, ye shall live also." <span class="cmt_word">Are built up a spiritual house</span>; rather, <span class="accented">be ye built up</span>. The imperative rendering seems more suitable than the indicative, and the passive than the middle. The Christian comes; God builds him up on the one Foundation. The apostle says," Come to be built up; come that ye may be built up." The parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-20.htm">Jude 1:20</a>, "But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith," might seem to point to a reflexive rendering here; but the verb used by St. Jude is active, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. St. Jude is apparently thinking of the human side of the work, St. Peter of the Divine; in the deepest sense Christ is the Builder as well as the Foundation, as he himself said in words doubtless present to St. Peter's mind, "Upon this rock I will build my Church." That Church is the antitype of the ancient temple - a building not material, but spiritual, consisting, not of dead stones, but of sanctified souls, resting on no earthly foundation, but on that Rock which is Christ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-2.htm">1 Corinthians 3:2, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">An holy priesthood</span>; rather, for (literally, <span class="accented">into</span>) <span class="accented">a holy priesthood</span>. The figure again changes; the thought of the temple leads to that of the priesthood. The stones in the spiritual temple are <span class="accented">living</span> stones; they are also priests. According to the original ideal of the Hebrew theocracy, all Israelites were to be priests: "Ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, a holy nation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). This ideal is fulfilled in the Christian Church; it is a holy priesthood. Here and in ver. 9 the Church collectively is called a priesthood; in the Book of the Revelation (Revelation 1:6; 5:10; 20:6) Christians individually are called priests, Bishop Lightfoot says, at the opening of his dissertation on the Christian ministry, "The kingdom of Christ has no sacred days or seasons, no special sanctuaries, because every time and every place alike are holy. Above all, it has no sacerdotal system. It interposes no sacrificial tribe or class between God and man." He continues, "This conception is strictly an ideal, which we must ever hold before our eyes... but which nevertheless cannot supersede the necessary wants of human society, and, if crudely and hastily applied, will lead only to signal failure. As appointed days and set places are indispensable to her efficiency, so also the Church could not fulfill the purposes for which she exists without rulers and teachers, without a ministry of reconciliation, in short, without an order of men who may in some sense be designated a priesthood." The whole Jewish Church was a kingdom of priests; yet there was an Aaronic priesthood. The Christian Church is a holy priesthood; yet there is an order of men who are appointed to exercise the functions of the ministry, and who, as representing the collective priesthood of the whole Church, may be truly called priests. <span class="cmt_word">To offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</span> The priest must have somewhat to offer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-3.htm">Hebrews 8:3</a>). The sacrifices of the ancient Law had found their fulfillment in the one all-sufficient Sacrifice, offered once for all by the great High Priest upon the altar of the cross. But there is still sacrifice in the Christian Church. That one Sacrifice is ever present in its atoning virtue and cleansing power; and through that one Sacrifice the priests of the spiritual temple offer up daily spiritual sacrifices - the sacrifice of prayer and praise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>), the sacrifice of alms and oblations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-16.htm">Hebrews 13:16</a>), and that sacrifice without which prayer and praise and alms are vain oblations, the sacrifice of self (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). These spiritual sacrifices are offered up through Jesus Christ the great High Priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>); they derive their value only from faith in his sacrifice of himself; they are efficacious through his perpetual mediation and intercession; through him alone they are acceptable to God. They are offered through him, and they are acceptable through him. The Greek words admit of either connection; and perhaps are intended to cover both relations. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Evil-speaking is a sign of malice and guile in the heart; and hinders our profiting by the word of God. A new life needs suitable food. Infants desire milk, and make the best endeavours for it which they are able to do; such must be a Christian's desires after the word of God. Our Lord Jesus Christ is very merciful to us miserable sinners; and he has a fulness of grace. But even the best of God's servants, in this life, have only a taste of the consolations of God. Christ is called a Stone, to teach his servants that he is their protection and security, the foundation on which they are built. He is precious in the excellence of his nature, the dignity of his office, and the glory of his services. All true believers are a holy priesthood; sacred to God, serviceable to others, endowed with heavenly gifts and graces. But the most spiritual sacrifices of the best in prayer and praise are not acceptable, except through Jesus Christ. Christ is the chief Corner-stone, that unites the whole number of believers into one everlasting temple, and bears the weight of the whole fabric. Elected, or chosen, for a foundation that is everlasting. Precious beyond compare, by all that can give worth. To be built on Christ means, to believe in him; but in this many deceive themselves, they consider not what it is, nor the necessity of it, to partake of the salvation he has wrought. Though the frame of the world were falling to pieces, that man who is built on this foundation may hear it without fear. He shall not be confounded. The believing soul makes haste to Christ, but it never finds cause to hasten from him. All true Christians are a chosen generation; they make one family, a people distinct from the world: of another spirit, principle, and practice; which they could never be, if they were not chosen in Christ to be such, and sanctified by his Spirit. Their first state is a state of gross darkness, but they are called out of darkness into a state of joy, pleasure, and prosperity; that they should show forth the praises of the Lord by their profession of his truth, and their good conduct. How vast their obligations to Him who has made them his people, and has shown mercy to them! To be without this mercy is a woful state, though a man have all worldly enjoyments. And there is nothing that so kindly works repentance, as right thoughts of the mercy and love of God. Let us not dare to abuse and affront the free grace of God, if we mean to be saved by it; but let all who would be found among those who obtain mercy, walk as his people.</body></html>
