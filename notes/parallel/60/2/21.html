And the true reading immediately after is "for <span class= "ital">you, </span>leaving <span class= "ital">you</span> an example, that ye should follow His steps;" not, of course, that St. Peter exempts himself from the need of the atonement or the obligation of following Christ's steps, but because it is his accustomed style to give a charge (as it were) rather than to throw himself in with those whom he addresses. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1Peter 1:12</a>.) There is one important point to be observed. Christ is said to have suffered "for you," but this does not mean "in your <span class= "ital">stead</span>" but "on your behalf, for your good." Christ's atonement for us is not represented in this passage as <span class= "ital">vicarious.</span> He did not, according to St. Peter's teaching, die as a <span class= "ital">substitute</span> for us, any more than He <span class= "ital">rose again</span> as our substitute. So far as the words themselves go, the death of the Messiah "for us" might have been such a death as that of the hero who, in the battle of Murgarten, gathered the Austrian spears like a sheaf into his own bosom, "<span class= "ital">for</span>" his fellow-patriots, clearing the way for them to follow. The addition "for you" conveys the thought that in gratitude we ought to suffer with, or even for, Him.<p><span class= "bld">Leaving us</span> (<span class= "ital">you</span>) <span class= "bld">an example.</span>--This clause seems added as a kind of explanation of the abrupt "because" just before. "You were called to suffering, I said, <span class= "ital">because</span> Christ, too, suffered; for in so suffering He left ("as something to <span class= "ital">survive</span> Him" is implied in the word) an example to <span class= "ital">you.</span>" (This last "you" stands very emphatically in the Greek). The curious word for "example," nowhere else used in the New Testament, means primarily the "copy" given to a child to write from, or a "plan" suggested for carrying out in detail, a sketch to be filled in. It is used in this literal sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/2-28.htm" title="Leaving to the author the exact handling of every particular, and labouring to follow the rules of an abridgement.">2 Maccabees 2:28-29</a>, and in the metaphorical sense it occurs repeatedly in the Epistle of St. Clement; in one passage (chap. 16) apparently with a reminiscence of this place, for the author has been quoting the passage of Isaiah to which we shall come presently, and then adds, "See then, beloved sirs, what is the copy which has been set us; for if the Lord was so lowly-minded. what shall we do who through Him have come under the yoke of His grace?" The leaving us of this copy was one of the benefits of His passion implied in "suffered <span class= "ital">for you."</span><p><span class= "bld">Follow his steps.</span>--In all probability St. Peter used the word rendered "example" without any sense of its containing a metaphor, or else it would accord badly with the metaphor here. The word for "follow" is a strengthened form, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-10.htm" title="Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.">1Timothy 5:10</a> is rendered "diligently follow;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm" title="Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.">1Peter 2:24</a> of the same chapter it is "follow after"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> "dog;" the only other place being <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-20.htm" title="And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.">Mark 16:20</a>. It means (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-24.htm" title="Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.">1Timothy 5:24</a>) rather "to follow up," made still more vivid by the addition of "His steps" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-12.htm" title="And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.">Romans 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-18.htm" title="I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?">2Corinthians 12:18</a>). St. Peter could remember the day when he was called to follow, and he did so literally (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-19.htm" title="And he said to them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.">Matthew 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-19.htm" title="This spoke he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he said to him, Follow me.">John 21:19</a>); but the Pontine Christians, who had believed without having seen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-8.htm" title="Whom having not seen, you love; in whom, though now you see him not, yet believing, you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:">1Peter 1:8</a>), could only "follow Him up" by the footprints which He had left.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For even hereunto were ye called</span>; that is, to do good and to suffer patiently (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:3</a>). Omit "even," for which there is no authority. St. Peter is speaking of slaves, but what he says of slaves is true in some sense of all Christians (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Because Christ also suffered for us</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for you</span>, with the oldest manuscripts. You do not suffer alone; Christ also suffered, and that for you slaves, on your behalf. "Christ himself," says Bengel, "was treated as a slave; he deigns to exhibit his own conduct as an example to slaves." <span class="cmt_word">Leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.</span> The oldest manuscripts have the second person here in both places. <span class="accented">Leaving</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), leaving behind; Bengel says, "in abitu ad pattern." The Greek for "example" is <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x28;&#x20;&#x3b1;</span> word which occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means a copy set by a writing or drawing master, which was to be exactly reproduced by his pupils (see 2 Macc. 2:28, in the Greek). The life of Christ is our model. In particular St. Peter urges us to imitate the Lord's patience in suffering undeserved afflictions. In the last clause the figure is changed to that of a guide along a difficult route, so difficult that those who follow must put their feet in his footprints. We should follow his steps, one by one, closely following him, as the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> means (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-20.htm">Mark 16:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-10.htm">1 Timothy 5:10, 24</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:18-25 Servants in those days generally were slaves, and had heathen masters, who often used them cruelly; yet the apostle directs them to be subject to the masters placed over them by Providence, with a fear to dishonour or offend God. And not only to those pleased with reasonable service, but to the severe, and those angry without cause. The sinful misconduct of one relation, does not justify sinful behaviour in the other; the servant is bound to do his duty, though the master may be sinfully froward and perverse. But masters should be meek and gentle to their servants and inferiors. What glory or distinction could it be, for professed Christians to be patient when corrected for their faults? But if when they behaved well they were ill treated by proud and passionate heathen masters, yet bore it without peevish complaints, or purposes of revenge, and persevered in their duty, this would be acceptable to God as a distinguishing effect of his grace, and would be rewarded by him. Christ's death was designed not only for an example of patience under sufferings, but he bore our sins; he bore the punishment of them, and thereby satisfied Divine justice. Hereby he takes them away from us. The fruits of Christ's sufferings are the death of sin, and a new holy life of righteousness; for both which we have an example, and powerful motives, and ability to perform also, from the death and resurrection of Christ. And our justification; Christ was bruised and crucified as a sacrifice for our sins, and by his stripes the diseases of our souls are cured. Here is man's sin; he goes astray; it is his own act. His misery; he goes astray from the pasture, from the Shepherd, and from the flock, and so exposes himself to dangers without number. Here is the recovery by conversion; they are now returned as the effect of Divine grace. This return is, from all their errors and wanderings, to Christ. Sinners, before their conversion, are always going astray; their life is a continued error.</body></html>
