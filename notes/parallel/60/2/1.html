There had been "malice" (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>ill will put into action) on the part of these Hebrew Christians against their Gentile brethren, and "guile," and "hypocrisies," and "jealousies," which are all instances of concealed malice. Of these three, the first plots, the second pretends not to plot, and the third rejoices to think of the plot succeeding. The word for "all evil speakings" is literally, <span class= "ital">all talkings down</span>--this is "malice" in <span class= "ital">word.</span> Archbishop Leighton well says, "The Apostles sometimes name some of these evils, and sometimes other of them; but they are inseparable, all one garment, and all comprehended under that one word (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-22.htm" title="That you put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;">Ephesians 4:22</a>), 'the old man,' which the Apostle there exhorts to put off; and here it is pressed as a necessary evidence of this new birth, and furtherance of their spiritual growth, that these base habits be thrown away, ragged filthy habits, unbeseeming the children of God." All these vices (natural vices to the Jewish mind) are contrasted with the "unfeigned (literally, <span class= "ital">un-hypocritical</span>) brotherly kindness" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-22.htm" title="Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:">1Peter 1:22</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore laying aside.</span> Those who would wear the white robe of regeneration must lay aside the filthy garments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-3.htm">Zechariah 3:3</a>) of the old carnal life.

The metaphor would be more striking when, at baptism, the old dress was laid aside, and the white chrisom was put on. St. Paul connects the putting on of Christ with baptism in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>, and St. Peter, when speaking of baptism in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>, uses the substantive (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) corresponding to the word here rendered "laying aside" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>All malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil-speakings.</span> The sins mentioned here are all offences against that "unfeigned love of the brethren" which formed the subject of St. Peter's exhortation in the latter part of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1.htm">1 Peter 1</a>. St. Augustine, quoted here by most commentators, says, "Malitia malo delectatur alieno; invidia bone cruciatur alieno; dolus duplicat; adulatio duplicat linguam; detrectatio vulnerat famam" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22-31</a>); the close resemblance between the two passages proves St. Peter's knowledge of the Epistle to the Ephesians. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Evil-speaking is a sign of malice and guile in the heart; and hinders our profiting by the word of God. A new life needs suitable food. Infants desire milk, and make the best endeavours for it which they are able to do; such must be a Christian's desires after the word of God. Our Lord Jesus Christ is very merciful to us miserable sinners; and he has a fulness of grace. But even the best of God's servants, in this life, have only a taste of the consolations of God. Christ is called a Stone, to teach his servants that he is their protection and security, the foundation on which they are built. He is precious in the excellence of his nature, the dignity of his office, and the glory of his services. All true believers are a holy priesthood; sacred to God, serviceable to others, endowed with heavenly gifts and graces. But the most spiritual sacrifices of the best in prayer and praise are not acceptable, except through Jesus Christ. Christ is the chief Corner-stone, that unites the whole number of believers into one everlasting temple, and bears the weight of the whole fabric. Elected, or chosen, for a foundation that is everlasting. Precious beyond compare, by all that can give worth. To be built on Christ means, to believe in him; but in this many deceive themselves, they consider not what it is, nor the necessity of it, to partake of the salvation he has wrought. Though the frame of the world were falling to pieces, that man who is built on this foundation may hear it without fear. He shall not be confounded. The believing soul makes haste to Christ, but it never finds cause to hasten from him. All true Christians are a chosen generation; they make one family, a people distinct from the world: of another spirit, principle, and practice; which they could never be, if they were not chosen in Christ to be such, and sanctified by his Spirit. Their first state is a state of gross darkness, but they are called out of darkness into a state of joy, pleasure, and prosperity; that they should show forth the praises of the Lord by their profession of his truth, and their good conduct. How vast their obligations to Him who has made them his people, and has shown mercy to them! To be without this mercy is a woful state, though a man have all worldly enjoyments. And there is nothing that so kindly works repentance, as right thoughts of the mercy and love of God. Let us not dare to abuse and affront the free grace of God, if we mean to be saved by it; but let all who would be found among those who obtain mercy, walk as his people.</body></html>
