All the most splendid titles of the old Israel belong in a fuller sense to these Hebrews who have joined the new Israel. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1Peter 2:5</a> they are bidden to aim at being what here they are said to be. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-3.htm" title=" For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.">Colossians 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">A chosen generation.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">a chosen, </span>or <span class= "ital">elect race.</span> As originally the clan of Abraham was selected from among "all the families of the earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-2.htm" title="You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.">Amos 3:2</a>), so out of the clan of Abraham after the flesh were these men selected to be a new clan, or race. They are not merely individuals selected one by one and left in isolation, but a tribe consolidated, only the bond henceforth is not merely one of common physical descent.<p><span class= "bld">A royal priesthood, an holy nation.</span>--These words are a direct quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm" title="And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.">Exodus 19:6</a>, according to the LXX. version. The Hebrew has "a kingdom of priests," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-6.htm" title="And has made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.">Revelation 1:6</a> (according to the best reading); which would mean, God's organised empire, every member of which is a priest. Nor is the thought far different here. The word "royal" does not seem intended to imply that every Christian is a king, or of royal birth (though that, of course, may be shown from elsewhere), but describes his <span class= "ital">belonging</span> to the King as we might speak of the royal apartments, the royal borough, the royal establishment, or even of the royal servants. The substitution, therefore, of "royal priesthood" for "kingdom of priests" brings out more clearly the personal relation to the Personal King. But if the writer had said" royal priests," the notion of organisation would have slipped out of sight altogether. By way of compensation, therefore, it is restored in the substitution of "priesthood" (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1Peter 2:5</a>) instead of "priests." This, and the next phrase, "an holy (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, consecrated) nation," describe the whole Israelite nation as they stood beneath Mount Sinai. This must be taken into consideration in dealing with the doctrine of the Christian ministry. The sacerdotal office was as common to all Israelites under the Law as it is to all the new Israel under the Gospel.<p><span class= "bld">A peculiar people.</span>--This curious phrase is literally, <span class= "ital">a people for a special reservation.</span> It is, no doubt, intended to represent <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm" title="Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth is mine:">Exodus 19:5</a>, though it differs both from the Greek and the Hebrew, the variation being due to a recollection of the Greek of two other passages of the Old Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-21.htm" title="This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise.">Isaiah 43:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-17.htm" title="And they shall be mine, said the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son that serves him.">Malachi 3:17</a>). The word rendered "peculiar" means properly "making over and above," and would be represented in Latin by the word <span class= "ital">peculium, </span>which means a man's private pocket-money, as, for instance, the money a slave could make by working over hours, or such as a wife might have apart from her husband. When children speak of a thing being their "very own" it exactly expresses what we have here. From this sense of "making over and above," by working out of hours, the word comes in other places to mean "earning by hard work," in such a way as to establish peculiar rights of property over the thing earned. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>, where St. Paul is probably thinking of the passage of Isaiah above referred to, both the hard earning and the special possession are intended: "the Church of God, which He won so hard for His very own, by His own blood." Here, perhaps, the thought of "earning" is less obvious, and it means "a people to be His very own." Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm" title="For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,">1Thessalonians 5:9</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a>, where (according to Dr. Lightfoot) it means "for a redemption which consists of taking possession of us for His own."<p><span class= "bld">That ye should shew forth the praises.</span>--This is an adaptation, though not exactly according to the LXX., of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-21.htm" title="This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise.">Isaiah 43:21</a>, which passage is brought to St. Peter's mind by the word rendered "peculiar." The word "praises" is put here in accordance with the English version there. The Greek means "virtues," or "powers," or "excellencies," a rare word in the New Testament (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-3.htm" title="According as his divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue:">2Peter 1:3</a>). And the word for "shew forth," which is nowhere else found in the New Testament, means by rights "to proclaim to those without what has taken place within." This strict signification is very suitable here. St. Peter says that God has taken us for a people peculiarly near to Him, and the purpose is, not that we may stand within His courts and praise Him, but that we may carry to others the tidings of what we have been admitted to see. This was the true function of the old Israel, "Do My <span class= "ital">prophets</span> no harm" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-15.htm" title="Saying, Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm.">Psalm 105:15</a>). They were not elect for their own sake, but to act as God's exponents to the world. This function they abdicated by their selfish exclusiveness, and it has descended to the new Israel. St. Peter and St. Paul are at one.<p><span class= "bld">Of him who hath called you out of darkness.</span>--This is to be understood of the Father, not of Christ. For one thing, the act of calling is almost always ascribed in the New Testament to God Himself; and for another thing, it is probable that St. Peter regards our Lord as Head of this "people of God," just as He is corner-stone of the Temple, and High Priest of the hierarchy. The act of calling (literally it is, <span class= "ital">'who called, </span>not "who <span class= "ital">hath</span> called") was that of sending the preachers of the gospel to them, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>St. Paul and his followers (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1Peter 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-25.htm" title="But the word of the Lord endures for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached to you.">1Peter 1:25</a>). Here again, then, we have St. Peter speaking in praise of St. Paul's mission, and, indeed, speaking in the same tones of unbounded admiration: "His marvellous light." But could Hebrew Christians be said to have gone through so great a change in becoming believers? Had they been in "darkness?" We may answer that St. Peter's use of the word "marvellous" is no affectation of sympathy. He himself found the change to be what he here describes, therefore there is no difficulty in supposing that other Hebrews should have found it so too. Besides which, the state of the Jews immediately before Christ and without Him is often described as "darkness." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-16.htm" title="The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.">Matthew 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-79.htm" title="To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.">Luke 1:79</a>.) This very passage is quoted a few years later by St. Clement of Rome (chap. 36), as applying to himself among others, and Dr. Lightfoot has clearly established that St. Clement was a Jew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But ye are a chosen generation</span>. The pronoun "ye" is emphatic. St. Peter is drawing a contrast between the disobedient and unbelieving Jews and Christian people whether Jews or Gentiles; he ascribes to Christians, in a series of phrases quoted from the Old Testament, the various privileges which had belonged to the children of Israel. The words, "a chosen generation" (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>), are from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-20.htm">Isaiah 43:20</a>, <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. The Cornerstone is elect, precious; the living stones built thereupon are elect likewise. The whole Christian Church is addressed as an elect race, one race, because all its members are begotten again of the one Father. <span class="cmt_word">A royal priesthood</span>. Instead of "holy," as in ver. 5, St. Peter has here the epithet "royal." He follows the Septuagint Version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>; the Hebrew has "a kingdom of priests." The word "royal" may mean that God's elect shall sit with Christ in his throne, and reign with him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>), and that in some sense they reign with him now over their lower nature, their desires and appetites; or, more probably, the priesthood of Christians is called "royal" because it belongs to the King - "a priesthood serving Jehovah the King, just as we speak of 'the royal household'" (Weiss, quoted by Huther). <span class="cmt_word">An holy nation.</span> Also from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>. The Israelites were a holy nation as separated from the heathen and consecrated to God's service by circumcision.

God says of them, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-21.htm">Isaiah 43:21</a>, "This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise;" rendered by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, God hath now chosen us Christians to be the Israel of God; the Christian Church is his <span class="accented">peeulium</span>, his treasure, "a people for God's own possession" (Revised Version). The literal meaning of the Greek words used by St. Peter is "a people for acquisition," or "for keeping safe," the verb having the sense of "gaining, acquiring," and also that of "preserving, keeping for one's self" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:9</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>, "The Church of God, which he purchased (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) with his own blood"). <span class="cmt_word">That ye should show forth the praises of him.</span> That ye should tell out, publish abroad. The verb is found nowhere else in the New Testament. The word translated "praises" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>, literally, "virtues"), so very common in classical writers, occurs in the New Testament only here, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-3.htm">2 Peter 1:3, 5</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>. Here St. Peter is quoting from the Septuagint Version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-21.htm">Isaiah 43:21</a> (the word is similarly used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-12.htm">Isaiah 42:12</a> and Isaiah 63:7). Perhaps the best rendering is that of the Revised Version, "excellencies." <span class="cmt_word">Who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</span> He had chosen them before the foundation of the world; he called them when they received the gospel: "Whom he did predestinate, them he also called." He called them out of the darkness of ignorance and sin. The Gentiles walked in utter darkness, in less measure the Jews also. The light of his presence is marvelous, wonderful; those who walk in that light feel something of its irradiating glory. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Evil-speaking is a sign of malice and guile in the heart; and hinders our profiting by the word of God. A new life needs suitable food. Infants desire milk, and make the best endeavours for it which they are able to do; such must be a Christian's desires after the word of God. Our Lord Jesus Christ is very merciful to us miserable sinners; and he has a fulness of grace. But even the best of God's servants, in this life, have only a taste of the consolations of God. Christ is called a Stone, to teach his servants that he is their protection and security, the foundation on which they are built. He is precious in the excellence of his nature, the dignity of his office, and the glory of his services. All true believers are a holy priesthood; sacred to God, serviceable to others, endowed with heavenly gifts and graces. But the most spiritual sacrifices of the best in prayer and praise are not acceptable, except through Jesus Christ. Christ is the chief Corner-stone, that unites the whole number of believers into one everlasting temple, and bears the weight of the whole fabric. Elected, or chosen, for a foundation that is everlasting. Precious beyond compare, by all that can give worth. To be built on Christ means, to believe in him; but in this many deceive themselves, they consider not what it is, nor the necessity of it, to partake of the salvation he has wrought. Though the frame of the world were falling to pieces, that man who is built on this foundation may hear it without fear. He shall not be confounded. The believing soul makes haste to Christ, but it never finds cause to hasten from him. All true Christians are a chosen generation; they make one family, a people distinct from the world: of another spirit, principle, and practice; which they could never be, if they were not chosen in Christ to be such, and sanctified by his Spirit. Their first state is a state of gross darkness, but they are called out of darkness into a state of joy, pleasure, and prosperity; that they should show forth the praises of the Lord by their profession of his truth, and their good conduct. How vast their obligations to Him who has made them his people, and has shown mercy to them! To be without this mercy is a woful state, though a man have all worldly enjoyments. And there is nothing that so kindly works repentance, as right thoughts of the mercy and love of God. Let us not dare to abuse and affront the free grace of God, if we mean to be saved by it; but let all who would be found among those who obtain mercy, walk as his people.</body></html>
