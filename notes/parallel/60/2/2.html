They are said to be still but newborn because they are still so far from maturity in Christ, as these sins testified. The metaphor is said to be not uncommon in Rabbinical writers to denote proselytes. St. Peter would, therefore, be describing Jews who had newly received the word of God, as <span class= "ital">proselytes</span> of the new Israel. "As" means "in keeping with your character of." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-14.htm" title="As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:">1Peter 1:14</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Desire the sincere milk.</span>--The word for "desire" here is a strong word--<span class= "ital">get an appetite for it.</span> Bengel is perhaps right when he says on "newborn babes," "It is their only occupation, so strong is their desire for it." St. Peter here again seems to lend a thought to the writer to the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/5-12.htm" title="For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.">Hebrews 5:12-14</a>). In both places Jewish Christians are beginning to rebel against the Gospel instructions, and in both places they are warned that they have not yet outgrown the need of the very simplest elements of the Gospel. The epithet "sincere" should have been rendered <span class= "ital">guileless, </span>as it contains a contrast with "guile" in the verse before; perhaps the intention of the epithet may be to rebuke the attempt to deal deceitfully with the Old Testament Scriptures after the example of the Septuagint passage quoted above.<p><span class= "bld">Of the word.</span>--This translation of the original adjective cannot possibly be right. The only other place in the New Testament where it is used, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a>, will show clearly enough its meaning here. There it is rendered "your <span class= "ital">reasonable</span> service"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>not "the service which may be reasonably expected of you," but "the ritual worship which is performed by the reason, not by the body." So here, "the reasonable guileless milk" will mean "the guileless milk which is sucked in, not by the lips, but by the reason." The metaphor of milk (though used by St. Paul, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-2.htm" title="I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for till now you were not able to bear it, neither yet now are you able.">1Corinthians 3:2</a>) was not so hackneyed as now; and the Apostle wished to soften it a little, and explain it by calling it mental milk," just as (so Huther points out) he explained the metaphor in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-13.htm" title="Why gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;">1Peter 1:13</a>, by adding "of your mind." It is needless to add that the "mental milk" would, as a matter of fact, be "the milk of the word," and that the Apostle is pressing his readers to cling with ardent attachment to the evangelical religion taught them by the Pauline party.<p><span class= "bld">That ye may grow thereby.</span>--All the best manuscripts and versions add "unto salvation," which may confidently be adopted into the text. "Grow" is, of course, said in reference to the infant state of the converts as yet, and the maturity set before them (children long to be grown up) is spoken of as "salvation." When we compare this with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm" title="For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;">1Peter 1:18</a>, we see that the perfect emancipation from Jewish superstitions is a main part of the "salvation" to which they are to grow up.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As newborn babes</span>. The words look back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3, 23</a>. God begat them again; they were new-born babes in Christ, they must remember their regeneration. The rabbis used the same metaphor of their proselytes; but the apostle was doubtless thinking of the Savior's words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-3.htm">Matthew 18:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-14.htm">Mark 10:14, 15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Desire the sincere milk of the Word.</span> <span class="accented">Desire</span>, long for it eagerly (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>)<span class="accented">, as</span> babes long for milk, their proper food, the only food necessary for them. It seems that in the adjective <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (paraphrased in the Authorized Version "of the Word," rendered "spiritual" or "reasonable" in the Revised Version) there must be a reference to the Word of God (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-23.htm">1 Peter 1:23</a> as the instrument of regeneration, and called by our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>) the food of man (but the Greek in Matthew is <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-25.htm">1 Peter 1:25</a>). The paraphrase of the Authorized Version gives the general meaning; but the adjective means literally, "reasonable" or "rational." The apostle is not thinking of natural milk, but of that nourishment which the Christian reason can regard as milk for the soul - spiritual food, pure and simple and nourishing, capable of supporting and strengthening those newborn babes who not long ago had been begotten again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the Word of God. The adjective occurs only in one other place of Holy Scripture (possibly St. Peter may have read it there) - <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, where it means the service of the sanctified reason as opposed to the mechanical observance of formal rites. It is explained by Chrysostom as <span class="accented">ebony</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3c0;&#x1ffd;&#x3bd;</span> Thus it seems nearly to correspond with the use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, spiritual, by St. Peter in ver. 5 of this chapter, and by St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-3.htm">1 Corinthians 10:3, 4</a>. St. Paul also speaks of milk as the proper food of babes in Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-2.htm">1 Corinthians 3:2</a>; comp: also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>), though the thought is somewhat different; for St. Peter's words do not convey any reproof for want of progress. This spiritual milk is <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, pure, unadulterated (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That ye may grow thereby</span>; literally, <span class="accented">therein</span>, in the use of it. All the most ancient manuscripts add the words, "unto salvation." The soul which feeds upon the pure milk of the Word groweth continually unto salvation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Evil-speaking is a sign of malice and guile in the heart; and hinders our profiting by the word of God. A new life needs suitable food. Infants desire milk, and make the best endeavours for it which they are able to do; such must be a Christian's desires after the word of God. Our Lord Jesus Christ is very merciful to us miserable sinners; and he has a fulness of grace. But even the best of God's servants, in this life, have only a taste of the consolations of God. Christ is called a Stone, to teach his servants that he is their protection and security, the foundation on which they are built. He is precious in the excellence of his nature, the dignity of his office, and the glory of his services. All true believers are a holy priesthood; sacred to God, serviceable to others, endowed with heavenly gifts and graces. But the most spiritual sacrifices of the best in prayer and praise are not acceptable, except through Jesus Christ. Christ is the chief Corner-stone, that unites the whole number of believers into one everlasting temple, and bears the weight of the whole fabric. Elected, or chosen, for a foundation that is everlasting. Precious beyond compare, by all that can give worth. To be built on Christ means, to believe in him; but in this many deceive themselves, they consider not what it is, nor the necessity of it, to partake of the salvation he has wrought. Though the frame of the world were falling to pieces, that man who is built on this foundation may hear it without fear. He shall not be confounded. The believing soul makes haste to Christ, but it never finds cause to hasten from him. All true Christians are a chosen generation; they make one family, a people distinct from the world: of another spirit, principle, and practice; which they could never be, if they were not chosen in Christ to be such, and sanctified by his Spirit. Their first state is a state of gross darkness, but they are called out of darkness into a state of joy, pleasure, and prosperity; that they should show forth the praises of the Lord by their profession of his truth, and their good conduct. How vast their obligations to Him who has made them his people, and has shown mercy to them! To be without this mercy is a woful state, though a man have all worldly enjoyments. And there is nothing that so kindly works repentance, as right thoughts of the mercy and love of God. Let us not dare to abuse and affront the free grace of God, if we mean to be saved by it; but let all who would be found among those who obtain mercy, walk as his people.</body></html>
