See a very similar construction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm" title="For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication:">1Thessalonians 4:3</a>. The "well-doing" of this and the last verse bears the most general sense of good conduct, not the special sense noticed on the "fair works" and "fair life" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1Peter 2:12</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Put to silence the ignorance of foolish men.</span>--A very contemptuous expression, the word for "put to silence" being the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-9.htm" title="For it is written in the law of Moses, You shall not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treads out the corn. Does God take care for oxen?">1Corinthians 9:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-18.htm" title="For the scripture said, You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the corn. And, The laborer is worthy of his reward.">1Timothy 5:18</a>, to "muzzle" or "gag," implying that there is something of the animal about these "foolish men." The same contempt appears in each word of the clause, even down to "men," which might be rendered "people" or "creatures." The word for "ignorance" implies a stolid and wilful ignorance, and is so used by heathen authors, as well as very markedly in the only other place in the New Testament, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-34.htm" title="Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.">1Corinthians 15:34</a>. "Foolish," too, contains moral reprobation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-40.htm" title="You fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?">Luke 11:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-20.htm" title="But God said to him, You fool, this night your soul shall be required of you: then whose shall those things be, which you have provided?">Luke 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-36.htm" title="You fool, that which you sow is not quickened, except it die:">1Corinthians 15:36</a>. suggesting <span class= "ital">thoughtlessness</span> rather than <span class= "ital">senselessness.</span> The definite article is also used in the Greek (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-2.htm" title="And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.">2Thessalonians 3:2</a>), and again seems to indicate that St. Peter had some particular enemies in view who had brought the charges. This accusation was evidently one of a <span class= "ital">political</span> nature; and, indeed, history shows us that the hostility of the empire to the faith was entirely based on the corporate nature of the Christian religion. They would not have minded the <span class= "ital">cultus, </span>but they could not tolerate the <span class= "ital">Church.</span> Pliny distinctly says in his letter to Trajan, that it was in consequence of Trajan's issuing an order against <span class= "ital">het?ri?</span> or societies, that he was led to contend with the Christians in Bithynia.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For so is the will of God, that with well-doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men.</span> The Gentiles speak against the Christians as evil-doers; they are to put their accusers to silence by well-doing; this is to be their answer rather than indignant self-vindication. The Greek word rendered "put to silence" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>) means literally "to muzzle" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-12.htm">Matthew 22:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-10.htm">1 Corinthians 9:10</a>). The word for "ignorance" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) occurs, besides this passage, only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-34.htm">1 Corinthians 15:34</a>, where it evidently means "culpable, self-caused ignorance." The word for "foolish" (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) is a strong one - it means "senseless" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-36.htm">1 Corinthians 15:36</a>). Here it has the article, "the foolish men," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those "who speak against you as evil-doers." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:13-17 A Christian conversation must be honest; which it cannot be, if there is not a just and careful discharge of all relative duties: the apostle here treats of these distinctly. Regard to those duties is the will of God, consequently, the Christian's duty, and the way to silence the base slanders of ignorant and foolish men. Christians must endeavour, in all relations, to behave aright, that they do not make their liberty a cloak or covering for any wickedness, or for the neglect of duty; but they must remember that they are servants of God.</body></html>
