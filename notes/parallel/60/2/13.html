Literally, <span class= "ital">to every human creation, i.e., </span>to every office or authority which men have established. It is not only to ordinances of directly Divine institution that we are to submit. Mind that he does not say we are to submit to every <span class= "ital">law</span> that men may pass. This passage is most directly modelled on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm" title="Let every soul be subject to the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.">Romans 13:1</a>, <span class= "ital">et seq., </span>where the reason assigned for submission is the same as that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-11.htm" title="Jesus answered, You could have no power at all against me, except it were given you from above: therefore he that delivered me to you has the greater sin.">John 19:11</a>, viz., that ultimately the authority proceeds from God Himself. Here, however, the thought is quite different. They are to submit, but not because of the original source from which the authority flows, but because of the practical consequences of not submitting. It must be done "for the Lord's" (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Jesus Christ's) "sake," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in order not to bring discredit upon His teaching, and persecution upon His Church. This difference of treatment, in the midst of so much resemblance, shows that at the date of St. Peter's letter there was much more immediate cause for laying stress on political subordination. St. Paul, writing <span class= "ital">to</span> the Roman Church, urges submission to Claudius, because the Roman Jews (among whom the Christians were reckoned) were often in trouble and expelled from the city of Rome (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-2.htm" title="And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came to them.">Acts 18:2</a>); St. Peter, writing in all probability <span class= "ital">from</span> the Roman Church, urges submission to Nero and the provincial governors because "ignorant and foolish men" were beginning to misrepresent the Christian Church as a kind of Internationalist or Socialist conspiracy.<p><span class= "bld">The king, as supreme.</span>--First division of second prudential rule: subordination political. Of course it means the emperor. The name "king," though detested in Latin, was used without scruple by the provincial Greeks to express the sovereignty of the Caesars. When he is described here as "supreme," it is not intended (as our English version would convey) to contrast his supreme power with the inferior power of the "governors;" the word is only the same which is rendered "higher" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm" title="Let every soul be subject to the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.">Romans 13:1</a>. Huther rightly says, "The emperor was in the Roman Empire not merely the highest, but actually the only ruler; all other magistrates were but the instruments by which he exercised his sway." Of course all Asia Minor, to which St. Peter was writing, was in the Roman Empire; the language would have been different had the letter been addressed to, or perhaps had it even been written from, the geographical Babylon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man.</span> The aorist passive (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) is used, as often, in a middle sense. The word for "ordinance" is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, which in classical Greek means "foundation," as of a city; but in the New Testament is used elsewhere only of the works of God, in the sense of "creation," or "a creature" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>, etc.). Hence some, as De Wette, translate the words, "to every human creature," supporting their view by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>. But on the whole this seems unlikely; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is a strange and awkward periphrasis for <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="accented">It</span> is better to understand it as meaning a human creation or foundation. Certainly "there is no power but of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>); but the form which that power assumes is a human institution. St. Peter bids his readers to submit themselves to the <span class="accented">de facto</span> form of government. <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord's sake.</span> Not from human motives, as fear of punishment; but for the Lord's sake, because "the powers that be are ordained of God," and in obeying them we obey the ordinance of God. Christians were commonly accused of insubordination, of doing "contrary to the decrees of Caesar" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-7.htm">Acts 17:7</a>); they must show by their conduct that these accusations are false, that the progress of the gospel be not hindered. <span class="cmt_word">Whether it be to the king, as supreme</span>. By "the king" is meant the Roman emperor, who was frequently so described in the Greek writers. Nero was emperor when St. Peter wrote. Christians were to obey even him, wicked tyrant as he was; for his power was given him from above, as the Lord himself had said of Pilate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-11.htm">John 19:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:13-17 A Christian conversation must be honest; which it cannot be, if there is not a just and careful discharge of all relative duties: the apostle here treats of these distinctly. Regard to those duties is the will of God, consequently, the Christian's duty, and the way to silence the base slanders of ignorant and foolish men. Christians must endeavour, in all relations, to behave aright, that they do not make their liberty a cloak or covering for any wickedness, or for the neglect of duty; but they must remember that they are servants of God.</body></html>
