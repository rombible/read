And if I say the truth, why do you not believe me?">John 8:46</a>), it did not make Him retaliate upon His accusers by counter-accusations, true though these might have been. The word here translated "revile" is the same which reappears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-9.htm" title="Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that you are thereunto called, that you should inherit a blessing.">1Peter 3:9</a> as "railing," and a sample of what it means is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-28.htm" title="Then they reviled him, and said, You are his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.">John 9:28</a>. The servants would be particularly liable to be thus abused, and instances are not wanting in the comic poets where they lose their self-control under it, and openly rate their owners in return. The "suffering," on the other hand, implies actual bodily maltreatment, "buffeting" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-20.htm" title="For what glory is it, if, when you be buffeted for your faults, you shall take it patiently? but if, when you do well, and suffer for it, you take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.">1Peter 2:20</a>) and the like, to which the slaves could not answer directly by striking in return, but would sometimes take their revenge by "threats" of what they would do--run away, or burn the house, or poison the food, or do little acts of spite. Instances of our Lord's silence or meekness under "reviling" may be seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-20.htm" title="The people answered and said, You have a devil: who goes about to kill you?">John 7:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-40.htm" title="But now you seek to kill me, a man that has told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.">John 8:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-24.htm" title="But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow does not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.">Matthew 12:24</a>, as well as in the accounts of the Passion. There are no recorded instances, until the last day of His life, of His "suffering" in the sense here intended; but the tense of the verbs "reviled," "threatened," "committed," shows that the writer was not thinking exclusively of any one occasion, but of our Lord's constant habit, though naturally there would be uppermost in St. Peter's mind the hours while he stood warming himself at Caiaphas' fire, with the denial on his lips, and saw the Messiah blindfold and buffeted. He is also thinking of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-7.htm" title="He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opens not his mouth.">Isaiah 53:7</a>.<p><span class= "bld">But committed himself.</span>--This was His only form of revenge. As the Greek does not express the grammatical object of the verb, it is better not to supply one so definite as "Himself" or "His cause," rather, "but would leave it to Him that judgeth righteously." M. Renan (<span class= "ital">Antechrist, </span>p. 117) says that this passage "requires it to be understood that the incident of Jesus praying for His murderers was not known by Peter;" and other critics have held the same view. But (1) St. Peter, as we have said, is speaking of what was the <span class= "ital">constant habit</span> of Jesus, not of what He did on the day of His crucifixion only. (2) The word does not necessarily imply any act or word of direct appeal to God to judge between His murderers and Him; on the contrary, the leading thought is that of "passing the matter over" to God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-19.htm" title="Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place to wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, said the Lord.">Romans 12:19</a>), by simply refusing to take any action in self-defence. (3) It would have been unlike the usual method of the Epistles to make direct reference to any of the minor details of our Lord's history. (4) Such a reference here would be beyond the point, for St. Peter said nothing in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-19.htm" title="For this is thank worthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.">1Peter 2:19</a> about <span class= "ital">praying</span> for the bad masters, and here he is only justifying by Christ's example the position he had laid down there.<p><span class= "bld">To him that judgeth righteously.</span>--God is described in the aspect which is most reassuring to men who are suffering unjustly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-5.htm" title="Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer:">2Thessalonians 1:5</a>). This looks back to that "consciousness of God" spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-19.htm" title="For this is thank worthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.">1Peter 2:19</a>. There is a curious various reading which is adopted by the Vulgate, though without any solid authority, and evidently a mere blunder, the interpretation of which we may leave to those who are committed to it: "He gave Himself over to him (or, to one) who judgeth unrighteously." St. Cyprian seems to have understood it of our Lord's voluntary self-surrender to Pilate.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>). The Lord again and again denounced the hypocrisy and unbelief of the Pharisees; he bade Caiaphas remember the coming judgment. But that was the language of prophetic warning, the sternness of love. He sets before them the impending punishment, that they may take heed in time and escape from the wrath to come. In the midst of his strongest invective against the sins and hollow unreality of Pharisaism there is an outburst of the deepest love, the tenderest concern (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>). But committed himself to him that judgeth righteously. The verb "committed" <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) is without an object in the original. Most commentators supply "himself," or "his cause;" others, "his sufferings;" some, as Alford, "those who inflicted them." Perhaps the last explanation is the best: he left them to God, to God's mercy, if it might be; to his judgment, if it must be. There may be a reference to his prayer, "Father, forgive them." Compare by contrast the language of Jeremiah, speaking in the spirit of the Old Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-20.htm">Jeremiah 11:20</a> and Jeremiah 20:12). There is a curious reading, entirely without the authority of existing Greek manuscripts, represented by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Tradebat judicanti se injuste</span>, as if the words were understood of the Lord's submitting himself "to one who judged unrighteously," that is, to Pilate. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:18-25 Servants in those days generally were slaves, and had heathen masters, who often used them cruelly; yet the apostle directs them to be subject to the masters placed over them by Providence, with a fear to dishonour or offend God. And not only to those pleased with reasonable service, but to the severe, and those angry without cause. The sinful misconduct of one relation, does not justify sinful behaviour in the other; the servant is bound to do his duty, though the master may be sinfully froward and perverse. But masters should be meek and gentle to their servants and inferiors. What glory or distinction could it be, for professed Christians to be patient when corrected for their faults? But if when they behaved well they were ill treated by proud and passionate heathen masters, yet bore it without peevish complaints, or purposes of revenge, and persevered in their duty, this would be acceptable to God as a distinguishing effect of his grace, and would be rewarded by him. Christ's death was designed not only for an example of patience under sufferings, but he bore our sins; he bore the punishment of them, and thereby satisfied Divine justice. Hereby he takes them away from us. The fruits of Christ's sufferings are the death of sin, and a new holy life of righteousness; for both which we have an example, and powerful motives, and ability to perform also, from the death and resurrection of Christ. And our justification; Christ was bruised and crucified as a sacrifice for our sins, and by his stripes the diseases of our souls are cured. Here is man's sin; he goes astray; it is his own act. His misery; he goes astray from the pasture, from the Shepherd, and from the flock, and so exposes himself to dangers without number. Here is the recovery by conversion; they are now returned as the effect of Divine grace. This return is, from all their errors and wanderings, to Christ. Sinners, before their conversion, are always going astray; their life is a continued error.</body></html>
