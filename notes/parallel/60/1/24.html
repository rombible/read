And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field:">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>, and varies between the Hebrew and the LXX. in the kind of way which shows that the writer was familiar with both. But the passage is by no means quoted only to support the assertion, in itself ordinary enough, that the Word of the Lord abideth for ever. It is always impossible to grasp the meaning of an Old Testament quotation in the mouth of a Hebrew without taking into account the context of the original. Nothing is commoner than to omit purposely the very words which contain the whole point of the quotation. Now these sentences in Isaiah stand in the forefront of the herald's proclamation of the return of God to Sion, always interpreted of the establishment of the Messianic kingdom. This proclamation of the Messianic kingdom comprises words which St. Peter has purposely omitted, and they contain the point of the quotation. The omitted words are, "the Spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it: surely <span class= "ital">the people"</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Israel--"is grass." Immediately before our quotation went the words, "the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and <span class= "ital">all flesh</span> shall see it together;" statements which so shocked the LXX. translator that he entirely omitted <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-7.htm" title="That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be found to praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:">1Peter 1:7</a>, and changed the previous verse so as to make <span class= "ital">some</span> difference between Jew and Gentile (as Godet points out on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-6.htm" title="And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.">Luke 3:6</a>), into "the glory of the Lord shall be revealed." <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to Israel, "and all flesh shall see <span class= "ital">the salvation</span> of God." The comment of Bishop Lowth on the original passage will well bring out what St. Peter means here: "What is the import of [the proclamation]? that the people, the flesh, is of a vain temporary nature; that all its glory fadeth, and is soon gone; but that the Word of God endureth for ever. What is this but a plain opposition of the flesh to the Spirit; of the carnal Israel to the spiritual; of the temporary Mosaic economy to the eternal Christian dispensation?" Here, then, St. Peter is quoting one of the greatest of Messianic prophecies; and his Hebrew readers would at once understand the Hebrew method of the quotation, and see that he was calling attention to the absolute equality of Jew and Gentile there proclaimed. Generation of the corruptible seed, physical descent from Abraham, was "the glory of the flesh" (observe that according to the best text St. Peter does <span class= "ital">not</span> follow the LXX., and insert "of man," but follows the Hebrew, and says "all the glory thereof," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of the flesh). On this "the <span class= "ital">Spirit</span> of the Lord" had breathed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-30.htm" title="You send forth your spirit, they are created: and you renew the face of the earth.">Psalm 104:30</a>); and the merely fleshly glory had withered like grass. But "the word of our God," which, mark well, St. Peter purposely changes into "the Word of the Lord," <span class= "ital">i.e., of Jesus Christ, </span>incidentally showing his Hebrew readers that he believed Jesus Christ to <span class= "ital">be </span>"our God"--this "abideth for ever." The engendering by <span class= "ital">this</span> is imperishable, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>involves a privilege which is not, like that of the Jewish blood, transitory: it will never become a matter of indifference whether we have been engendered with this, as is the case now (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-15.htm" title="For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.">Galatians 6:15</a>) with regard to the "corruptible seed;" no further revelation will ever level up the unregenerate to be the equals of the regenerate. And in this regeneration "all flesh" share alike. The teaching of the Baptist, who fulfilled this prophecy, is here again apparent. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-9.htm" title="And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.">Matthew 3:9</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass.</span> The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away. St. Peter quotes <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>, in illustration of his assertion that the Word of God abideth forever. The quotation is from the Septuagint. St. Peter follows that version in omitting part of ver. 7; but he slightly varies the words, writing (according to the most ancient manuscripts), "all the glory thereof," instead of "all the glory of man;" and in the next verse, "the Word of the <span class="accented">Lord</span>," instead of "the Word of our God." The first variation shows an acquaintance with the original Hebrew. St. James refers to the same passage from Isaiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-10.htm">James 1:10, 11</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:17-25 Holy confidence in God as a Father, and awful fear of him as a Judge, agree together; and to regard God always as a Judge, makes him dear to us as a Father. If believers do evil, God will visit them with corrections. Then, let Christians not doubt God's faithfulness to his promises, nor give way to enslaving dread of his wrath, but let them reverence his holiness. The fearless professor is defenceless, and Satan takes him captive at his will; the desponding professor has no heart to avail himself of his advantages, and is easily brought to surrender. The price paid for man's redemption was the precious blood of Christ. Not only openly wicked, but unprofitable conversation is highly dangerous, though it may plead custom. It is folly to resolve, I will live and die in such a way, because my forefathers did so. God had purposes of special favour toward his people, long before he made manifest such grace unto them. But the clearness of light, the supports of faith, the power of ordinances, are all much greater since Christ came upon earth, than they were before. The comfort is, that being by faith made one with Christ, his present glory is an assurance that where he is we shall be also, Joh 14:3. The soul must be purified, before it can give up its own desires and indulgences. And the word of God planted in the heart by the Holy Ghost, is a means of spiritual life, stirring up to our duty, working a total change in the dispositions and affections of the soul, till it brings to eternal life. In contrast with the excellence of the renewed spiritual man, as born again, observe the vanity of the natural man. In his life, and in his fall, he is like grass, the flower of grass, which soon withers and dies away. We should hear, and thus receive and love, the holy, living word, and rather hazard all than lose it; and we must banish all other things from the place due to it. We should lodge it in our hearts as our only treasures here, and the certain pledge of the treasure of glory laid up for believers in heaven.</body></html>
