The purpose of God's providence in sending the griefs is "that the trial of your faith might be found unto praise." The word "trial" here does not mean exactly the same as in the passage of St. James; in that passage it signifies the active testing of faith, <span class= "ital">here</span> it has rather the meaning of the cognate word translated "assurance" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-4.htm" title="And patience, experience; and experience, hope:">Romans 5:4</a>, "proof" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-9.htm" title="For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether you be obedient in all things.">2Corinthians 2:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-22.htm" title="But you know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he has served with me in the gospel.">Philippians 2:22</a>, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the attested worth, the genuine character. This seems necessitated by the comparison of the <span class= "ital">trial</span> with the <span class= "ital">gold</span> itself, as we shall see. You cannot compare an act or process with gold, but you can compare "the genuine character" brought out by the process properly enough. Besides, that which you wish to "praise" at Christ's coming is not the process by which the faith was proved, but the worth of the faith itself. "Faith" seems to mean the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-5.htm" title="Who are kept by the power of God through faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.">1Peter 1:5</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Being much more precious than of gold.</span>--There is no reason, or indeed any grammatical right, to insert the "of." It should be, <span class= "ital">more exceedingly valuable than gold.</span> He does not say "your <span class= "ital">faith</span> is more valuable than gold," but "your faith's <span class= "ital">genuineness</span> is more valuable than gold." It is worth anything to establish the <span class= "ital">true character</span> of your faith; it would be a most serious loss to leave a chance of an imputation upon your Christianity.<p><span class= "bld">That perisheth, though it be tried with fire.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">which is a thing that perisheth, and yet is tried through fire.</span> The argument is this. Gold is a perishable thing, and comes to an end with the rest of the world, or is worn away with handling and is lost; and yet men take great pains to test it and show that it contains no dross, and do so by means of fire. How much more may we expect a fiery trial (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-12.htm" title="Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you:">1Peter 4:12</a>) to test the character of our belief in the unseen Christ, when that belief is never to come to an end (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-13.htm" title="And now stays faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.">1Corinthians 13:13</a>), and on its freedom from alloy everything depends!<p><span class= "bld">Might be found.</span>--That is, <span class= "ital">might clearly prove to be.</span> The time will come when the gold will be <span class= "ital">inspected, </span>and the Judge, and all the spectators, will "find" that the testing was sufficient and the character satisfactory. "Found <span class= "ital">unto</span> praise," or, <span class= "ital">found for a praise, </span>is a Hebraism, meaning "found to be a matter of praise." St. Peter is fond of heaping up words of like signification. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-4.htm" title="To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for you,">1Peter 1:4</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-10.htm" title="But the God of all grace, who has called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that you have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you.">1Peter 5:10</a>.) "Praise" is the <span class= "ital">language</span> that will be used about these men's faith; "honour," the <span class= "ital">rank</span> in which they will be placed; "glory," the fervent <span class= "ital">admiration</span> accorded to them: the three words correspond to the regions of word, act, and feeling.<p><span class= "bld">At the appearing of Jesus Christ.</span>--<span class= "ital">Revelation</span> would have been better, as the word in the Greek is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-5.htm" title="Who are kept by the power of God through faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.">1Peter 1:5</a>. This gives the date at which the trial will have done its work: it is the same as the "last time" when the "deliverance" will be revealed. Remember that all through the afflictions and assaults the men are "being guarded by the power of God." There are several words and thoughts in this whole passage which would suggest that Daniel 12 was before the mind of the Apostle more or less consciously.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That the trial of your faith.</span> The words of ver. 6, "if need be," point to the purpose and end of the temptations. St. Peter proceeds to develop his meaning. The word rendered "trial" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) means rather "test or proof;" it is explained by Dionysius of Halicarnassus ('Rhet.,' I1) as that at which, when one looks, he is able to form a judgment. Cremer says it is "not only the means of proof itself, e.g. the touchstone, but also the trace of the metal left thereon. Hence here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-3.htm">James 1:3</a> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> is the result of the contact of faith with temptations, that in virtue of which faith is recognized as genuine - the verification of faith." Dr. Heft ('Notes on Select Readings') prefers the reading <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which is given by two of the better cursives. He says, "<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is the instrument of trial, not even the process of trial, much less the thing fried; while it is only the thing tried that can be compared, as here, to gold refined in the fire." Compare the use of the cognate word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-9.htm">2 Corinthians 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-4.htm">Romans 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-22.htm">Philippians 2:22</a>. Being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">more precious than gold</span>. Gold is the most precious of metals, faith is more precious far; the proof of faith is more momentous beyond all comparison than the proof of gold. Gold perishes; "Consumitur annulus usu," says the poet; "Aurum cummundo perit," says Bengel; but "Now abideth faith, hope, charity," says the apostle. Gold is tried with fire; as by the purifying fire gold is purged of dross (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>), so by the refining fire of temptations the faithful are cleansed from pride and self-reliance and the pollutions of sin. Might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ; "might be found" at the judgment, in the searching investigation of the great day. <span class="accented">-Praise</span>; in words, "Well (lone, good and faithful servant." <span class="accented">He, our</span>; in the distinctions granted to the faithful - the crown of righteousness, the white robe, the palm. <span class="accented">Glory</span>; the glory which was Christ's before the world was, which he giveth to his chosen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-22.htm">John 17:22</a>). <span class="accented">At the appearing</span>; rather, <span class="accented">revelation</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Now we see him only by faith</span>; then his elect shall see him as he is - the veil will be withdrawn (see ver. 5). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-9 This epistle is addressed to believers in general, who are strangers in every city or country where they live, and are scattered through the nations. These are to ascribe their salvation to the electing love of the Father, the redemption of the Son, and the sanctification of the Holy Ghost; and so to give glory to one God in three Persons, into whose name they had been baptized. Hope, in the world's phrase, refers only to an uncertain good, for all worldly hopes are tottering, built upon sand, and the worldling's hopes of heaven are blind and groundless conjectures. But the hope of the sons of the living God is a living hope; not only as to its object, but as to its effect also. It enlivens and comforts in all distresses, enables to meet and get over all difficulties. Mercy is the spring of all this; yea, great mercy and manifold mercy. And this well-grounded hope of salvation, is an active and living principle of obedience in the soul of the believer. The matter of a Christian's joy, is the remembrance of the happiness laid up for him. It is incorruptible, it cannot come to nothing, it is an estate that cannot be spent. Also undefiled; this signifies its purity and perfection. And it fadeth not; is not sometimes more or less pleasant, but ever the same, still like itself. All possessions here are stained with defects and failings; still something is wanting: fair houses have sad cares flying about the gilded and ceiled roofs; soft beds and full tables, are often with sick bodies and uneasy stomachs. All possessions are stained with sin, either in getting or in using them. How ready we are to turn the things we possess into occasions and instruments of sin, and to think there is no liberty or delight in their use, without abusing them! Worldly possessions are uncertain and soon pass away, like the flowers and plants of the field. That must be of the greatest worth, which is laid up in the highest and best place, in heaven. Happy are those whose hearts the Holy Spirit sets on this inheritance. God not only gives his people grace, but preserves them unto glory. Every believer has always something wherein he may greatly rejoice; it should show itself in the countenance and conduct. The Lord does not willingly afflict, yet his wise love often appoints sharp trials, to show his people their hearts, and to do them good at the latter end. Gold does not increase by trial in the fire, it becomes less; but faith is made firm, and multiplied, by troubles and afflictions. Gold must perish at last, and can only purchase perishing things, while the trial of faith will be found to praise, and honour, and glory. Let this reconcile us to present afflictions. Seek then to believe Christ's excellence in himself, and his love to us; this will kindle such a fire in the heart as will make it rise up in a sacrifice of love to him. And the glory of God and our own happiness are so united, that if we sincerely seek the one now, we shall attain the other when the soul shall no more be subject to evil. The certainty of this hope is as if believers had already received it.</body></html>
