That is to say, the revelation here spoken of is not a special revelation sent in answer to their laborious musings, but rather the very thing which occasioned them; the perplexity consisted in feeling that God had a further meaning for their words. And the exact limits of the revelation are mentioned: they were shown that they spoke for the benefit of futurity, and no more! What a "trial of faith!" What a sublime disappointment! (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-40.htm" title="God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.">Hebrews 11:40</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Unto us.</span>--Far the better reading is, <span class= "ital">unto you.</span> It is a distinct characteristic of this Epistle, that "we," "us," "our," are so seldom used (in the best text) where they might have been expected. Where St. Paul throws in his own sympathy, and puts himself on a footing with those whom he addresses, St. Peter utters his lofty pastoral from above. There are but four places in the Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,">1Peter 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm" title="Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.">1Peter 2:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1Peter 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-17.htm" title="For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?">1Peter 4:17</a>) where he associates himself thus with his brethren, and one of those (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm" title="Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.">1Peter 2:24</a>) is really a quotation, and one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1Peter 3:18</a>) at best a very doubtful reading. The same tendency may be observed in his speech (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-7.htm" title="And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said to them, Men and brothers, you know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.">Acts 15:7</a>), where the right reading is "made choice among <span class= "ital">you.</span>"<p><span class= "bld">The things.</span>--In the original simply <span class= "ital">them;</span> so that a semicolon might better follow than a comma, and <span class= "ital">which things</span> be put instead of "which." The most natural thing is to suppose that the pronoun represents the preceding "sufferings in reserve for Messiah and the glories after." In what sense, then, could the prophets "minister," either to themselves or to us, the sufferings and glories of Messiah? The word is one which signifies a servant bringing to his master the things which he needs--commonly used (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-2.htm" title="There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.">John 12:2</a>) of serving up a meal; and the prophets are said to <span class= "ital">serve</span> the Messianic sufferings and glories to us, to wait upon us with them, to present them to our use and study and comfort. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-10.htm" title="As every man has received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.">1Peter 4:10</a>.) When it says, however, that they ministered them "<span class= "ital">not</span> to themselves but to us," we must not suppose that they derived <span class= "ital">no</span> comfort from their predictions (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-56.htm" title="Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.">John 8:56</a>): the "not" must be taken in the same sense as in "I will have mercy and not sacrifice" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-13.htm" title="But go you and learn what that means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.">Matthew 9:13</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Which are now reported unto you.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">which things</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the gospel story) <span class= "ital">now</span> (in contrast with the days of the prophets) <span class= "ital">were</span> (not "are") <span class= "ital">openly declared to you</span> (in all their details, in contrast with the dim and vague way in which they were seen before). Such is the force of this compound Greek verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-25.htm" title="The woman said to him, I know that Messias comes, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.">John 4:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-18.htm" title="And many that believed came, and confessed, and showed their deeds.">Acts 19:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-20.htm" title="And how I kept back nothing that was profitable to you, but have showed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house,">Acts 20:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-27.htm" title="For I have not shunned to declare to you all the counsel of God.">Acts 20:27</a>.<p><span class= "bld">By them that have preached.</span>--More correctly, <span class= "ital">through those who preached;</span> the difference being that St. Peter is referring to the <span class= "ital">first</span> bearers of the gospel to those parts, not to <span class= "ital">all</span> who from that time to the date of the Letter had preached. This is a point well worth noticing. The phrase seems to show that St. Peter himself was not of the number. Perhaps half the churches which received the Letter looked to St. Paul as their founder. (See last Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1Peter 1:1</a>.) Here, then, we find the Rock-Apostle authoritatively setting his seal to the teaching of his junior colleague, just as he does in the Second Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-15.htm" title="But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:">1Peter 3:15</a>). It seems to imply that these Jewish Christians were beginning to feel a reaction from St. Paul's evangelical teaching<span class= "ital">;</span> and the Apostle of the Circumcision is called in to enforce what the Apostle of the Uncircumcision had taught. The revolt of the Hebrew Christians in <span class= "ital">Asia</span> from evangelical teaching appears again at a still later period (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-9.htm" title="I know your works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but you are rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.">Revelation 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-9.htm" title="Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.">Revelation 3:9</a>). It was, perhaps, only with <span class= "ital">Jewish</span> Christians that such an appeal from St. Paul to St. Peter would be made, and need not imply superiority throughout the whole Church. St. Peter's perfect concurrence with St. Paul here is a sufficient contradiction to the Tubingen theory of their irreconcilable divergence--only the Tubingen school reject the Epistle on the ground that it makes the Apostles too harmonious!<p><span class= "bld">With the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven.</span>--The magnificent phrase seems meant to contrast the <span class= "ital">full</span> effusion of the Spirit now, with His limited working in the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-11.htm" title="Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.">1Peter 1:11</a>). But it contains more teaching than this. The tense of the participle "sent" is such as might without violence be rendered "sent once and for ever," "sent in a moment." Now, remember that almost undoubtedly some of the recipients of the Letter (see last Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1Peter 1:1</a>) were eye-witnesses of His being "sent" to St. Peter and the rest on the Day of Pentecost. St. Peter, then, here claims for St. Paul (and St. Silas perhaps) the very same inspiration with which himself was furnished. And as here he claims full inspiration for St. Paul's <span class= "ital">preaching, </span>so he does afterwards for his <span class= "ital">writing</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-15.htm" title="And account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given to him has written to you;">2Peter 3:15</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Which things the angels.</span>--The "which things" here is grammatically parallel to the "which things" of the last sentence, and therefore would mean "the sufferings of Messiah and the glories after." But logically we have to go back to the beginning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-10.htm" title="Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you:">1Peter 1:10</a> : "Do I say that <span class= "ital">prophets, </span>who had the mysteries of our redemption on their lips, yet pored in vain to catch the detailed meaning which you catch? Nay; angels (not "<span class= "ital">the</span> angels"), who were present at every detail, and bore an active part in it all (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-20.htm" title="But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, you son of David, fear not to take to you Mary your wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.">Matthew 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-11.htm" title="Then the devil leaves him, and, behold, angels came and ministered to him.">Matthew 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-2.htm" title="And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat on it.">Matthew 28:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-26.htm" title="And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,">Luke 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-9.htm" title="And, see, the angel of the Lord came on them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.">Luke 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-43.htm" title="And there appeared an angel to him from heaven, strengthening him.">Luke 22:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-51.htm" title="And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.">John 1:51</a>),--<span class= "ital">angels, </span>of whom He 'was <span class= "ital">seen</span>' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1Timothy 3:16</a>),--covet now to exchange places with you that they may gaze into the mystery." The word which has here shrunk into our word "to look into," means really, <span class= "ital">to bend aside to see.</span> In its literal sense it occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-5.htm" title="And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.">John 20:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-11.htm" title="But Mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulcher,">John 20:11</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-12.htm" title="Then arose Peter, and ran to the sepulcher; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.">Luke 24:12</a> (a verse not found in the best text), of people standing at the side of the cave so as not to get in their own light, and stooping sideways to peer in. Metaphorically it is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-25.htm" title="But whoever looks into the perfect law of liberty, and continues therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.">James 1:25</a>, where see Note. It seems to mean a strained attention to something which has caught your eye somewhat out of your usual line of sight. Here then, the intention is to show that we are in a better position to understand the mysteries of redemption, not only than prophets, but also than angels; and they covet to stoop from their own point of view to ours. And why so? Not because of the inherent mysteriousness of the union of the two natures in Christ, for of that they are as intelligent as we, or more so; but because they are incapable of fully understanding <span class= "ital">human</span> nature, flesh and blood, with its temptations and pains, its need of a Saviour. In Francia's great picture, the two angels kneel by weeping Mary and dead Christ without a trace of grief on their countenances. The Son of God Himself only became capable of entering into our infirmities through becoming flesh, and experiencing the same (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-16.htm" title="For truly he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.">Hebrews 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-18.htm" title="For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted.">Hebrews 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-15.htm" title="For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.">Hebrews 4:15</a>). Several passages show us that the tragedy of human history is by no means enacted only for the benefit of the actors, but as a lesson (possibly, as Archbishop Whately pointed out, only a single <span class= "ital">illustration</span> out of many in one lesson) for the instruction of unfallen spirits (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-9.htm" title="For I think that God has set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.">1Corinthians 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1Timothy 3:16</a>). Our present passage has impressed itself on Christian lyrics as much, perhaps, as any in the New Testament. Charles Wesley well strikes the meaning in many of his poems: as--<p>"Ask the Father's Wisdom how,<p>Him that did the means ordain;<p>Angels round our altars <span class= "ital">bow</span><p>To search it out in vain;"<p>or again--<p>"Angels in <span class= "ital">fixt amazement</span><p>Around our altars hover,<p>With <span class= "ital">eager gaze</span> adore the grace<p>Of our Eternal Lover."<p>Though very possibly the divine intention of the cherubim over the mercy-seat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-20.htm" title="And the cherubim shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubim be.">Exodus 25:20</a>) may have been to symbolise that which is here said, yet it is not to be thought that St. Peter was consciously thinking of the symbol.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things.</span> It was revealed to them, whether in answer to their search as in the case of Daniel, or as part of the original revelation made to them, that the vision was for many days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-14.htm">Daniel 10:14</a>).

The prophets, doubtless, like Abraham, rejoiced to see the day of Christ; they saw it by faith, and were glad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-56.htm">John 8:56</a>); but they saw it in the far distance; they desired to see and hear what the apostles saw and heard, but the time was not yet (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-16.htm">Matthew 13:16, 17</a>). <span class="accented">They did minister the things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they were made the instruments of revealing them; they presented them to the devout for their spiritual food and support. Which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost lent down from heaven; rather, <span class="accented">which were now reported to you through them that preached the gospel unto you</span> (literally, <span class="accented">evangelized you</span>) <span class="accented">by the Holy Ghost</span>. St. Peter claims for those who evangelized Asia Minor (St. Paul and his companions) the same authority which was possessed by the ancient prophets; they preached as fulfilled the great truths which the prophets foretold as future. The Spirit of Christ was in the prophets; the same Spirit worked and preached through the apostles; nay, he dwelt in them in fuller measure, for he had been sent down from heaven on the great Day of Pentecost, and it was by his aid that the apostles and evangelists preached. Which things the angels desire to look into. The salvation which God's elect receive is so full of glory and mysterious beauty, that not only did the prophets of old search diligently, but even an gels (there is no article) desire to look into it. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means "to stoop sideways;" it is used of persons standing outside a place who stoop in order to look in. "The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span> of the verb," says Huther, "indicates that the angels stand outside the work of redemption, inasmuch as it is not for them, but for man (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-16.htm">Hebrews 2:16</a>)." The same verb occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-5.htm">John 20:5, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-12.htm">Luke 24:12</a>, in which last place it is used of Peter himself, when he stooped to look into the empty sepulcher on the morning of the Lord's resurrection. St. Paul has a similar thought in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10</a>, "To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the Church the manifold wisdom of God." The attitude of the golden cherubim, whose wings covered the mercy-seat and whose faces were toward it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>), seems to imply the same rapt, reverent attention. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-12 Jesus Christ was the main subject of the prophets' studies. Their inquiry into the sufferings of Christ and the glories that should follow, would lead to a view of the whole gospel, the sum whereof is, That Christ Jesus was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification. God is pleased to answer our necessities rather than our requests. The doctrine of the prophets, and that of the apostles, exactly agree, as coming from the same Spirit of God. The gospel is the ministration of the Spirit; its success depends upon his operation and blessing. Let us then search diligently those Scriptures which contain the doctrines of salvation.</body></html>
