On this last point see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm" title="But as touching brotherly love you need not that I write to you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another.">1Thessalonians 4:9</a>. Perhaps the literal "in the obedience of the truth" (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the Christian gospel) does not exactly coincide with "obeying the truth," as implying rather "the obedience (to God) which the truth (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the knowledge of the truth) demands." Truth has a claim, not only to be accepted intellectually, as truth, but to alter moral conduct in accordance (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-17.htm" title="Sanctify them through your truth: your word is truth.">John 17:17</a>): a doctrine which lies at the bottom of the Socratic maxim, "Virtue is knowledge." That Socratic maxim, however, does not sufficiently take into account the inertness of the will to act on principle; and no doubt it was under some such instinct that some copyist first added as a gloss the words (not found in the original text) "through the Spirit." The first effect of such knowledge of the truth, under the Spirit's influence, is to <span class= "ital">"</span>purify" the soul of selfish aims, and to give it that "altruism" (as they call it now), or desire for the benefit of the community rather than self, which is here described as "love of the brethren." (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-13.htm" title="To the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.">1Thessalonians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm" title="That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.">1Thessalonians 4:6</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Unfeigned love of the brethren.</span>--The epithet "unfeigned," in itself, would suggest that St. Peter was uneasy about the depth of their brotherly kindness. And the brotherly kindness is here, as usual, attachment to other members of the Church, special point being added to the word here because of the notion of regeneration running through the whole passage. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-14.htm" title="As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:">1Peter 1:14</a>.) Is it not possible that some coolness had arisen between the Jewish and Gentile members of the Church, and that St. Peter finds it necessary to remind the former that they are truly brethren, sons of one Father, and that they ought not only unaffectedly to have done with all jealousy of the Gentile members, but to be far beyond that, loving one another "from the heart (the word 'pure' is not part of the original text, and interrupts the run of the sentence) strenuously?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seeing ye have purified your souls</span>; literally, <span class="accented">having purified</span>. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> is used of ceremonial purification in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-55.htm">John 11:55</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-24.htm">Acts 21:24, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-18.htm">Acts 24:18</a>. St. James and St. John, in their Epistles, give it the spiritual sense in which St. Peter uses it here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-3.htm">1 John 3:3</a>). In this sense it implies consecration to God's service, and an inward cleansing of the heart from all that defiles - from sensual desires, from hypocrisy, from selfishness. The tense shows that this inward purification must precede the love to which the apostle exhorts us; there can be no true love in an unclean heart. In obeying the truth through the Spirit; literally, <span class="accented">in the obedience of the truth</span>. Obedience is the condition of purification. God's people are elect unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. While they walk in the path of obedience they are walking in the light, the light of truth, the light of God's presence, and then the blood of Jesus Christ is cleansing them from all sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>). The genitive (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) seems to be objective, "obedience to the truth," rather than obedience wrought by the truth. The truth is God's truth, the truth revealed in his Holy Word. So the Lord himself said, "Sanctify them through thy truth; thy Word is truth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>). The words, "through the Spirit," are not found in the best manuscripts; they may be a gloss, but a true one. <span class="cmt_word">Unto unfeigned love of the brethren</span>. St. Peter had not forgotten the new commandment, "That ye love one another, as I have loved you, that ye also love one another." The word rendered "love of the brethren" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is scarcely found except in Christian writings. St. Peter uses it again in his Second Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-7.htm">2 Peter 1:7</a>), and also St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-10.htm">Romans 12:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:9</a>). It must be unfeigned, without hypocrisy, not in word, but in deed and in truth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>). Our hearts must be purified in the obedience of the truth before that unfeigned love can dwell in them (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-5.htm">1 Timothy 1:5</a>, which is an exact parallel). See that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently; literally, <span class="accented">love one another from the heart</span>. The word "pure" is omitted in two of the most ancient manuscripts; it may be a gloss, but it is most true and suitable. Christian love must he from the heart, true and pure. The word rendered "fervently" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>) means, literally, "intensely," with all the energies strained to the utmost. It is interesting to observe that the only other place where the adverb occurs is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-5.htm">Acts 12:5</a> (according to the reading of the most ancient manuscripts), where it is used of the prayer offered up for St. Peter himself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:17-25 Holy confidence in God as a Father, and awful fear of him as a Judge, agree together; and to regard God always as a Judge, makes him dear to us as a Father. If believers do evil, God will visit them with corrections. Then, let Christians not doubt God's faithfulness to his promises, nor give way to enslaving dread of his wrath, but let them reverence his holiness. The fearless professor is defenceless, and Satan takes him captive at his will; the desponding professor has no heart to avail himself of his advantages, and is easily brought to surrender. The price paid for man's redemption was the precious blood of Christ. Not only openly wicked, but unprofitable conversation is highly dangerous, though it may plead custom. It is folly to resolve, I will live and die in such a way, because my forefathers did so. God had purposes of special favour toward his people, long before he made manifest such grace unto them. But the clearness of light, the supports of faith, the power of ordinances, are all much greater since Christ came upon earth, than they were before. The comfort is, that being by faith made one with Christ, his present glory is an assurance that where he is we shall be also, Joh 14:3. The soul must be purified, before it can give up its own desires and indulgences. And the word of God planted in the heart by the Holy Ghost, is a means of spiritual life, stirring up to our duty, working a total change in the dispositions and affections of the soul, till it brings to eternal life. In contrast with the excellence of the renewed spiritual man, as born again, observe the vanity of the natural man. In his life, and in his fall, he is like grass, the flower of grass, which soon withers and dies away. We should hear, and thus receive and love, the holy, living word, and rather hazard all than lose it; and we must banish all other things from the place due to it. We should lodge it in our hearts as our only treasures here, and the certain pledge of the treasure of glory laid up for believers in heaven.</body></html>
