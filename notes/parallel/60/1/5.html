It is through such trustful fidelity that we are guarded.<p><span class= "bld">Unto salvation</span>.--These words "unto" arise like point beyond point in the endless vista. "Begotten <span class= "ital">unto</span> an inheritance, which hath bee reserved unto you, who are kept safe unto a deliverance." This Salvation, spoken of again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-9.htm" title="Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.">1Peter 1:9</a>, must not be taken in the bald sense of salvation from damnation. Indeed, the thought of the perdition of the lost does not enter at all into the passage. The salvation, or deliverance, is primarily a deliverance from all the trials and persecutions, struggles and temptations of this life--an emergence into the state of peace and rest, as we can see from the verses that follow.<p><span class= "bld">Ready to be revealed in the last time.</span>--How such an assurance helps to form the very "faith" through which the treasure is secured! That perfect state of peace, that heavenly inheritance, is not something to be prepared hereafter, but <span class= "ital">there it is.</span> If only our eyes were opened, we should already see it. It is all ready, only waiting for the great moment. The tense of the word "revealed" implies the suddenness of the unveiling. It will be but the work of an instant to put aside the curtain and show the inheritance which has been kept hidden so long behind it. This, however, will not take place till the <span class= "ital">exact</span> period (so the word for "time" suggests; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-6.htm" title="And now you know what withholds that he might be revealed in his time.">2Thessalonians 2:6</a>), and that period will be the last of the world's history. For such teaching the Hebrews would be well prepared by the Old Testament--for instance, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-9.htm" title="And he said, Go your way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.">Daniel 12:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-13.htm" title="But go you your way till the end be: for you shall rest, and stand in your lot at the end of the days.">Daniel 12:13</a>--and it was the earliest kind teaching culled for converts out of the "oracles of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm" title="For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.">Hebrews 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-2.htm" title="Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.">Hebrews 6:2</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Who are kept by the power of God. "Hereditas servata est," says Bengel, "heredes custodiuntur?" The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, is a military word. "The governor under Areas the king <span class="accented">kept</span> [guarded] the city of the Damascenes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-32.htm">2 Corinthians 11:32</a>); the peace of God shall <span class="accented">keep</span> ("guard." <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>) the hearts of those who trust in him, - they are guarded by a heavenly host; "The angel of the Lord encampeth around them that fear him;" they are guarded by, or rather, according to the exact rendering, <span class="accented">in</span> the power of God. His power is all around them; it is the sphere in which they live and move; no harm can reach them in that all-embracing shelter. Through faith. Faith, the evidence of things not seen, realizes the presence of the heavenly guard, and gives courage and confidence to the Christian when assailed by temptations and dangers; the servant of Elisha feared no more the hosts of Syria, when he saw the mountain full of chariots and horses of fire round about his master. Faith is the instrument by means of which we grasp the Divine strength, so that it is made perfect in our weakness. Unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. By "salvation" St. Peter means not merely present deliverance from sin, but everlasting life, the joy of our Lord, the deep, full blessedness of his elect in heaven. Eye hath not seen it yet, it hath not entered into the heart of man. But it is ready to be revealed; the veil which now hides it from us will be withdrawn in the last time, when the last page of this world's history shall have been written, when the number of the elect shall be accomplished, and the eternal purpose of God shall have been fulfilled. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-9 This epistle is addressed to believers in general, who are strangers in every city or country where they live, and are scattered through the nations. These are to ascribe their salvation to the electing love of the Father, the redemption of the Son, and the sanctification of the Holy Ghost; and so to give glory to one God in three Persons, into whose name they had been baptized. Hope, in the world's phrase, refers only to an uncertain good, for all worldly hopes are tottering, built upon sand, and the worldling's hopes of heaven are blind and groundless conjectures. But the hope of the sons of the living God is a living hope; not only as to its object, but as to its effect also. It enlivens and comforts in all distresses, enables to meet and get over all difficulties. Mercy is the spring of all this; yea, great mercy and manifold mercy. And this well-grounded hope of salvation, is an active and living principle of obedience in the soul of the believer. The matter of a Christian's joy, is the remembrance of the happiness laid up for him. It is incorruptible, it cannot come to nothing, it is an estate that cannot be spent. Also undefiled; this signifies its purity and perfection. And it fadeth not; is not sometimes more or less pleasant, but ever the same, still like itself. All possessions here are stained with defects and failings; still something is wanting: fair houses have sad cares flying about the gilded and ceiled roofs; soft beds and full tables, are often with sick bodies and uneasy stomachs. All possessions are stained with sin, either in getting or in using them. How ready we are to turn the things we possess into occasions and instruments of sin, and to think there is no liberty or delight in their use, without abusing them! Worldly possessions are uncertain and soon pass away, like the flowers and plants of the field. That must be of the greatest worth, which is laid up in the highest and best place, in heaven. Happy are those whose hearts the Holy Spirit sets on this inheritance. God not only gives his people grace, but preserves them unto glory. Every believer has always something wherein he may greatly rejoice; it should show itself in the countenance and conduct. The Lord does not willingly afflict, yet his wise love often appoints sharp trials, to show his people their hearts, and to do them good at the latter end. Gold does not increase by trial in the fire, it becomes less; but faith is made firm, and multiplied, by troubles and afflictions. Gold must perish at last, and can only purchase perishing things, while the trial of faith will be found to praise, and honour, and glory. Let this reconcile us to present afflictions. Seek then to believe Christ's excellence in himself, and his love to us; this will kindle such a fire in the heart as will make it rise up in a sacrifice of love to him. And the glory of God and our own happiness are so united, that if we sincerely seek the one now, we shall attain the other when the soul shall no more be subject to evil. The certainty of this hope is as if believers had already received it.</body></html>
