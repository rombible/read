What exact kind of action St. Peter meant them here to prepare for we need not inquire. A "mind," rather than "soul" or "heart," seems to bespeak <span class= "ital">practical intelligence.</span> Thus when the <span class= "ital">Galatians, </span>too, began to fall from evangelical to Judaic religion St. Paul calls them "senseless" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-1.htm" title="O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth, crucified among you?">Galatians 3:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Be sober.</span>--Not in the literal sense, but with the same notion of alertness as in "gird up"; sobriety and wakefulness are often combined (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm" title="Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour:">1Peter 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm" title="Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.">1Thessalonians 5:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Hope to the end</span>.--Literally, <span class= "ital">hope perfectly, </span>or, <span class= "ital">thoroughly, </span>or, <span class= "ital">with completeness. "</span>Indeed this hope," says Leighton, "is perfect in <span class= "ital">continuance, </span>it is a <span class= "ital">hope unto the end, </span>because it is perfect in its <span class= "ital">nature."</span> The chief thought, however, is that the hope should not be half-hearted, dispirited. St. Peter brings us back to what he began with, that ours is a <span class= "ital">living</span> hope. The exhortation is exactly of the same nature as that which pervades the Epistle to the Hebrews (see, for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm" title="But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.">Hebrews 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-14.htm" title="For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end;">Hebrews 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-11.htm" title="And we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope to the end:">Hebrews 6:11</a>), and for the same reason--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>that spiritual sloth, combined with fear of man, was beginning to turn these Jewish Christians back to dead works. "Hope on," in these passages, is tantamount to "remain Christians."<p><span class= "bld">For the grace</span>.--Not exactly" hope <span class= "ital">for</span> the grace," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>expect confidently that it will come: rather, "hope <span class= "ital">upon</span> the grace," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-5.htm" title="Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusts in God, and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.">1Timothy 5:5</a>, the only other place where the same construction is used, and where it is rendered "<span class= "ital">trusteth in</span> God." Here, therefore, it is, "confidently hope (for salvation, glory, &c.) on the strength of the grace." The grace is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-10.htm" title="Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you:">1Peter 1:10</a>.<p><span class= "bld">That is to be brought.</span>--"If we will render it strictly, it is, <span class= "ital">That is a-bringing to you.</span> That blessedness, that consummation of grace, the saints are hastening forward to, walking on in their way, wheresoever it lies indifferently, through honour and dishonour, through evil report and good report. And as they are hastening to it, it is hastening to them in the course of time; every day brings it nearer to them than before; and notwithstanding all difficulties and dangers in the way, they that have their eye and their hopes upon it shall arrive at it, and it shall be brought safe to their hand; all the malice of men and devils shall not be able to cut them short of this <span class= "ital">grace that is a-bringing</span> to them against the revelation of Jesus Christ" (Leighton). On the tense, see also Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm" title="And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.">1Thessalonians 1:10</a>. Notice also that it is now the <span class= "ital">personal Name, </span>not the official title. St. Peter is enforcing the gospel as we know it; we no longer "search unto <span class= "ital">whom"</span> the title of the Messiah belongs.<p>(13-4: 6)<span class= "bld"> EXHORTATION TO KEEP A PURE CONSCIENCE.</span>--It is the only charm against persecution. It is like Christ to suffer with a good conscience; and He had His reward for it, in bringing us, and even the spirits of men who had died impenitent, to God thereby. It is the very meaning of the baptism by which He saves us. To feel its beauty and safety, we have but to consider the ugliness and danger of our former life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind. St. Peter sums up in the word "wherefore" all the blessings, privileges, and hopes which he has enumerated; on these he founds his exhortations. <span class="accented">Gird up</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> (literally, "girding up, tucking up long garments by the help of a girdle") occurs in no other place of the New Testament. But the same metaphor, expressed in similar words, is common. St. Peter alludes, doubtless, to the Lord's exhortation, "Let your loins be girded about;" perhaps also the solemn words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-18.htm">John 21:18</a>, "signifying by what death he should glorify God," were present to his thoughts. <span class="accented">The loins of your mind</span>. St. Peter often explains a metaphor by adding a genitive or. adjective; so "milk of the Word; .... hidden man of the heart;" amaranthine wreath of glory." <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, translated "mind," is the reflective faculty. The Christian must reflect, and that with intense exertion of thought, on the glory of his hopes, on the greatness of his responsibilities; he must seek to love God with all his mind (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>), as well as with all his heart and soul. Be sober. The Christian must be sober in his use of the gifts of God; he must be sober also in his habits of thought; he should preserve a calm, collected temper. Christian enthusiasm should be thoughtful, not excited and disorderly (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:11, 12</a>). And hope to the end; rather, <span class="accented">perfectly</span>, with a full, unwavering, constant hope. It is better to take the adverb <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> with the verb "hope" than with <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, "be perfectly sober." For the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. The Christian's hope must be directed to, set towards (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> with accusative), the continual growth in grace ("He giveth more grace," <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). That grace is being brought now, being borne in upon the soul in the present revelation of Jesus Christ. "It pleased God," says St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-16.htm">Galatians 1:16</a>), "to reveal his Son in me." So now the Lord manifests himself to those who walk in the path of loving obedience. Each gift of grace kindles the hope of a nearer manifestation, a fuller revelation; grace is continually brought, till at length the full unspeakable gift of grace is realized at the glorious revelation of Jesus Christ at his second advent. This seems better than to give the present participle <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> a future sense, and to understand the revelation of Jesus Christ only of his final coming in glory. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:13-16 As the traveller, the racer, the warrior, and the labourer, gathered in their long and loose garments, that they might be ready in their business, so let Christians do by their minds and affections. Be sober, be watchful against all spiritual dangers and enemies, and be temperate in all behaviour. Be sober-minded in opinion, as well as in practice, and humble in your judgment of yourselves. A strong and perfect trust in the grace of God, is agreeable with best endeavours in our duty. Holiness is the desire and duty of every Christian. It must be in all affairs, in every condition, and towards all people. We must especially watch and pray against the sins to which we are inclined. The written word of God is the surest rule of a Christian's life, and by this rule we are commanded to be holy every way. God makes those holy whom he saves.</body></html>
