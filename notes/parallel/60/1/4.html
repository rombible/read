This notion of an "inheritance," or property, that we have come in for, is particularly Hebrew, occurring very frequently in the Old Testament. The Pontine dispersion had lost their "inheritance" in Palestine, but there is a better in store for them.<p><span class= "bld">Incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away</span>.--Exuberant description of the excellencies of the new Canaan. The first epithet contrasts its imperishable nature (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-23.htm" title="And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four footed beasts, and creeping things.">Romans 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-10.htm" title="But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death, and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:">2Timothy 1:10</a>) with the fleeting tenure of the earthly Canaan. The second speaks of its freedom from pollutions such as desecrated the first "Holy Land." Perhaps it may specially mean that the new Holy Land will never be profaned by Gentile incursions and tyrannies. The third, and most poetical of all (which is only found besides in <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/6-12.htm" title="Wisdom is glorious, and never fadeth away: yea, she is easily seen of them that love her, and found of such as seek her.">Wisdom Of Solomon 6:12</a>), conveys the notion of the unchanging beauty of that land--no winter ill the inheritance to which the Resurrection brings us (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-11.htm" title="For, see, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;">Song of Solomon 2:11</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Reserved</span>--The perfect tense, <span class= "ital">which hath been reserved unto you, i.e., </span>either in the <span class= "ital">temporal</span> sense--"kept all this while until you came," or "with a view to you." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-40.htm" title="God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.">Hebrews 11:40</a>.) He now adds explicitly that it is no earthly, but a heavenly possession.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away. The Christian's hope maketh not ashamed. The inheritance is sure; it is better than the inheritance promised to Abraham; for it is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">incorruptible</span>. All things earthly have in themselves the seeds of decay and death; but "when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption," the redeemed of the Lord shall receive a kingdom that cannot be moved, where "neither moth nor rust doth corrupt." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It is <span class="accented">undefiled</span>. The inheritance of Israel was defiled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-27.htm">Leviticus 18:27, 28</a>), but into the heavenly inheritance entereth not "anything that defileth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">It fadeth not away</span>. "The grass withereth, the flower falleth away;" it is not so in the "land that is very far off." The crown reserved for its blessed inhabitants is an amaranth wreath (comp. Wisd. 6:13 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-4.htm">1 Peter 5:4</a>, where see note). There are no tendencies to corruption there, no possibilities of defilement, not even that fading which must pass over the fairest things of earth. Reserved in heaven for you. The many mansions in our Father's house have been kept from the beginning, and still are kept for his elect; Satan cannot rob them of it, as he robbed man of the earthly paradise. Some of the Greek commentators find in the words, "in heaven," an argument against the millenarians. Some manuscripts read "for us," but the received reading is best supported. St. Peter passes from one person to another, as St. Paul often does, sometimes addressing his readers directly, sometimes including himself among them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-9 This epistle is addressed to believers in general, who are strangers in every city or country where they live, and are scattered through the nations. These are to ascribe their salvation to the electing love of the Father, the redemption of the Son, and the sanctification of the Holy Ghost; and so to give glory to one God in three Persons, into whose name they had been baptized. Hope, in the world's phrase, refers only to an uncertain good, for all worldly hopes are tottering, built upon sand, and the worldling's hopes of heaven are blind and groundless conjectures. But the hope of the sons of the living God is a living hope; not only as to its object, but as to its effect also. It enlivens and comforts in all distresses, enables to meet and get over all difficulties. Mercy is the spring of all this; yea, great mercy and manifold mercy. And this well-grounded hope of salvation, is an active and living principle of obedience in the soul of the believer. The matter of a Christian's joy, is the remembrance of the happiness laid up for him. It is incorruptible, it cannot come to nothing, it is an estate that cannot be spent. Also undefiled; this signifies its purity and perfection. And it fadeth not; is not sometimes more or less pleasant, but ever the same, still like itself. All possessions here are stained with defects and failings; still something is wanting: fair houses have sad cares flying about the gilded and ceiled roofs; soft beds and full tables, are often with sick bodies and uneasy stomachs. All possessions are stained with sin, either in getting or in using them. How ready we are to turn the things we possess into occasions and instruments of sin, and to think there is no liberty or delight in their use, without abusing them! Worldly possessions are uncertain and soon pass away, like the flowers and plants of the field. That must be of the greatest worth, which is laid up in the highest and best place, in heaven. Happy are those whose hearts the Holy Spirit sets on this inheritance. God not only gives his people grace, but preserves them unto glory. Every believer has always something wherein he may greatly rejoice; it should show itself in the countenance and conduct. The Lord does not willingly afflict, yet his wise love often appoints sharp trials, to show his people their hearts, and to do them good at the latter end. Gold does not increase by trial in the fire, it becomes less; but faith is made firm, and multiplied, by troubles and afflictions. Gold must perish at last, and can only purchase perishing things, while the trial of faith will be found to praise, and honour, and glory. Let this reconcile us to present afflictions. Seek then to believe Christ's excellence in himself, and his love to us; this will kindle such a fire in the heart as will make it rise up in a sacrifice of love to him. And the glory of God and our own happiness are so united, that if we sincerely seek the one now, we shall attain the other when the soul shall no more be subject to evil. The certainty of this hope is as if believers had already received it.</body></html>
