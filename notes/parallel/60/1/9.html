The reason is, he says, because we receive already, in the present life, the object of all this trusting without sight; we need not wait till the next world to attain our glorification.<p><span class= "bld">The salvation of your souls.</span>--It might be simply, <span class= "ital">salvation of souls, </span>including other men's besides our own, but the context is against it, and the absence of articles is characteristic of St. Peter. It seems at first sight not a very exalted object for our faith to work to, the deliverance, or safety, of our own souls. And yet our Lord fully recognises the instinct of the higher self-preservation as that to which the ultimate appeal must be made (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/16-25.htm" title="For whoever will save his life shall lose it: and whoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.">Matthew 16:25-26</a>). He could give His own soul a ransom for many (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>); He could save others and not Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-42.htm" title="He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.">Matthew 27:42</a>); St. Paul could wish himself accursed from Christ for his brethren's sake, "that they might be saved" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm" title="For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh:">Romans 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-1.htm" title="Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.">Romans 10:1</a>); Moses could ask to be "blotted out of the book" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-32.htm" title="Yet now, if you will forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray you, out of your book which you have written.">Exodus 32:32</a>); and yet the fact remains, that in seeking our own welfare, in the highest sense, we are fulfilling a primal law of our being, imposed upon us by the Creator. We are bound to make that our first object, if it were only to gratify Him who has no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, even if we could possibly divest ourselves of all "selfish" interest in the matter.<p>"A charge to keep I have,<p><span class= "ital">A God to glorify</span>;<p>A never-dying soul to save,<p>And fit it for the sky."<p>The Buddhist longing for Nirvana is as far as possible removed from the healthy spirit of Christianity. "Salvation" here seems to have widened its meaning since <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-5.htm" title="Who are kept by the power of God through faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.">1Peter 1:5</a>; while <span class= "ital">there</span> the main thought was final deliverance from the afflictions of life, <span class= "ital">here</span> the salvation is said to be received in the very midst of all these afflictions. The addition of the word "souls," appears to make the difference. For the soul, there is <span class= "ital">present</span> salvation, because persecutions, &c., do not touch it, and it is <span class= "ital">capable</span> of the most complete emancipation from the evils of <span class= "ital">sin</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-21.htm" title="And she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.">Matthew 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-69.htm" title="And has raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;">Luke 1:69</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-71.htm" title="That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;">Luke 1:71</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-75.htm" title="In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.">Luke 1:75</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-14.htm" title="For sin shall not have dominion over you: for you are not under the law, but under grace.">Romans 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/7-24.htm" title="O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?">Romans 7:24-25</a>.) Salvation, then, is the restoration of man to the ideal excellence from which he was fallen: it contains--here, at any rate--no allusion to "damnation" as an opposite.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls. The present participle "receiving" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) implies that the believer realizes the deep blessing of salvation gradually while he is being saved as one of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-47.htm">Acts 2:47</a>). Salvation is present as well as future. "By grace ye are saved through faith" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8</a>); "According to his mercy he saved us" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>). God's elect receive it in various measures now; in its blessed fullness it will be manifested hereafter. It is the end which faith ever holds in view, pressing towards it as the prize of the high calling. It is the salvation especially of souls; for, as Bengel says," Anima praecipue salvatur; corpus in resurreetione participat." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-9 This epistle is addressed to believers in general, who are strangers in every city or country where they live, and are scattered through the nations. These are to ascribe their salvation to the electing love of the Father, the redemption of the Son, and the sanctification of the Holy Ghost; and so to give glory to one God in three Persons, into whose name they had been baptized. Hope, in the world's phrase, refers only to an uncertain good, for all worldly hopes are tottering, built upon sand, and the worldling's hopes of heaven are blind and groundless conjectures. But the hope of the sons of the living God is a living hope; not only as to its object, but as to its effect also. It enlivens and comforts in all distresses, enables to meet and get over all difficulties. Mercy is the spring of all this; yea, great mercy and manifold mercy. And this well-grounded hope of salvation, is an active and living principle of obedience in the soul of the believer. The matter of a Christian's joy, is the remembrance of the happiness laid up for him. It is incorruptible, it cannot come to nothing, it is an estate that cannot be spent. Also undefiled; this signifies its purity and perfection. And it fadeth not; is not sometimes more or less pleasant, but ever the same, still like itself. All possessions here are stained with defects and failings; still something is wanting: fair houses have sad cares flying about the gilded and ceiled roofs; soft beds and full tables, are often with sick bodies and uneasy stomachs. All possessions are stained with sin, either in getting or in using them. How ready we are to turn the things we possess into occasions and instruments of sin, and to think there is no liberty or delight in their use, without abusing them! Worldly possessions are uncertain and soon pass away, like the flowers and plants of the field. That must be of the greatest worth, which is laid up in the highest and best place, in heaven. Happy are those whose hearts the Holy Spirit sets on this inheritance. God not only gives his people grace, but preserves them unto glory. Every believer has always something wherein he may greatly rejoice; it should show itself in the countenance and conduct. The Lord does not willingly afflict, yet his wise love often appoints sharp trials, to show his people their hearts, and to do them good at the latter end. Gold does not increase by trial in the fire, it becomes less; but faith is made firm, and multiplied, by troubles and afflictions. Gold must perish at last, and can only purchase perishing things, while the trial of faith will be found to praise, and honour, and glory. Let this reconcile us to present afflictions. Seek then to believe Christ's excellence in himself, and his love to us; this will kindle such a fire in the heart as will make it rise up in a sacrifice of love to him. And the glory of God and our own happiness are so united, that if we sincerely seek the one now, we shall attain the other when the soul shall no more be subject to evil. The certainty of this hope is as if believers had already received it.</body></html>
