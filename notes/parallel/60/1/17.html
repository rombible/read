(Refer again to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,">1Peter 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-14.htm" title="As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:">1Peter 1:14</a>.) The word seems not only to mean "if you <span class= "ital">appeal</span> to the Father," but "if you appeal to the Father by the <span class= "ital">title</span> of Father." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm" title="For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but you have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.">Romans 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm" title="And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.">Galatians 4:6</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Who without respect of persons judgeth.</span>--This "judgeth," or <span class= "ital">decideth, </span>refers not only to the great judgment of the last day, but is used in reference to the word "if ye <span class= "ital">call upon</span> the Father." That word has a forensic sense (in which it is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-11.htm" title="For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me to them. I appeal to Caesar.">Acts 25:11</a>) of lodging an <span class= "ital">appeal, </span>and every time we lodge our appeal to the Father on the ground of His Fatherhood, He decides the case, but decides it without favour--makes no allowance to our wrong doing on the ground of being His regenerate children, and certainly none on the ground of being of the Hebrew race. That this last notion finds place here we may see from St. Peter's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/10-34.htm" title="Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:">Acts 10:34-35</a>. He decides "according to every man's work"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>upon the individual merits of the case before Him. The man's "work" (not "works") embraces all his conduct in the lump, as a single performance, which is either good on the whole or bad on the whole.<p><span class= "bld">Pass the time . . . in fear.</span>--The word for "pass" really is the same as the "conversation" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-15.htm" title="But as he which has called you is holy, so be you holy in all manner of conversation;">1Peter 1:15</a>, and is intended to take our thought back to it: "As obedient children, be holy in every part of your conduct; and if you wish for favour from the Father, see that that conduct is characterised by <span class= "ital">fear." "</span>This fear," says Archbishop Leighton, "is not cowardice (nor superstition, we may add); it drowns all lower fears, and begets true fortitude; the righteous dare do anything but offend God. Moses was bold and fearless in dealing with a proud and wicked king, but when God appeared he said (as the Apostle informs us), 'I exceedingly fear and quake.'" This extract well contrasts with the meaning which some would apparently thrust into the word "fear," as though it meant that the position of the Christians, as "aliens" in the midst of a hostile world, required a timid attitude towards man. The "fear" of the <span class= "ital">Father</span> may be seen in the first two clauses of the Lord's Prayer itself.<p><span class= "bld">Your sojourning.</span>--See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1Peter 1:1</a>, "strangers." Because the word is metaphorical here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1Peter 2:11</a>, is no reason why the similar word should be so there, in quite a different context. The expression here sets a limit for the discipline of fear, and at the same time suggests a reason for it--children though they are, they are not yet entered on their "inheritance" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-4.htm" title="To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for you,">1Peter 1:4</a>), and have to secure it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - And if ye call on the Father. "If" does not imply doubt; it introduces an hypothesis which, being taken for granted, involves a duty. Apparently there is here a reference to the Lord's Prayer, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a>. You call on God as your Father; then pass your time in fear (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6</a>, "If I be a Father, where is mine honor?"). He called you first; now ye call on him. The translation of the Revised Version is more exact than the Authorized Version, "If ye call on him as Father." Who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work. The adverb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, rendered "without respect of persons," occurs nowhere else in the New Testament; but the thought is familiar. St. Peter himself had said, when he was sent to receive Cornelius into the Church, "Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>). The disciples of the Pharisees had said the same of our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-16.htm">Matthew 22:16</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-6.htm">Galatians 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1-4</a>). The Lord said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>), "The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son." But the Father is "Fens judicii," as Didymus says (quoted by Alford), "judicante Filio, Pater est qu;. judicat," for the Son judges as his Delegate; as it was through the Son that the Father made the worlds. He judges according to every man's work, regarding, not distinctions of rank, or wealth, or nationality, but only the character of the work. Observe that the word "work" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) is in the singular number, as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>. God judges according to every man's work as a whole, according to the whole scope and meaning of his life as issuing from the one governing principle, whether faith or selfishness. So Bengel, "Unius hominis unum est opus, bouum malumve." Pass the time of your sojourning here in fear. The verb here, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, corresponds with the noun <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> ("conversation") of ver. 15; both might be rendered (as Dean Plumptre suggests) by "conduct" (noun or verb) - "in all your conduct" in ver. 15; and here, "conduct yourselves." The word "sojourning" reminds us of ver. 1 of this chapter and of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>, in which last place we have the corresponding Greek word. We are sojourners here, life is short; but the character of that short life determines our eternal condition; therefore live in fear. St. John says, "Perfect love casteth out fear;" but there is no contradiction, as some have said, between the two holy apostles; for the fear which cannot coexist with perfect love (it may in various measures coexist with imperfect love) is slavish fear, selfish fear of death and punishment. The fear which St. Peter and St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12</a>) commend is holy fear - the fear of a son for a loving father, the fear of displeasing God before whom we walk, God who gave his blessed Son to die for us, God who will judge us at the last. This fear is not cowardice. Our Lord said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-4.htm">Luke 12:4</a>), "Be not afraid of them that kill the body.... Fear him," etc. They who fear God need fear nothing else but God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:17-25 Holy confidence in God as a Father, and awful fear of him as a Judge, agree together; and to regard God always as a Judge, makes him dear to us as a Father. If believers do evil, God will visit them with corrections. Then, let Christians not doubt God's faithfulness to his promises, nor give way to enslaving dread of his wrath, but let them reverence his holiness. The fearless professor is defenceless, and Satan takes him captive at his will; the desponding professor has no heart to avail himself of his advantages, and is easily brought to surrender. The price paid for man's redemption was the precious blood of Christ. Not only openly wicked, but unprofitable conversation is highly dangerous, though it may plead custom. It is folly to resolve, I will live and die in such a way, because my forefathers did so. God had purposes of special favour toward his people, long before he made manifest such grace unto them. But the clearness of light, the supports of faith, the power of ordinances, are all much greater since Christ came upon earth, than they were before. The comfort is, that being by faith made one with Christ, his present glory is an assurance that where he is we shall be also, Joh 14:3. The soul must be purified, before it can give up its own desires and indulgences. And the word of God planted in the heart by the Holy Ghost, is a means of spiritual life, stirring up to our duty, working a total change in the dispositions and affections of the soul, till it brings to eternal life. In contrast with the excellence of the renewed spiritual man, as born again, observe the vanity of the natural man. In his life, and in his fall, he is like grass, the flower of grass, which soon withers and dies away. We should hear, and thus receive and love, the holy, living word, and rather hazard all than lose it; and we must banish all other things from the place due to it. We should lodge it in our hearts as our only treasures here, and the certain pledge of the treasure of glory laid up for believers in heaven.</body></html>
