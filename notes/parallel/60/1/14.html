It is characteristic of the writer to keep one thought underlying many digressions, and so here, the appeal to them as "children" is based on the "begotten again" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,">1Peter 1:3</a>, and "inheritance" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-4.htm" title="To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for you,">1Peter 1:4</a>; it comes up again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-17.htm" title="And if you call on the Father, who without respect of persons judges according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:">1Peter 1:17</a>, "the Father"; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-22.htm" title="Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:">1Peter 1:22</a>, "the brethren"; and again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-23.htm" title="Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which lives and stays for ever.">1Peter 1:23</a>, "begotten again." The usual characteristic of Jews in the New Testament is <span class= "ital">disobedience.</span> (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm" title="In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:">2Thessalonians 1:8</a>.) The "as" means "in keeping with your character of," just as we say in common English, "Do so <span class= "ital">like</span> obedient children."<p><span class= "bld">Not fashioning yourselves according to.</span>--This rare verb is the same as is translated "be not conformed," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-2.htm" title="And be not conformed to this world: but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.">Romans 12:2</a>, from which some think it is borrowed. The expression is a little confused, the lusts themselves being spoken of as a model not to be copied, where we should rather have expected "not being conformed to your former selves."<p><span class= "bld">The former lusts in your ignorance</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, which you indulged before you came to know the gospel truth--of course implying also that the ignorance was the mother of the lusts. The same assumption is made here which we shall find again below in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-9.htm" title="But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;">1Peter 2:9</a>, and still more in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-3.htm" title="For the time past of our life may suffice us to have worked the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revelings, parties, and abominable idolatries:">1Peter 4:3</a>, that the recipients of this Letter had lived in ignorance and in vice up to a certain point of their lives. And it is contended, with much plausibility, that both accusations show the recipients of the letter to be of Gentile and not of Jewish origin. It is true that lusts of the flesh are not usually laid to the charge of the Jews, as they are of the Gentiles. (See, for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-5.htm" title="Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:">1Thessalonians 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-17.htm" title="This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you from now on walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,">Ephesians 4:17</a>.) It is also true that the ignorance with which the Jews are charged (for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-17.htm" title="And now, brothers, I know that through ignorance you did it, as did also your rulers.">Acts 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-3.htm" title="For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.">Romans 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-13.htm" title="Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.">1Timothy 1:13</a>) has quite a different tendency from this. But it may be answered that such details are of little weight in comparison with the direct evidence of the first verse, and the indirect evidence of the whole tone of the Letter; also that, putting out of sight expressions of St. Paul's which have nothing to do with St. Peter, "ignorance" is surely not an unnatural word to represent the contrast between the state of unregenerate Jews and the same persons when they have attained to knowledge higher than that of prophets or of angels; that even Jews were men of flesh and blood, and therefore not exempt from the temptations of the flesh, from which mere legalism was quite insufficient to protect them (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-8.htm" title="But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, worked in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.">Romans 7:8</a>, "sin through the commandment wrought in me <span class= "ital">every lust</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span> that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-2.htm" title="Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.">Hebrews 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-7.htm" title="But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:">Hebrews 9:7</a>, Jewish people are supposed to have need of a high priest to bear with and atone for their "ignorance" and "ignorances;" that the same writer contemplates the possibility of "many" of his Hebrews being "defiled" through fleshly sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/12-15.htm" title="Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;">Hebrews 12:15-16</a>), and deems it necessary to urge strongly the sanctions of marriage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-4.htm" title="Marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled: but fornicators and adulterers God will judge.">Hebrews 13:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - As obedient children; rather, <span class="accented">children of obedience</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-14.htm">2 Peter 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-8.htm">Luke 16:8</a>). Winer says ('Grammar,' 3. 34; 'Romans,' 2), "This mode of expression is to be traced to the more lively imagination of the Orientals, by which the most intimate connection (derivation from and dependence on) - even when the reference is to what is not material - is viewed under the image of the relation of son or child to parent. Hence ' children of disobedience' are those who belong to disobedience as a child to his mother - disobedience having become their nature, their predominant disposition." Not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance. The remarkable word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> seems to be an echo of Born. 12:2, the only other place where it occurs. It implies that men who live in sensual lusts take up the likeness of those lusts into themselves, and are made, not as man was at first, after the likeness of God, but after the likeness of those lusts of the flesh which are not of the Father, but are of the world. The word "ignorance" is to be taken closely with "lusts" - "the former lusts which were in the time of your ignorance." It seems to imply that St. Peter is addressing Gentiles as well as Jews; top, though ignorance is attributed to the Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-17.htm">Acts 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-3.htm">Romans 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13</a>), it was ignorance, not of the moral law, as here, but of the Person and office of Christ. The Jews had the oracles of God; they knew his will (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-2.htm">Romans 3:2</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:13-16 As the traveller, the racer, the warrior, and the labourer, gathered in their long and loose garments, that they might be ready in their business, so let Christians do by their minds and affections. Be sober, be watchful against all spiritual dangers and enemies, and be temperate in all behaviour. Be sober-minded in opinion, as well as in practice, and humble in your judgment of yourselves. A strong and perfect trust in the grace of God, is agreeable with best endeavours in our duty. Holiness is the desire and duty of every Christian. It must be in all affairs, in every condition, and towards all people. We must especially watch and pray against the sins to which we are inclined. The written word of God is the surest rule of a Christian's life, and by this rule we are commanded to be holy every way. God makes those holy whom he saves.</body></html>
