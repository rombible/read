The substantive appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-68.htm" title="Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he has visited and redeemed his people,">Luke 1:68</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-38.htm" title="And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise to the Lord, and spoke of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.">Luke 2:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-12.htm" title="Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.">Hebrews 9:12</a>, to represent the <span class= "ital">action</span> of redeeming; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-35.htm" title="This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.">Acts 7:35</a>, of Moses, to represent the <span class= "ital">person</span> who effects such a redemption. Properly it means to ransom a person, to get them out of slavery or captivity by paying a ransom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-45.htm" title="For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Mark 10:45</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-6.htm" title="Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.">1Timothy 2:6</a>). The notion of an actual ransom paid, however, was apt to slip away, as in the case of Moses just quoted, who certainly gave nothing of the nature of an equivalent to Pharaoh for the loss of his serfs. So that here, as in all passages relating to the Atonement, we must be very careful not to press the metaphor, or to consider it as more than a metaphor. The leading notion here is not that of paying an equivalent, but to call closer attention to the state in which the readers were before. It was a servitude like that of Egypt, or a captivity like that of Babylon, from which they needed a "ransomer" like Moses or Zerubbabel. What then was that condition? (2) St. Peter describes it as a "vain conversation traditional from the fathers." The word "conversation" again catches up <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-15.htm" title="But as he which has called you is holy, so be you holy in all manner of conversation;">1Peter 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-17.htm" title="And if you call on the Father, who without respect of persons judges according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:">1Peter 1:17</a>, "be holy in your conduct; let it be a conduct of fear; for your old vain conduct needed a terrible ransom before you could be set at liberty from it." The question is, whether a Gentile or Jewish mode of life is intended. If it meant merely as regards religious worship, it would suit either way, for it was of the essence of Roman state "religion" that it should be the same from generation to generation. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-14.htm" title="But this I confess to you, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:">Acts 24:14</a>.) But "conversation" or "manner of life" is far too wide a word to be thus limited, and at the same time the word "tradition" implies (in the New Testament) something sedulously taught, purposely handed down from father to son as an heirloom, so that it could not be applied to the careless, sensual life of Gentiles, learned by example only. On the other hand, among the Jews "tradition" entered into the minutest details of daily life or "conversation." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/7-3.htm" title="For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.">Mark 7:3-4</a>--the Petrine Gospel.) It was a matter of serious "tradition" how a cup was to be washed. "Vain" (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>frivolous) seems not an unnatural epithet to apply to such a mode of life, especially to one who had heard <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-7.htm" title="However, in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.">Mark 7:7</a>. It would seem, then, that the readers of this Letter were certainly Jews by birth. But would the Apostle of the Circumcision, the supposed head of the legal party in the Church, dare to call Judaism a "vain conversation," to stigmatise it (the single compound adjective in the Greek has a contemptuous ring) as "imposed by tradition of the fathers," and to imply that it was like an Egyptian bondage? We have only to turn to <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-10.htm" title="Now therefore why tempt you God, to put a yoke on the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?">Acts 15:10</a>, and we find him uttering precisely the same sentiments, and calling Judaism a slavish "yoke," which was not only so bad for Gentiles that to impose it upon them was to tempt God, but also was secretly or openly felt intolerable by himself, by all the Jews there present, and even by the fathers who had imposed it. Judaism itself, then, in the form it had then assumed, was one of the foes and oppressors from which Christ came to "ransom" and "save" His people. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/1-9.htm" title="Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.">1Peter 1:9-10</a>, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-39.htm" title="And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.">Acts 13:39</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Forasmuch as ye know</span>; literally, <span class="accented">knowing, considering</span>. That ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold. The order in the original gives mere emphasis: "That not with corruptible things, silver and gold, were ye redeemed." Afford notes here that the diminutives (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>) stand generally (not always) for the coined or wrought metal. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "ye were ransomed," seems to point back to the great saying of our Lord, "The Son of man came... to give his life a ransom for many (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>)" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a>). Doubtless no human language can adequately express the mystery of the atonement. That stupendous fact transcends human reason, and cannot be exactly defined in human words. But the Lord himself describes it as a ransom" a ransom for many," given in their stead. Reverence keeps us from pressing the illustration in all its details. It may be that the correspondence between the atonement and the redemption of a slave from an earthly master is not exact in all points. But the illustration comes from the Lord himself, who is the Truth; it must be true as far as human language permits, as far as human reason can comprehend. It teaches, as plainly as words can express, the doctrine of vicarious satisfaction: he gave his life, not only in behalf of us, but also instead of us - a ransom for our sins. Compare the use of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>), "Ye are bought with a price;" and (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>), "The Lord that bought them;" also <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>), "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the Law." From your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; literally, <span class="accented">out of your vain manner of life or conduct</span>. The word here rendered '" vain ' is used of idolatry in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-15.htm">Acts 14:15</a>, and also the corresponding verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21</a>. St. Peter seems to be thinking mainly of Gentile Christians; he would scarcely describe the sinful conversation of Israelites as "handed down from your fathers" (Revised Version) without some qualification. Habits are transmitted from fathers to children; habitual custom is made an excuse for many shortcomings, but "unus Pater imitandus" (Bengel). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:17-25 Holy confidence in God as a Father, and awful fear of him as a Judge, agree together; and to regard God always as a Judge, makes him dear to us as a Father. If believers do evil, God will visit them with corrections. Then, let Christians not doubt God's faithfulness to his promises, nor give way to enslaving dread of his wrath, but let them reverence his holiness. The fearless professor is defenceless, and Satan takes him captive at his will; the desponding professor has no heart to avail himself of his advantages, and is easily brought to surrender. The price paid for man's redemption was the precious blood of Christ. Not only openly wicked, but unprofitable conversation is highly dangerous, though it may plead custom. It is folly to resolve, I will live and die in such a way, because my forefathers did so. God had purposes of special favour toward his people, long before he made manifest such grace unto them. But the clearness of light, the supports of faith, the power of ordinances, are all much greater since Christ came upon earth, than they were before. The comfort is, that being by faith made one with Christ, his present glory is an assurance that where he is we shall be also, Joh 14:3. The soul must be purified, before it can give up its own desires and indulgences. And the word of God planted in the heart by the Holy Ghost, is a means of spiritual life, stirring up to our duty, working a total change in the dispositions and affections of the soul, till it brings to eternal life. In contrast with the excellence of the renewed spiritual man, as born again, observe the vanity of the natural man. In his life, and in his fall, he is like grass, the flower of grass, which soon withers and dies away. We should hear, and thus receive and love, the holy, living word, and rather hazard all than lose it; and we must banish all other things from the place due to it. We should lodge it in our hearts as our only treasures here, and the certain pledge of the treasure of glory laid up for believers in heaven.</body></html>
