The calling is the fulfillment of the election:, "Whom he did predestinate, them he also called." The Christian's effort must be to fashion himself, by God's grace, after the likeness of God. not according to the former lusts (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45, 48</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>). So be ye holy in all manner of conversation. In the whole course of your daily life, in all its details, as you move hither and thither among men, take the holiness of God for your pattern: "Be not conformed to this world." (For the word "conversation" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>), comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-13.htm">Galatians 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-7.htm">Hebrews 13:7</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:13-16 As the traveller, the racer, the warrior, and the labourer, gathered in their long and loose garments, that they might be ready in their business, so let Christians do by their minds and affections. Be sober, be watchful against all spiritual dangers and enemies, and be temperate in all behaviour. Be sober-minded in opinion, as well as in practice, and humble in your judgment of yourselves. A strong and perfect trust in the grace of God, is agreeable with best endeavours in our duty. Holiness is the desire and duty of every Christian. It must be in all affairs, in every condition, and towards all people. We must especially watch and pray against the sins to which we are inclined. The written word of God is the surest rule of a Christian's life, and by this rule we are commanded to be holy every way. God makes those holy whom he saves.</body></html>
