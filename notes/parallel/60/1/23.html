It is logically parallel with "seeing ye have purified," and might be rendered, <span class= "ital">seeing that ye have been begotten again.</span> For the meaning of the word, refer back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,">1Peter 1:3</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Not of corruptible seed</span>.--That is, <span class= "ital">not of the seed of Abraham, but of the seed of God.</span> This is the argument: "You must learn not to be selfish, or arrogant, as being of the chosen race, but to have a true brotherly feeling and earnest love for the Gentile converts, and for those who, like St. Paul, are specially working for the Gentiles, because your inheritance of the promised 'salvation' is grounded, not on your Abrahamic descent, but on your spiritual regeneration, in which matter the Gentile converts are your equals." That this was the doctrine of St. Peter is certain from his speech at the Council of Jerusalem, "God put no difference between us and them, having purified their hearts by faith;" and again, "It is only through the favour of the Lord Jesus that we hope to be saved, in precisely the same manner as they" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-9.htm" title="And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.">Acts 15:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-11.htm" title="But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.">Acts 15:11</a>). (Comp., for the argument, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-1.htm" title="Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loves him that begat loves him also that is begotten of him.">1John 5:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">By the word of God.</span>--"Seed," in the beginning of the clause, is more literally the act of <span class= "ital">sowing, </span>or <span class= "ital">engendering, </span>which sowing is carried on "through the living and abiding word of God," this "word of God" being the actual seed sown. The "seed" of all existence is the spoken Word of God, the expressed will and meaning of creative thought (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-6.htm" title="By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.">Psalm 33:6</a>); and so here, even when spoken mediately, through the lips of men (as explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-25.htm" title="But the word of the Lord endures for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached to you.">1Peter 1:25</a>), it is that which begets men afresh. God creates afresh, though men speak the creative word for Him, just as "it is He that hath made us," although He does so through natural laws and human powers. The "Word of God" here is, no doubt, the preaching of the gospel, but especially, as it would seem, the preaching of the Resurrection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,">1Peter 1:3</a>), or of the sufferings and glories of Messiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1Peter 1:12</a>), the "truth" of the last verse. The part taken by "the Word" in the sacrament of regeneration may be seen again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-26.htm" title="That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,">Ephesians 5:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-18.htm" title="Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.">James 1:18</a>; in connection with the other sacrament we may also refer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-63.htm" title="It is the spirit that vivifies; the flesh profits nothing: the words that I speak to you, they are spirit, and they are life.">John 6:63</a>. "Incorruptible" (<span class= "ital">i.e., imperishable</span>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-4.htm" title="To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for you,">1Peter 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm" title="For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;">1Peter 1:18</a>) finds a more energetic paraphrase here in "living and abiding" (the words "for ever" not being part of the true text). The former epithet is a favourite with St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,">1Peter 1:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/2-4.htm" title="To whom coming, as to a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,">1Peter 2:4-5</a>), and is perhaps borrowed from this place by the author to the Hebrews, in connection with the "word of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-12.htm" title="For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.">Hebrews 4:12</a>). The epithets serve to prepare the way for the quotation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Being born again</span>; rather, <span class="accented">having been begotten again</span>. St. Peter repeats the verb used already in ver. 3. It is the highest argument for brotherly love; the children of the one Father are all brethren; they should "love as brethren" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-8.htm">1 Peter 3:8</a>). Not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God, which liveth and abideth forever. The word used here (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>) means, properly, "sowing;" but, like <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-11.htm">Luke 8:11</a>), it stands also for the seed; and here the epithets "corruptible" and "incorruptible" seem to necessitate this second meaning. In the passage quoted from St. Luke, the seed (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is identified with the Word. "The seed is the Word of God." Here there seems to be a distinction. God's elect are begotten again of incorruptible seed through the Word. The use of different prepositions, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> apparently implies a difference between the seed and the Word. In the conversation with Nicodemus the Lord had said, "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." And he continues, "That which is born of the flesh [<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which seems to correspond with the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> of St. Peter] is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit;" where the Greek words, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "that which is begotten of the Spirit," correspond very nearly with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "those who are begotten again of incorruptible seed." Then the incorruptible seed is the Holy Spirit of God, the Source of all spiritual life; it is the Spirit that "beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God;" "To be spiritually minded is life." Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9</a>, "Whosoever is born of God (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) cloth not commit sin: for his seed (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) abideth in him: and he cannot sin because he is born of God"). There is a different explanation of this last passage: "God's seed, that is, his children, abide in him." But on the whole, it seems to be parallel with this verse, and to teach the same doctrine, that the first gift of the Spirit is the germ of spiritual life, and that that precious germ, abiding in the true children of God, lives and energizes "till we come... unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>). But if the Holy Spirit of God is, in the deepest sense, the Seed of the new birth, the Word is the instrument. God's elect are begotten again <span class="accented">through</span> the Word, the Word preached, heard, read, pronounced in holy baptism. The Word preached by St. Peter on the great Day of Pentecost was the means by which three thousand souls were led to be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-18.htm">James 1:18</a>, "Of his own will begat he us with the Word of truth"). Again, the Word preached derives its power from the personal Word, from him who is the Word of God. "All things were made through him" (John L 3; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>); and as the first creation was through him, so is the new creation. He is "the Beginning of the creation of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>); for he is our Life, the life hidden in the heart. He is the Word of life: "He that hath the Son hath life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-12.htm">1 John 5:12</a>); "Through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>). It is through the Lord Jesus Christ that we receive the grace of the new birth. The words, "which liveth and abideth," may be connected with the Divine Name: "God, who liveth and abideth; "or, as in our version, with "the Word." The last connection seems most suitable here (comp. ver. 25, "The Word of the Lord abideth for ever;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>, "The Word of God is quick and powerful'). The most ancient manuscripts omit the words, "forever." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:17-25 Holy confidence in God as a Father, and awful fear of him as a Judge, agree together; and to regard God always as a Judge, makes him dear to us as a Father. If believers do evil, God will visit them with corrections. Then, let Christians not doubt God's faithfulness to his promises, nor give way to enslaving dread of his wrath, but let them reverence his holiness. The fearless professor is defenceless, and Satan takes him captive at his will; the desponding professor has no heart to avail himself of his advantages, and is easily brought to surrender. The price paid for man's redemption was the precious blood of Christ. Not only openly wicked, but unprofitable conversation is highly dangerous, though it may plead custom. It is folly to resolve, I will live and die in such a way, because my forefathers did so. God had purposes of special favour toward his people, long before he made manifest such grace unto them. But the clearness of light, the supports of faith, the power of ordinances, are all much greater since Christ came upon earth, than they were before. The comfort is, that being by faith made one with Christ, his present glory is an assurance that where he is we shall be also, Joh 14:3. The soul must be purified, before it can give up its own desires and indulgences. And the word of God planted in the heart by the Holy Ghost, is a means of spiritual life, stirring up to our duty, working a total change in the dispositions and affections of the soul, till it brings to eternal life. In contrast with the excellence of the renewed spiritual man, as born again, observe the vanity of the natural man. In his life, and in his fall, he is like grass, the flower of grass, which soon withers and dies away. We should hear, and thus receive and love, the holy, living word, and rather hazard all than lose it; and we must banish all other things from the place due to it. We should lodge it in our hearts as our only treasures here, and the certain pledge of the treasure of glory laid up for believers in heaven.</body></html>
