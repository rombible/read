The "who" might be rendered by "and you;" and the clause adds a kind of proof of the foregoing statement, drawn from the result of God's manifestation of Christ to them. "This Christian doctrine is no innovation, nothing to lead you away from the God of our fathers. That same God had had the scheme in His thoughts from the beginning, and it is in that same God that you have been led thereby to believe." There is a better supported and more forcible reading, <span class= "ital">Who through Him are faithful towards God, </span>which combines the ideas of believing, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>putting the whole trust in God, and of loyal inward observance of Him. And if any one asks whether it be possible to say that Hebrew men only came to believe in God through the revelation of Christ, we must answer by pointing to the whole scope of the Epistle to the Hebrews, and especially to <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-12.htm" title="Take heed, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.">Hebrews 3:12</a>, where it is not faith in Christ, but faith in a living God, which they are warned not to abandon: and to <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-1.htm" title="Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,">Hebrews 6:1</a>, where faith toward God is part of the "word of the beginning of <span class= "ital">Christ.</span>"<p><span class= "bld">That raised him up.</span>--These clauses give the historical facts which had led them, "through Christ," to a living faith in God. Though the thought is common with St. Paul (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-2.htm" title="(Which he had promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)">Romans 1:2-4</a>), St. Peter was familiar with it years before St. Paul's conversion. See this in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/2-23.htm" title="Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:">Acts 2:23-24</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/2-33.htm" title="Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he has shed forth this, which you now see and hear.">Acts 2:33-36</a> of the same chapter will show what he means by "gave Him glory"--not to be confined to the Ascension, though that is the prominent thought; the glory was already partly given in the Resurrection. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-1.htm" title="These words spoke Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify your Son, that your Son also may glorify you:">John 17:1</a>, where there is the same reciprocal glorification of the Father and the Son, as here.<p><span class= "bld">That your faith . . . might . . .</span>--An inexact rendering which obscures the connection. Literally it is, <span class= "ital">so that your faith and hope is in</span> (or, <span class= "ital">toward</span>)<span class= "ital"> God</span>; that is to say, "Your faith and hope does not stop short in Jesus." Hammond seems, to be quite right in paraphrasing, "Who by believing on Him (Jesus Christ) are far from departing from the God of Israel, but do, indeed, the more firmly believe and depend on Him as that omnipotent God who hath raised Christ from the dead." The co-equal Son is less than the Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-28.htm" title="You have heard how I said to you, I go away, and come again to you. If you loved me, you would rejoice, because I said, I go to the Father: for my Father is greater than I.">John 14:28</a>); and we should terribly mistake the meaning of the gospel were we content to rest in the love of Christ Himself without accepting His revelation of the Father. This is the "living hope" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,">1Peter 1:3</a>, brought about by Christ's resurrection. Some of the German commentators translate, "So that your faith may be also hope in God;" which has nothing ungrammatical in it, but does not suit the context so well.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who by him do believe in God</span>; or, according to two of the most ancient manuscripts, <span class="accented">who through him are faithful towards God</span>. Through himself, not only through his incarnation and atoning death, but through his grace and abiding presence. He was manifested for your sake who through him are faithful; for all the faithful, whether Jews or Gentiles; "for your glory," St. Paul says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-7.htm">1 Corinthians 2:7</a>). The thought shows the greatness of God's love for his elect. The eternal Son was manifested for their sake; it gives an additional stimulus for Christian effort. That <span class="accented">raised</span> him up from the dead, and gave him glory. St. Peter returns to the "after-glories," which he had mentioned in ver. 11. The death of Christ is the atonement for sin; his resurrection and ascension are the grounds of our confidence and hope. They throw back a halo of Divine glory upon the awful cross; they bring out the beauty and the dignity of the atoning sacrifice; they show that it is accepted, that the work of our redemption is complete. The Resurrection held a very prominent place in the preaching of St. Peter, and, indeed, of all the apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32-36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-15.htm">Acts 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-10.htm">Acts 4:10</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-33.htm">Acts 4:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>, etc.). That your faith and hope might be in God; rather, <span class="accented">so that your faith and hope are in God - directed</span> towards God (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>); or perhaps, as Weiss, Huther, and others, "so that your faith is at the same time hope towards God." The resurrection and the glory of Christ not only inspire the Christian with confidence in God, but they also give his faith the character of hope; they fill it with hope. Christ had promised that where he is there should his servant be; he had prayed that those whom the Father had given him should be with him where he is, to behold his glory. He is in heaven, on the right hand of God. Thus the Christian's faith assumes the attitude of hope; he hopes to be where Christ is, to see him as he is, to be made like unto him. This is "the hope of glory" for which we offer our thanksgivings. St. Peter is the apostle of hope. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:17-25 Holy confidence in God as a Father, and awful fear of him as a Judge, agree together; and to regard God always as a Judge, makes him dear to us as a Father. If believers do evil, God will visit them with corrections. Then, let Christians not doubt God's faithfulness to his promises, nor give way to enslaving dread of his wrath, but let them reverence his holiness. The fearless professor is defenceless, and Satan takes him captive at his will; the desponding professor has no heart to avail himself of his advantages, and is easily brought to surrender. The price paid for man's redemption was the precious blood of Christ. Not only openly wicked, but unprofitable conversation is highly dangerous, though it may plead custom. It is folly to resolve, I will live and die in such a way, because my forefathers did so. God had purposes of special favour toward his people, long before he made manifest such grace unto them. But the clearness of light, the supports of faith, the power of ordinances, are all much greater since Christ came upon earth, than they were before. The comfort is, that being by faith made one with Christ, his present glory is an assurance that where he is we shall be also, Joh 14:3. The soul must be purified, before it can give up its own desires and indulgences. And the word of God planted in the heart by the Holy Ghost, is a means of spiritual life, stirring up to our duty, working a total change in the dispositions and affections of the soul, till it brings to eternal life. In contrast with the excellence of the renewed spiritual man, as born again, observe the vanity of the natural man. In his life, and in his fall, he is like grass, the flower of grass, which soon withers and dies away. We should hear, and thus receive and love, the holy, living word, and rather hazard all than lose it; and we must banish all other things from the place due to it. We should lodge it in our hearts as our only treasures here, and the certain pledge of the treasure of glory laid up for believers in heaven.</body></html>
