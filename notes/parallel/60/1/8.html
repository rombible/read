There seems to be a kind of tender pity in the words, as spoken by one who himself had seen so abundantly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-20.htm" title="For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.">Acts 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-41.htm" title="Not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.">Acts 10:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-16.htm" title="For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.">2Peter 1:16</a>). In this and the following verse we return again from the sorrow to the joy, and to the true cause of that joy, which is only to be found in the love of Jesus Christ. There is another reading, though not so good either in sense or in authority, "whom, without <span class= "ital">knowing</span> Him, ye love." Bengel remarks that this is intended for a paradox, sight and knowledge being the usual parents of love.<p><span class= "bld">Ye love.</span>--The word of calm and divinely-given attachment, in fact the usual word in the New Testament, that which Christ used in questioning the writer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-15.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, why weep you? whom seek you? She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, Sir, if you have borne him hence, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.">John 20:15</a>), not the word of warm human friendship with which St. Peter then answered Him.<p><span class= "bld">In whom.</span>--To be construed, not with "ye rejoice," but with "believing." The participles give the <span class= "ital">grounds</span> of the rejoicing: "because at present without seeing ye believe in Him none the less, therefore ye rejoice." The word "rejoice" takes us back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-6.htm" title="Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, you are in heaviness through manifold temptations:">1Peter 1:6</a> : "ye greatly rejoice, I repeat." Notice, again, the stress laid on faith: we have already had it three times mentioned. St. Peter, whose own faith gained him his name and prerogative, is, at least, as much the Apostle of faith as St. Paul is, though his conception of it, perhaps, slightly differs from St. Paul's. The definition given by the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-1.htm" title="Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.">Hebrews 11:1</a>) might have been, perhaps was, drawn from a study of St. Peter's writings. Our present verse gives us the leading thought of "faith" as it appears in both of these works addressed to Hebrews, viz., its being the opposite of <span class= "ital">sight, "</span>the evidence of things not seen," rather than as the opposite of <span class= "ital">works.</span> And the main object of both these Epistles is to keep the Hebrews from slipping back from internal to external religion, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to strengthen <span class= "ital">faith.</span> (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-12.htm" title="Take heed, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.">Hebrews 3:12</a>.) The Apostle is full of admiration for a faith which (unlike his own) was not based on sight. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-29.htm" title="Jesus said to him, Thomas, because you have seen me, you have believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.">John 20:29</a>--an incident which may have been in the writer's mind.)<p><span class= "bld">Unspeakable.</span>--The beautiful Greek word (which means "unable to find expression in words") seems to have been coined by St. Peter.<p><span class= "bld">Full of glory.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">that hath been glorified; i.e., </span>a joy that has reached its ideal pitch, and feels no further sense of imperfection; a signification of the word found, for instance, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-30.htm" title="Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.">Romans 8:30</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whom having not seen, ye love</span>. Some ancient manuscripts read <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, "although ye know him not:" but the reading <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is best supported, and gives the better sense. The Christians of Asia Minor had not seen the gracious face of the Lord, as St. Peter had. But though they had never known him after the flesh, they knew him by the inner knowledge of spiritual communion, and, having learned to love him, had attained the blessing promised to those who had not seen, but yet had believed. St. Peter may possibly be thinking of his well-remembered interview with the risen Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>). He has here the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span>, expressive of reverential love, which Christ had used in his first two questions; not the word of warm human affection (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> ) which he himself had employed in his three answers. In whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory. The words, "in whom" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bd;</span>, literally, "on whom now not looking, but believing"), are to be taken with the participles "seeing" and "believing," not with "ye rejoice." St. Peter insists on the necessity and blessedness of faith as earnestly as St. Paul does, though with him the antithesis is rather between faith and sight than between faith and works. As a tact, St. Peter's readers had never seen the Lord; now, though not seeing him with the outward eye, they realized his presence by faith, and in that presence they rejoiced. The verb is that used in ver. 6 - they rejoiced greatly, they exulted, and that though they saw him not. Human love needs the seen presence of the beloved one to complete the fullness of its joy (2 John 12); but their joy was even amid afflictions unspeakable - like all our deepest and holiest feelings, not to be expressed in words; and it was glorified by the unseen presence of Christ. His chosen behold even now, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, and, beholding, are changed into the same image from glory to glory. Joy in the Lord is a foretaste of the joy of heaven, and is irradiated by glimpses of the glory that shall be revealed. Others, as Huther and Alford, again give to the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, "ye rejoice," a quasi-future sense. The word for "unspeakable" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) is found only here. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-9 This epistle is addressed to believers in general, who are strangers in every city or country where they live, and are scattered through the nations. These are to ascribe their salvation to the electing love of the Father, the redemption of the Son, and the sanctification of the Holy Ghost; and so to give glory to one God in three Persons, into whose name they had been baptized. Hope, in the world's phrase, refers only to an uncertain good, for all worldly hopes are tottering, built upon sand, and the worldling's hopes of heaven are blind and groundless conjectures. But the hope of the sons of the living God is a living hope; not only as to its object, but as to its effect also. It enlivens and comforts in all distresses, enables to meet and get over all difficulties. Mercy is the spring of all this; yea, great mercy and manifold mercy. And this well-grounded hope of salvation, is an active and living principle of obedience in the soul of the believer. The matter of a Christian's joy, is the remembrance of the happiness laid up for him. It is incorruptible, it cannot come to nothing, it is an estate that cannot be spent. Also undefiled; this signifies its purity and perfection. And it fadeth not; is not sometimes more or less pleasant, but ever the same, still like itself. All possessions here are stained with defects and failings; still something is wanting: fair houses have sad cares flying about the gilded and ceiled roofs; soft beds and full tables, are often with sick bodies and uneasy stomachs. All possessions are stained with sin, either in getting or in using them. How ready we are to turn the things we possess into occasions and instruments of sin, and to think there is no liberty or delight in their use, without abusing them! Worldly possessions are uncertain and soon pass away, like the flowers and plants of the field. That must be of the greatest worth, which is laid up in the highest and best place, in heaven. Happy are those whose hearts the Holy Spirit sets on this inheritance. God not only gives his people grace, but preserves them unto glory. Every believer has always something wherein he may greatly rejoice; it should show itself in the countenance and conduct. The Lord does not willingly afflict, yet his wise love often appoints sharp trials, to show his people their hearts, and to do them good at the latter end. Gold does not increase by trial in the fire, it becomes less; but faith is made firm, and multiplied, by troubles and afflictions. Gold must perish at last, and can only purchase perishing things, while the trial of faith will be found to praise, and honour, and glory. Let this reconcile us to present afflictions. Seek then to believe Christ's excellence in himself, and his love to us; this will kindle such a fire in the heart as will make it rise up in a sacrifice of love to him. And the glory of God and our own happiness are so united, that if we sincerely seek the one now, we shall attain the other when the soul shall no more be subject to evil. The certainty of this hope is as if believers had already received it.</body></html>
