The word "according" never means exactly the same as "in" or "by"; here it rather shows that the particular instance was in keeping with what might have been expected, had we but known, from the "much pity" which God must have felt for creatures so forlorn. Our regeneration was no sudden capricious favour.<p><span class= "bld">Hath begotten us again.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">begat us again</span>--the historical moment being here given as that of the resurrection of Christ. This great word, which is St. Peter's own, being only found again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-20.htm" title="Who truly was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,">1Peter 1:20</a>, evidently contains the whole meaning of the being "born from above" or "begotten all over again" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-3.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.">John 3:3</a>, of the "fresh creation" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm" title="Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.">2Corinthians 5:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-15.htm" title="For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.">Galatians 6:15</a>, of the "regeneration" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a>, of the "begotten of God" in St. John's Epistle, and (to a certain extent) of the "brought He us forth" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-18.htm" title="Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.">James 1:18</a>. It seems to indicate that, if it takes effect, it makes a complete change not only in the condition and prospects of the man, but in the man himself: such a change, for example, as would pass over an animal if it were suddenly to receive the powers of a human being. It is no metaphor when the change from the natural man to a man united with the Incarnate God is described as an act of <span class= "ital">creation</span> parallel only to those of the creation of matter and force (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.">Genesis 1:1-2</a>), the creation of life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-21.htm" title="And God created great whales, and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.">Genesis 1:21</a>), and the creation of humanity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-27.htm" title="So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.">Genesis 1:27</a>), for, according to St. Peter's teaching, we are thus actually made "partakers of the divine nature" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-4.htm" title="Whereby are given to us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.">2Peter 1:4</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Unto a lively hope.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">into a living hope.</span> Before this regeneration there was nothing to look forward to--at best a kind of dead-alive surmise that there <span class= "ital">might</span> be something beyond the weary world. But as the animal we have imagined would find himself suddenly new-begotten into a state in which he was conscious of himself and of God, so <span class= "ital">we</span> found ourselves new-begotten into a state of definite and most energetic expectation of whole <span class= "ital">saecula saeculorum</span>--worlds beyond worlds--of bliss before us.<p><span class= "bld">By the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</span>--Mystically speaking, the moment of our emergence into this new glow of expectation was that when the Messiah Jesus, who had been cut off, emerged from among the dead. <span class= "ital">Then</span> we saw it all! St. Peter, indeed, is speaking, so far as himself was concerned, not mystically, but literally, as his history before and after the Resurrection shows. To him, and to the other Apostles, the Resurrection was a regeneration, and they became new beings. To subsequent Christians precisely the same effect takes place when (suddenly or gradually) the fact of the Resurrection is acknowledged and its significance realised. (See what St. Paul says, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm" title="That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death;">Philippians 3:10</a>.) Yet we must not confine the meaning of the words to the effects of this conscious realisation. St. Peter is viewing the transaction theologically, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>from God's point of view, not phenomenally, from man's. He speaks of the begetting, not of the being born--of the Resurrection itself, not of the preaching of the Resurrection. To God, with whom, according to St. Peter, time does not exist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-8.htm" title="But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.">2Peter 3:8</a>), there is no interval between His begetting of Christ again from the dead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-33.htm" title="God has fulfilled the same to us their children, in that he has raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you.">Acts 13:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-5.htm" title="And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. To him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,">Revelation 1:5</a>), and His begetting of us again thereby. In the mystery of our union with the Incarnate Word, His historical resurrection <span class= "ital">did, </span>through baptism, in some ineffable manner, infuse into us the grace which makes new creatures of us. Archbishop Leighton says well, "Not only is it (the Resurrection) the exemplar, but the efficient cause of our new birth." (See below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm" title="The like figure whereunto even baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:">1Peter 3:21</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm" title="Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.">Romans 6:4</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> The Greek word rendered "blessed" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) is used by the New Testament writers only of God; the participle <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is said of men. St. Peter adopts the doxology used by St. Paul in writing to the Churches at Corinth and Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>), the last being one of those to which this Epistle is addressed. It is a question whether the genitive, "of our Lord Jesus Christ," depends on both substantives or only on the last. The Greek will admit either view, and there are high authorities on both sides. On the whole, the first seems the most natural interpretation. The Lord himself had said, "I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>). He could not say, "our God," for the relations are widely different; he could say, "my God," as he had said upon the cross; for, in the well-known words of Theophylact, "he is both the God and the Father of one and the same Christ; his God, as of Christ manifest in the flesh; his Father, as of God the Word." So St. Paul, after using this same form of salutation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>, speaks of God in the seventeenth verse as "the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory" (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-6.htm">Romans 15:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-31.htm">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-3.htm">Colossians 1:3</a>). Which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead; rather, <span class="accented">begat</span>, as in the Revised Version. St. Peter refers our regeneration back to the great fact of the resurrection of Christ. The Lord Jesus Christ is "the First-begotten of the dead" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>); we are "buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>). The Church, "which is his body" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>), died with him in his death, rose with him in his resurrection. Christians individually are baptized into his death, "that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>). The resurrection of Christ was in a real sense the birth of the Church. Therefore St. Peter, who in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a> speaks so strongly of the effect of holy baptism, here refers oar regeneration to that without which baptism would be an empty ceremony, the resurrection of our Lord. God's great mercy (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4, 5</a>, "God, who is rich in mercy.... hath <span class="accented">quickened</span> us together with Christ") is the first cause of our new birth, Christ's resurrection is the means through which it was accomplished. St. Peter alone of the New Testament writers uses the word here rendered "hath begotten again" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); it occurs also in ver. 23. But our Lord himself, and his apostles St. James and St. Paul, teach the same truth to similar words (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-18.htm">James 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>). Some commentators, as Luther, Bengel, etc., connect the words, "by the resurrection," etc., not with "hath begotten us again," but with the word "<span class="accented">lively"</span> or "living" - a hope that liveth through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. This connection is grammatically possible, and gives a good and true meaning; it is the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ which makes the Christian's hope living and strong; but the other explanation seems more natural, and is supported by such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-25.htm">Romans 4:25</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a> of this Epistle. The heavenly inheritance is the ultimate end of our regeneration; the hope of that inheritance is the present joy of the Christian life. St. Paul reminds the Ephesian Christians that when they were without Christ they had no hope (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>); but God according to his great mercy begat us again into a new life, and one important aspect of that new life is hope, the hope of ever-deepening fellowship with God now, of everlasting life with God in heaven. That hope is living; it is "pervaded with life, carrying with it in undying power the certainty of fulfillment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-5.htm">Romans 5:5</a>), and making the heart joyful and happy." (Huther); "it has life in itself, and gives life, and has life as its object" (De Wette). And it liveth, it doth not perish like the hopes of this world, but it lives on in ever fuller joy till it reaches its consummation in heaven; even there "hope <span class="accented">abideth</span>," <span class="accented">forever</span> in heaven there will be, it seems, a continual progress from glory to glory, nearer and nearer to the throne. St. Peter is the apostle of hope. "<span class="accented">He</span> loves," <span class="accented">says</span> Bengel, "the epithet living, and the mention of hope." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-9 This epistle is addressed to believers in general, who are strangers in every city or country where they live, and are scattered through the nations. These are to ascribe their salvation to the electing love of the Father, the redemption of the Son, and the sanctification of the Holy Ghost; and so to give glory to one God in three Persons, into whose name they had been baptized. Hope, in the world's phrase, refers only to an uncertain good, for all worldly hopes are tottering, built upon sand, and the worldling's hopes of heaven are blind and groundless conjectures. But the hope of the sons of the living God is a living hope; not only as to its object, but as to its effect also. It enlivens and comforts in all distresses, enables to meet and get over all difficulties. Mercy is the spring of all this; yea, great mercy and manifold mercy. And this well-grounded hope of salvation, is an active and living principle of obedience in the soul of the believer. The matter of a Christian's joy, is the remembrance of the happiness laid up for him. It is incorruptible, it cannot come to nothing, it is an estate that cannot be spent. Also undefiled; this signifies its purity and perfection. And it fadeth not; is not sometimes more or less pleasant, but ever the same, still like itself. All possessions here are stained with defects and failings; still something is wanting: fair houses have sad cares flying about the gilded and ceiled roofs; soft beds and full tables, are often with sick bodies and uneasy stomachs. All possessions are stained with sin, either in getting or in using them. How ready we are to turn the things we possess into occasions and instruments of sin, and to think there is no liberty or delight in their use, without abusing them! Worldly possessions are uncertain and soon pass away, like the flowers and plants of the field. That must be of the greatest worth, which is laid up in the highest and best place, in heaven. Happy are those whose hearts the Holy Spirit sets on this inheritance. God not only gives his people grace, but preserves them unto glory. Every believer has always something wherein he may greatly rejoice; it should show itself in the countenance and conduct. The Lord does not willingly afflict, yet his wise love often appoints sharp trials, to show his people their hearts, and to do them good at the latter end. Gold does not increase by trial in the fire, it becomes less; but faith is made firm, and multiplied, by troubles and afflictions. Gold must perish at last, and can only purchase perishing things, while the trial of faith will be found to praise, and honour, and glory. Let this reconcile us to present afflictions. Seek then to believe Christ's excellence in himself, and his love to us; this will kindle such a fire in the heart as will make it rise up in a sacrifice of love to him. And the glory of God and our own happiness are so united, that if we sincerely seek the one now, we shall attain the other when the soul shall no more be subject to evil. The certainty of this hope is as if believers had already received it.</body></html>
