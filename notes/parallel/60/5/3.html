There is a sense in which the heads of the Church are, and ought to be, lords and princes over the rest; but this is very different from "lording it," acting tyrannically, forgetting the constitutional rights of their subjects.<p><span class= "bld">Over God's heritage.</span>--Quite literally, <span class= "ital">Over the lots.</span> The word first of all means (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-35.htm" title="And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and on my clothing did they cast lots.">Matthew 27:35</a> or <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-26.htm" title="And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.">Acts 1:26</a>) the actual scrap of paper or wood that was tossed. Then it comes to mean (like the word "lot" in the language of auctions) the piece of property that falls by lot to any one's share. Then all notion of <span class= "ital">chance</span> disappears, and it comes to mean the portion assigned to any one. So St. Peter says that Simon Magus has "no share nor lot in this thing" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-21.htm" title="You have neither part nor lot in this matter: for your heart is not right in the sight of God.">Acts 8:21</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-18.htm" title="To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.">Acts 26:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-12.htm" title=" Giving thanks to the Father, which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:">Colossians 1:12</a>, the same word is rendered "inheritance." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-4.htm" title="And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.">Acts 17:4</a>, our version endeavours, not very successfully, through the Latin word "consorted," to keep up the underlying notion of the Greek, which literally is "were <span class= "ital">allotted</span> to Paul and Silas." Here, therefore, we must understand "the lots," over which the clergy are not to lord it, to be the different congregations, districts, parishes, dioceses, which had been allotted to them. At the same time it does not at all imply that any process like drawing of lots had been resorted to in their appointment, as is seen from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-4.htm" title="And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.">Acts 17:4</a>, just cited. It will be seen that our version is misleading in substituting singular for plural, and in inserting the word "God's." The whole flock is God's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-2.htm" title="Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;">1Peter 5:2</a>), purchased with His own blood; but the "allotments" are the portions assigned by Him to the different clergy. It is some consolation to see, when we groan under the lives and characters of some church officers now, that even in the Apostles' days cowardice, greed, and self-assertion were not unknown.<p><span class= "bld">Ensamples to the flock.</span>--The best way of becoming a real prince and lord over men is to show them by example what they ought to do, like Chaucer's Parson, who--<p>"Cristes lore and hys Apostlis twelve<p>He taught, but fyrst hee practys'd it himselve."<p>Leighton well quotes from Nazianzen: "Either teach not, or teach by living."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither as being lords over God's heritage</span>; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b5;</span> verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> is not only intensive, it implies something of scorn and tyranny or even of hostility, as also in <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-6.htm">James 2:6</a>); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-25.htm">Matthew 20:25</a>. The literal rendering of the clause is, "lording it over the lots." The Authorized Version, following Beza, supplies <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "God's heritage." But if this were the apostle's meaning, he would surely have used the singular, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "the lot or portion of God;" and it is very unlikely that he would have left the most important word to be supplied. Some commentators take <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> in its modern sense, of the clergy, as if St. Peter was commanding the bishops not to tyrannize over the inferior clergy. But this view involves an anachronism; the word had not acquired this meaning in St. Peter's time. It is clearly best to understand it of the lots or portions assigned to individual presbyters. The word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> originally meant a "lot" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-35.htm">Matthew 27:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>), then portions assigned by casting lots, as the possessions of the tribes of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18.htm">Joshua 18</a> and 19), then any portion or inheritance however obtained; thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-9.htm">Deuteronomy 10:9</a> the Lord is said to be the Inheritance <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of the Levites. In later times the word was applied to the clergy, who were regarded as, in a special sense, the Lord's portion or inheritance, perhaps because God was pleased to take the tribe of Levi instead of the firstborn, saying, the Levites shall be mine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-12.htm">Numbers 3:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But being ensamples to the flock</span>; literally, <span class="accented">becoming examples</span>. They must imitate the great Example, the Lord Jesus, and, by gradual imitation of his blessed character, become examples themselves. Thus they will acquire a more salutary influence and a truer authority. "The life should command, and the tongue persuade" (Athanasius, quoted by Fronmuller). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-4 The apostle Peter does not command, but exhorts. He does not claim power to rule over all pastors and churches. It was the peculiar honour of Peter and a few more, to be witnesses of Christ's sufferings; but it is the privilege of all true Christians to partake of the glory that shall be revealed. These poor, dispersed, suffering Christians, were the flock of God, redeemed to God by the great Shepherd, living in holy love and communion, according to the will of God. They are also dignified with the title of God's heritage or clergy; his peculiar lot, chosen for his own people, to enjoy his special favour, and to do him special service. Christ is the chief Shepherd of the whole flock and heritage of God. And all faithful ministers will receive a crown of unfading glory, infinitely better and more honourable than all the authority, wealth, and pleasure of the world.</body></html>
