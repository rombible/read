The exiled Israel in this wicked capital feels for you. Love and peace be among you.<p>(12) <span class= "bld">By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose.</span>--There is not any reason for doubting that this is the same as the Silas of the Acts and the Silvanus of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-19.htm" title="For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yes and no, but in him was yes.">2Corinthians 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.">1Thessalonians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:">2Thessalonians 1:1</a>. It is not a common name, and nothing would suggest the doubt, except the acceptance a <span class= "ital">priori</span> of the Tbingen theory, that the feud between St. Peter and St. Paul was so deadly as to preclude the possibility of the first giving his patronage to a friend of the second. We have already seen repeatedly how false that theory is. That the bearer of this Letter was a personage of great consideration, may be seen from the fact that St. Peter speaks of him as well known throughout the whole Hebrew population of Asia Minor. In the original the testimony is still more marked than in our version, as it has the definite article, "<span class= "ital">the, </span>or <span class= "ital">that, </span>faithful brother unto you." Silas being of the circumcision himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-22.htm" title="Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:">Acts 15:22</a>), St. Peter can without any risk, writing to the Jews, call him "brother." And since there was probably some disaffection towards him among the Jewish Christians, for the way in which he had sided with St. Paul, St. Peter, the Apostle of the circumcision, adds it as his own personal conviction that Silas was no false brother to the Hebrew Christians, by saying, "as I reckon." The words "as I suppose" (or, rather, <span class= "ital">as I reckon</span>) do not imply any uncertainty on St. Peter's part, nor even that St. Peter's knowledge of Silas was less intimate than that of the persons to whom he writes. It means, rather, the most complete confidence in Silas, which the writer is not at all ashamed to declare--"that faithful brother unto you, in my estimation, if my conviction is worth anything." This only shows that St. Peter had not altered his opinion either of Silas or of the relative positions of Jew and Gentile in the Church, since that great council in which he took so prominent a part, when Silas was selected, no doubt because of his uniting liberal views with steadfast allegiance to the Law, to bear the apostolic mandates to the Gentile metropolis of Antioch. The same qualifications which fitted him for that work, would now again serve him in good stead to bear to the Jews of Asia Minor St. Peter's countersignature to the doctrine of St. Paul. At the same time the expression, "that faithful brother unto you," indicates that St. Silas had been himself working in Asia Minor. Of his history nothing is recorded subsequent to his labours with St. Paul at Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-5.htm" title="And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.">Acts 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-19.htm" title="For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yes and no, but in him was yes.">2Corinthians 1:19</a>); but putting together the fact that he is not included in the list of St. Paul's companions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>, with what is implied by this present passage, we might naturally infer that he was left at Ephesus, and devoted himself to the evangelisation of the Asiatic provinces.<p><span class= "bld">Briefly.</span>--So <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-22.htm" title="And I beseech you, brothers, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter to you in few words.">Hebrews 13:22</a>. The writer hints that if this present Letter is not enough to effect its purpose, it is not because there is any lack of matter or weakness of conviction. (See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-25.htm" title="The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the LORD. But he said to them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.">John 20:25</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.</span>--These words give St. Peter's own account of the object and contents of the Epistle. The "exhortation" involves all that was mentioned in the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-1.htm" title="The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:">1Peter 5:1</a>. The word for "testifying" has a little further force than appears in our version; it is "bearing witness <span class= "ital">thereto.</span>" The fact had been <span class= "ital">alleged</span> by others; St. Peter comes in as evidence to its truth. Literally it would run: "that this is true grace (or, <span class= "ital">a true grace</span>) of God"; <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>that the position which they now occupy, through the preaching of the gospel, is indeed one which the favour of God had brought them into: it was no fictitious grace, no robbing of them under pretence of bringing them glad tidings. When he says "this," he seems to mean "this of which I have spoken," "this which has formed the subject of my Letter." And the best text pursues; "wherein stand ye," or "whereupon take up your stand." Thus the very sentence itself would contain the two elements of the Letter--"exhorting" as well as "testifying." Nothing is to drive them or entice them from the ground which the Pauline preachers have marked out for them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly</span>; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">by Silvanus</span>, <span class="accented">our faithful brother</span>, <span class="accented">as I account him</span>, <span class="accented">I have written unto you briefly</span>. The preposition "by" <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> has the same sense as <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-23.htm">Acts 15:23</a>. Silvanus was the bearer of the Epistle; he may have been the amanuensis also. In all probability he is the Silas of the Acts of the Apostles, and the Silvanus whose name St. Paul associates with his own in the address of both Epistles to the Thessalonians; he is mentioned also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-19.htm">2 Corinthians 1:19</a>. As the companion of St. Paul, he must have been known to the Churches of Asia Minor. The word rendered in the Authorized Version "I suppose" <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> does not imply any doubt (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-28.htm">Romans 3:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-19.htm">Hebrews 11:19</a>). The Christians of Asia Minor knew Silvanus as a faithful brother; St. Peter adds his testimony. Some connect it with the clause, "<span class="accented">I</span> have written unto you briefly," as if St. Peter meant to say that he regarded his letter as a short one, the subjects being so important; but this does not seem natural. It is better to take the pronoun <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, unto you, with the verb "I have written," than with the words, "a faithful brother," as in the Authorized Version. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span> is the epistolary aorist, and may therefore be rendered "I write." <span class="cmt_word">Exhorting, and testifying</span>. The general tone of this Epistle is hortatory: St. Peter comforts his readers in the sufferings which were coming on them, and exhorts them to patient endurance. The word rendered "testifying" <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> occurs only here in the New Testament. Bengel and others take the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> in the sense of <span class="accented">insuper</span>, in "addition:" "Petrus insuper testatur;" he adds his testimony to that of Paul and others who have gone before; or, he not only exhorts, he also testifies - the testimony is in addition to the exhortation. But more probably the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> is intensive, or expresses simply the direction of the testifying (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1.htm">Acts 1</a>:40, where the same words nearly; the Greek for "testified" is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> are used in describing St. Peter's exhortations). <span class="cmt_word">That this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand</span>; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">that this is the true grace of God: stand ye fast therein</span>. The reading <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is supported by the oldest manuscripts. The construction involves a common ellipse, "Into which (having entered) stand fast." Some think that it was St. Peter's intention in these words to set the seal of his apostolic authority upon the truth of the teaching which the Christians of Asia Minor had received from St. Paul. It may be so. The whole Epistle corroborates the teaching of St. Paul, and shows St. Peter's exact agreement with it. But it seems probable that, if St. Peter had thought it necessary to give a formal sanction to St. Paul's preaching, he would have done so plainly, as he does at the end of the Second Epistle. Again, there are no traces in the Epistle of any doubts now existing in the minds of the Asiatic Christians, or of any opposition to St. Paul, such as there once had been in the Churches of Corinth and Galatia. And St. Peter does not say, "These are the true doctrines," but "This is the true grace of God." He seems rather to be giving the testimony o&pound; his knowledge and spiritual experience to the fact that the grace which they had received came indeed from God, that it was his true grace, that it was he who was working within them both to will and to do. They must stand fast in that grace, and by its help work out their own salvation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:10-14 In conclusion, the apostle prays to God for them, as the God of all grace. Perfect implies their progress towards perfection. Stablish imports the curing of our natural lightness and inconstancy. Strengthen has respect to the growth of graces, especially where weakest and lowest. Settle signifies to fix upon a sure foundation, and may refer to Him who is the Foundation and Strength of believers. These expressions show that perseverance and progress in grace are first to be sought after by every Christian. The power of these doctrines on the hearts, and the fruits in the lives, showed who are partakers of the grace of God. The cherishing and increase of Christian love, and of affection one to another, is no matter of empty compliment, but the stamp and badge of Jesus Christ on his followers. Others may have a false peace for a time, and wicked men may wish for it to themselves and to one another; but theirs is a vain hope, and will come to nought. All solid peace is founded on Christ, and flows from him.</body></html>
