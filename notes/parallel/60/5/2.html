It is the verb used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-16.htm" title="He said to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Feed my sheep.">John 21:16</a>, not that in the 15th and 17th verses. There can be hardly any doubt that St. Peter was thinking of that scene when he issued these directions. Our Lord had committed into his hands all His sheep and lambs, without restriction of age or country, to be fed and shepherded; and now the time was approaching when he would have to "put off this tabernacle" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-14.htm" title="Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ has showed me.">2Peter 1:14</a>), and he here takes order that "after his decease" the charge committed to him. may be fulfilled. He still shepherds the flock by proxy. Two other points must be mentioned, which bring this passage into connection with the charge given by St. Paul to the Ephesian elders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>), which was very probably known to St. Peter. (1) St. Peter calls it "the flock <span class= "ital">of God.</span>" Textual critics are much divided on the reading in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>, but, on the whole, the Received reading seems the best supported: "the Church of God which He hath purchased with His own blood." At the same time, St. Peter is in remembrance how Christ had said, "Feed <span class= "ital">My</span> sheep." It may be fairly thought, therefore, when we see St. Peter's own theology in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-25.htm" title="But the word of the Lord endures for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached to you.">1Peter 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-3.htm" title="If so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.">1Peter 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-15.htm" title="But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:">1Peter 3:15</a>, that when he writes, "Feed the flock <span class= "ital">of God," </span>his thoughts turn to the Second Person of the Holy Trinity rather than to the First. (2) Hooker well points out, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>, the <span class= "ital">unity</span> of the flock. Though there were many elders in Ephesus, there was but one flock they fed between them. So now, all over Asia Minor, it was but one flock. St. Peter, to whom the flock throughout the whole world was committed, saw it as a whole, but the elders to whom he writes had only to look to that part of the one flock which was "among them." The marginal rendering is against the order of the Greek words, and does not suit the context so well when the context is rightly understood.<p><span class= "bld">Taking the oversight thereof</span>.--It is exceedingly doubtful whether these words form part of the original text or not. If they do, the translation unduly limits the meaning, which would be better expressed by "maintaining (or, <span class= "ital">exercising</span>) the oversight," or "performing the duties of bishops," for he is addressing men who were already ordained. By this time the word "bishop" had not become a fixed title of one special office, though the office itself was in existence.<p><span class= "bld">Not by constraint, but willingly.</span>--Why should this exhortation be given so prominently? It is hardly to be thought that St. Peter had in view the humility which led men to adopt such strange methods of avoiding the responsibility of the priesthood as we find resorted to by Chrysostom and Ambrose. Much more probably he is thinking of the actual <span class= "ital">danger</span> to life and property of being "ringleaders of the sect" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-5.htm" title="For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:">Acts 24:5</a>), which would lead cowardly bishops to throw up their office. He is not treating of the motives which should lead a man to accept the position. He speaks to persons who already <span class= "ital">hold</span> the office, and urges them not to leave the flock, like hirelings, when they see the persecution coming on. Several of the best authorities add," but willingly, according to God." It was God, that is, who put them in that station, and they must not need the compulsion of their laity, or of the rest of the episcopate, or of the Apostles, to keep them at their post.<p><span class= "bld">Not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind.</span>--The opposite vice to that on which he has just passed sentence. Some, who had no fears, might be tempted to retain the office by the good salary which the Church gave, or might threaten to resign if their salaries were not raised in proportion to their risk. The "ready mind," of which the Apostle speaks, means the love of the work itself, which should be the sole motive in seeking, or performing, the gospel ministry.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Feed the flock of God which is among you</span>; rather, <span class="accented">tend</span>, as a shepherd tends his flock. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is aorist, as if St. Peter wished to concentrate into one point of view all the labors of the ministerial life. He is echoing the word so solemnly addressed to himself by the risen Lord, "Feed my sheep <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>." The word covers all the various duties of the pastoral office: "Pasce mente, pasce ore, pasce operc, pasce animi oratione, verbi exhortatione, exempli exhibitione" (St. Bernard, quoted by Alford). St. Peter lays stress upon the solemn fact that the flock belongs to God, not to the shepherds (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>). Some understand the words rendered "which is among you <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> " as meaning" quantum in vobis est," "<span class="accented">as</span> far as lies in your power." Others as "<span class="accented">that</span> which is committed to you," or "that which is placed under your care." But the simple local meaning seems the best. <span class="cmt_word">Taking the oversight thereof.</span> This word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is not found in the Sinaitic and Vatican Manuscripts. Alford thinks that "it has, perhaps, been removed for ecclesiastical reasons, for fear <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> should be supposed to be, as they really were, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> It is in the Alexandrine and most other ancient manuscripts and versions, and there seems to be no sufficient reason for omitting it. It shows that when this Epistle was written, the words <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, presbyter and bishop, were still synonymous (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-17.htm">Acts 20:17</a> and 28 in the Greek; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a> and 7). <span class="cmt_word">Not by constraint, but willingly</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, by constraint, occurs only here. St. Paul says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-16.htm">1 Corinthians 9:16</a>), "Necessity is laid upon me;" but that was an inward necessity, the constraining love of Christ. Bede, quoted by Alford, <span class="accented">says</span>, "Coacte pascit gregem, qui propter rerum temporalium penurium non habens unde vivat, idcirco praedicat evangelium ut de evangelio vivere possit." Some good manuscripts add, after "willingly," the words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "according to God," i.e. according to his will (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-27.htm">Romans 8:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Not for filthy lucre.</span> The adverb <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> occurs only here (for the thought, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-8.htm">1 Timothy 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-7.htm">Titus 1:7</a>). It would seem that, even in the apostolic age, there were sometimes such opportunities of gain (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-11.htm">Titus 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-6.htm">2 Timothy 3:6</a>) as to be a temptation to enter the ministry for the sake of money. St. Peter uses a strong word in condemnation of such a motive. <span class="cmt_word">But of a ready mind.</span> This adverb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> occurs nowhere else in the New Testament; it has a stronger meaning than the preceding word <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, willingly; it implies zeal and enthusiasm. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-4 The apostle Peter does not command, but exhorts. He does not claim power to rule over all pastors and churches. It was the peculiar honour of Peter and a few more, to be witnesses of Christ's sufferings; but it is the privilege of all true Christians to partake of the glory that shall be revealed. These poor, dispersed, suffering Christians, were the flock of God, redeemed to God by the great Shepherd, living in holy love and communion, according to the will of God. They are also dignified with the title of God's heritage or clergy; his peculiar lot, chosen for his own people, to enjoy his special favour, and to do him special service. Christ is the chief Shepherd of the whole flock and heritage of God. And all faithful ministers will receive a crown of unfading glory, infinitely better and more honourable than all the authority, wealth, and pleasure of the world.</body></html>
