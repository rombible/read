Satan is eyeing all the Christians in turn to see which he has the best chance of, not merely stalking forth vaguely to look for prey.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be sober, be vigilant</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a>). For the first word, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, see note on 1 Peter 4:7. The second <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, is the word so often and so emphatically used by our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-35.htm">Mark 13:35, 37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-40.htm">Matthew 26:40, 41</a>, etc.). The imperatives are aorist, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-7.htm">1 Peter 4:7</a>; and, as there, either imply that the exhortation was needed by the readers, or are used to express vividly the necessity of instant attention. <span class="cmt_word">Because your adversary the devil.</span> The conjunction "because" is omitted in the best manuscripts. The asyndeten, as in the last clause, increases the emphasis. The word rendered "adversary" <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> means properly an opponent in a lawsuit, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-25.htm">Matthew 5:25</a>; but it is also used generally for "adversary," and so is a translation of the Hebrew word <span class="accented">Satan</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, devil, means "slanderer," "false accuser." <span class="cmt_word">As a roaring lion</span>. He is called a serpent to denote his subtlety, a lion to express his fierceness and strength. The word rendered "roaring" <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used especially of the cries of wild beasts when ravenous with hunger (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-21.htm">Psalm 104:21</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-13.htm">Psalm 22:13, 21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Walketh about, seeking whom he may devour</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-7.htm">Job 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-2.htm">Job 2:2</a>). The words express the restless energy of the wicked one. He cannot touch those who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation; but he walketh about, looking eagerly after any lost sheep that may have wandered from the fold. He roars in the craving of his heart for prey, like a hungry lion, seeking whom he may devour, or (for the reading here is somewhat uncertain) to devour some one, or simply to devour. The Greek word means literally "to drink down;" it implies utter destruction. It is the word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54</a>, "Death is swallowed up <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> in victory." Satan now seeks whom he may destroy: "The Lord will destroy him that hath the power of death, that is, the devil" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:5-9 Humility preserves peace and order in all Christian churches and societies; pride disturbs them. Where God gives grace to be humble, he will give wisdom, faith, and holiness. To be humble, and subject to our reconciled God, will bring greater comfort to the soul than the gratification of pride and ambition. But it is to be in due time; not in thy fancied time, but God's own wisely appointed time. Does he wait, and wilt not thou? What difficulties will not the firm belief of his wisdom, power, and goodness get over! Then be humble under his hand. Cast all you care; personal cares, family cares, cares for the present, and cares for the future, for yourselves, for others, for the church, on God. These are burdensome, and often very sinful, when they arise from unbelief and distrust, when they torture and distract the mind, unfit us for duties, and hinder our delight in the service of God. The remedy is, to cast our care upon God, and leave every event to his wise and gracious disposal. Firm belief that the Divine will and counsels are right, calms the spirit of a man. Truly the godly too often forget this, and fret themselves to no purpose. Refer all to God's disposal. The golden mines of all spiritual comfort and good are wholly his, and the Spirit itself. Then, will he not furnish what is fit for us, if we humbly attend on him, and lay the care of providing for us, upon his wisdom and love? The whole design of Satan is to devour and destroy souls. He always is contriving whom he may insnare to eternal ruin. Our duty plainly is, to be sober; to govern both the outward and the inward man by the rules of temperance. To be vigilant; suspicious of constant danger from this spiritual enemy, watchful and diligent to prevent his designs. Be stedfast, or solid, by faith. A man cannot fight upon a quagmire, there is no standing without firm ground to tread upon; this faith alone furnishes. It lifts the soul to the firm advanced ground of the promises, and fixes it there. The consideration of what others suffer, is proper to encourage us to bear our share in any affliction; and in whatever form Satan assaults us, or by whatever means, we may know that our brethren experience the same.</body></html>
