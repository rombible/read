"Stand and face him," instead of running away from posts of duty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-2.htm" title="Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;">1Peter 5:2</a>), or lying still and letting things take their course (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm" title="Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour:">1Peter 5:8</a>). And the words for "stedfast in the faith" seem to mean not only that each individual is to stand firm, but that they are to present all together a solid front to the lion.<p><span class= "bld">Knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.</span>--The phraseology of the original is very strange. The <span class= "ital">sameness</span> of the sufferings is brought out by an expression which literally runs "the same things in the way of sufferings;" the fraternal unity, by the use of the same abstract word which we had in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-17.htm" title="Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.">1Peter 2:17</a>. The verb rendered "to accomplish" sometimes denotes execution or infliction. So the whole will run, <span class= "ital">knowing that the very same things in the way of sufferings are being inflicted upon your brotherhood which is in the world. "</span>There is one thing," says Archbishop Leighton, "that much troubles the patience and weakens the faith of some Christians; they are ready to think there is none, yea, there was never any beloved of God in such a condition as theirs. Therefore the Apostle St. Paul breaks this conceit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-13.htm" title="There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it.">1Corinthians 10:13</a>), 'no temptation hath taken you but such as is common to man:' and here is the same truth, 'the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren.' This is the truth, and, taken altogether, is a most comfortable truth; the whole brotherhood go in this way, and our eldest Brother went first." The addition, "that are in the world," points the suffering Christians indirectly to solace themselves with the thought of that portion of the brotherhood which has got beyond the infliction. It would be possible to translate, though somewhat far-fetched in point of thought, "knowing that the same sufferings (or, <span class= "ital">the identity of the sufferings</span>) is completed by your brotherhood in the world"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>finds a consummation in making closer the bonds of brotherhood between you.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whom resist steadfast in the faith</span>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-7.htm">James 4:7</a>, where the same word, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, is used; the close resemblance seems to indicate St. Peter's knowledge of the Epistle of St. James; comp. also St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a>, etc. The Greek word for "steadfast" <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> is emphatic; it implies solidity, rocklike firmness. Only faith can give that steadfastness - faith in Christ, the one Foundation, the Rock on which the Christian's house is built. Faith here is trustfulness rather than objective truth. Therefore the rendering of the Revised Version seems preferable, "in your faith," the article having, as often, a possessive meaning. <span class="cmt_word">Knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the same</span> (<span class="accented">forms</span>) <span class="accented">of afflictions</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> unusual construction with the pronoun, though common with adjectives, intended to give emphasis; the sufferings were the very same. The infinitive is present; it should therefore be rendered, "are being accomplished." The persecutions were now beginning to break out. The word for "brethren" is the collective, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1fef;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, brotherhood, which we met with in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-17.htm">1 Peter 2:17</a>. The dative is that of reference - "in" or "for" the brotherhood. (For the words, "in the world," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>, "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.") There is another way of taking the clause. The unusual construction (in the Greek Testament) of the accusative and infinitive, which, indeed, occurs nowhere else with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span>, has led Herman and others to take the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> as middle, and to connect the dative, "<span class="accented">for</span> the brotherhood," with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>, the same. Thus the translation will be, "<span class="accented">Knowing</span> how to pay the same tribute of affliction as your brethren in the world." This seems forced and unnecessary. Huther gives another possible translation, which he thinks preferable to all others: "<span class="accented">Knowing</span> [or better rather, 'considering'] that the same sufferings are accomplishing themselves in the brethren." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:5-9 Humility preserves peace and order in all Christian churches and societies; pride disturbs them. Where God gives grace to be humble, he will give wisdom, faith, and holiness. To be humble, and subject to our reconciled God, will bring greater comfort to the soul than the gratification of pride and ambition. But it is to be in due time; not in thy fancied time, but God's own wisely appointed time. Does he wait, and wilt not thou? What difficulties will not the firm belief of his wisdom, power, and goodness get over! Then be humble under his hand. Cast all you care; personal cares, family cares, cares for the present, and cares for the future, for yourselves, for others, for the church, on God. These are burdensome, and often very sinful, when they arise from unbelief and distrust, when they torture and distract the mind, unfit us for duties, and hinder our delight in the service of God. The remedy is, to cast our care upon God, and leave every event to his wise and gracious disposal. Firm belief that the Divine will and counsels are right, calms the spirit of a man. Truly the godly too often forget this, and fret themselves to no purpose. Refer all to God's disposal. The golden mines of all spiritual comfort and good are wholly his, and the Spirit itself. Then, will he not furnish what is fit for us, if we humbly attend on him, and lay the care of providing for us, upon his wisdom and love? The whole design of Satan is to devour and destroy souls. He always is contriving whom he may insnare to eternal ruin. Our duty plainly is, to be sober; to govern both the outward and the inward man by the rules of temperance. To be vigilant; suspicious of constant danger from this spiritual enemy, watchful and diligent to prevent his designs. Be stedfast, or solid, by faith. A man cannot fight upon a quagmire, there is no standing without firm ground to tread upon; this faith alone furnishes. It lifts the soul to the firm advanced ground of the promises, and fixes it there. The consideration of what others suffer, is proper to encourage us to bear our share in any affliction; and in whatever form Satan assaults us, or by whatever means, we may know that our brethren experience the same.</body></html>
