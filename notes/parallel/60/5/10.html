The moment of the call was that when St. Paul and the others first preached there. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1Peter 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-25.htm" title="But the word of the Lord endures for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached to you.">1Peter 1:25</a>, and Notes.) The God who <span class= "ital">now</span> bestows all <span class= "ital">grace, </span>by the giving of that grace calls us into glory.<p>"The men of grace have found<p>Glory begun below."<p><span class= "bld">By Christ Jesus.</span>--On the whole it seems best, with Tischendorf, to drop the name of Jesus out of the text: the title "Christ" will then stand between "the eternal glory," which we possess "in Him" (not "<span class= "ital">by</span> Christ Jesus," as our version has it, but <span class= "ital">by virtue of our union with the Christ</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and the immediate mention of suffering. In Him the two are drawn inseparably together.<p><span class= "bld">Suffered a while.</span>--The Greek says distinctly, "a <span class= "ital">little</span> while," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-6.htm" title="Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, you are in heaviness through manifold temptations:">1Peter 1:6</a>. All time is short in comparison of what comes after. The original looks as if St. Peter meant not only "<span class= "ital">after</span> that ye have suffered," but also "by the fact of your having suffered."<p><span class= "bld">Make you perfect.</span>--Strictly these are futures, "<span class= "ital">shall</span> (or, <span class= "ital">will</span>)<span class= "ital"> make you perfect"</span> &c. This verb occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-10.htm" title="Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?">1Thessalonians 3:10</a>, and elsewhere. It implies the reduction to order and fitness for work of what is disordered or broken. The others, which are all very similar in meaning, are heaped up after St. Peter's manner. Bengel thus explains them: "Make you perfect, that there remain no defect in you. Stablish, that nothing shake you. Strengthen, that you may overcome all force brought against you." The word for "to settle" means "to found," to give a solid foundation. All this is to take place at the close of the short spell of suffering which is the means to it. St. Peter seems, therefore, to contemplate the passing off of the persecution before the end of the world; for these verbs could hardly be so naturally used to express our education in the world to come.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the God of all grace</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3</a>, "the God of all comfort"). St. Peter has finished his exhortations; he has told his readers what they must do; he now bids them look to God, and tells them where they will find strength. God will work within them both to will and to do of his good pleasure; for he is the God of all grace. All that grace by which we are saved, without which we can do nothing, comes from him as its Author and Source. <span class="cmt_word">Who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus</span>; rather, <span class="accented">who called you</span>... <span class="accented">in Christ Jesus</span>. All the best manuscripts read "you" instead of us. Two of the most ancient omit "Jesus" here. God called us "in Christ;" that is, through spiritual union with Christ; the glory is promised to these who are one with Christ; for the glory is Christ's, and his members will share it. The very end and purpose of our calling was that we might inherit that glory. This is the apostle's great topic of consolation. <span class="cmt_word">After that ye have suffered a while</span>; literally, <span class="accented">a little</span>. The word may refer to the degree, as well as to the duration, of the sufferings. They are transient; the glory is eternal. They may seem very severe, but they are light in comparison with that "far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory." <span class="cmt_word">Make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.</span> The manuscripts vary between the future and the optative in these four verbs; the preponderance of evidence seems in favor of the future. The emphatic pronoun <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> must not be omitted. Translate therefore, "shall himself make you perfect." He only can "perfect what is lacking in our faith" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:10</a>, where the same verb is used); and he will do it. This is our hope and encouragement. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> means "to finish, to complete, to repair." It is the word used in the account of the calling of Peter and Andrew, James and John, by the Sea of Galilee, when the two last were in the ship with Zebedee their father, mending <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> their nets. God will repair, bring to completion, what is lacking in the character of his chosen, if they persevere in prayer, if they are sober and vigilant (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>, etc.). <span class="accented">Stablish</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. The Lord had said to St. Peter, "When thou art converted, strengthen <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> thy brethren" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-32.htm">Luke 22:32</a>); Peter remembers his Master's words. <span class="accented">Strengthen</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. The word occurs only here. <span class="accented">Settle</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>; literally, "shall ground you, shall give you a firm foundation." "Digna <span class="accented">Petro</span> oratio, 'Confirmat fratres sues,'" says Bengel (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>). The word is omitted in the Vatican and Alexandrine Manuscripts; but it is found in the Sinaitic and other manuscripts and versions, and ought to be retained. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:10-14 In conclusion, the apostle prays to God for them, as the God of all grace. Perfect implies their progress towards perfection. Stablish imports the curing of our natural lightness and inconstancy. Strengthen has respect to the growth of graces, especially where weakest and lowest. Settle signifies to fix upon a sure foundation, and may refer to Him who is the Foundation and Strength of believers. These expressions show that perseverance and progress in grace are first to be sought after by every Christian. The power of these doctrines on the hearts, and the fruits in the lives, showed who are partakers of the grace of God. The cherishing and increase of Christian love, and of affection one to another, is no matter of empty compliment, but the stamp and badge of Jesus Christ on his followers. Others may have a false peace for a time, and wicked men may wish for it to themselves and to one another; but theirs is a vain hope, and will come to nought. All solid peace is founded on Christ, and flows from him.</body></html>
