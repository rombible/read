The beautiful word for "chief Shepherd" seems to have been invented by St. Peter, and it has been apparently imitated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-20.htm" title="Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,">Hebrews 13:20</a>. How could an office be more honoured than by speaking of Christ as the chief bearer of that office?<p>"<span class= "bld">A crown of glory that fadeth not away.</span>--It might perhaps be more closely, though less beautifully, represented by <span class= "ital">the glorious crown of amaranth, </span>or <span class= "ital">the amaranthine crown of glory.</span> Amaranth is the name of a flower which, like our immortelles, does not lose its colour or form. St. Peter immediately adds "of glory," lest we should think too literally of the wreath of immortelles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when the chief Shepherd shall appear</span>; rather, <span class="accented">is manifested</span>. The word rendered "chief Shepherd" <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> occurs only here; it reminds us of the Lord's description of himself as "the good Shepherd," and of the "great Shepherd of the sheep" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-20.htm">Hebrews 13:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away</span>. This is the true reward of the faithful presbyter, not power or filthy lucre. Literally, it is "the crown of glory," the promised glory, the glory of the Lord which he hath promised to his chosen. "The glory which thou gavest me, I have given them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-22.htm">John 17:22</a>). The crown is the glory; the genitive seems to be one of apposition. The Greek word here rendered "that fadeth not away" <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is not exactly the same with that so rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a> <span class="greek">&#x3a7;&#x3a7;&#x3a7;</span>; taken literally, the words used here mean an amaranthine wreath - a wreath of amaranth flowers; the general meaning remains the same, "unfading." St. Peter is thinking, not of a kingly crown, but of the wreaths worn on festive occasions or bestowed on conquerors. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-4 The apostle Peter does not command, but exhorts. He does not claim power to rule over all pastors and churches. It was the peculiar honour of Peter and a few more, to be witnesses of Christ's sufferings; but it is the privilege of all true Christians to partake of the glory that shall be revealed. These poor, dispersed, suffering Christians, were the flock of God, redeemed to God by the great Shepherd, living in holy love and communion, according to the will of God. They are also dignified with the title of God's heritage or clergy; his peculiar lot, chosen for his own people, to enjoy his special favour, and to do him special service. Christ is the chief Shepherd of the whole flock and heritage of God. And all faithful ministers will receive a crown of unfading glory, infinitely better and more honourable than all the authority, wealth, and pleasure of the world.</body></html>
