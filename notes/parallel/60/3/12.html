The sense that the Lord's eyes are over you is a sufficient reason for self-restraint under provocation: especially, perhaps, when we see that by "the Lord" St. Peter understands Jesus Christ. That this is the case is clear from his use of the same Psalm in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-3.htm" title="If so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.">1Peter 2:3</a>. If Christ, the model of meekness under persecution (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-23.htm" title="Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judges righteously:">1Peter 2:23</a>), is watching, we not only <span class= "ital">need</span> no passionate self-defence, but should be ashamed to use it. Was St. Peter thinking how once, while he himself was cursing and swearing at those who accused him of being a Christian, he felt the eyes of the Lord turn upon him? The thought of His eyes being over Us is chiefly that of guardianship.<p><span class= "bld">Open unto their prayers.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">are towards their prayer</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>directed towards it. Here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-3.htm" title="If so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.">1Peter 2:3</a>, the Prayer Book version has influenced our translation.<p><span class= "bld">Against them that do evil.</span>--There is no difference in the Greek between this preposition and that just rendered "over." <span class= "ital">But the countenance of the Lord is over them that do evil things.</span> He <span class= "ital">marks</span> what they are doing. This is sufficient comfort when men injure us (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-23.htm" title="Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judges righteously:">1Peter 2:23</a>); sufficient warning not to injure in return. It is instructive now to turn and see the circumstances in which this lovely Psalm was composed. The moment was one of David's extremest peril among an infuriated heathen population. The danger and dread he was in are shown in Psalms 56. Yet nothing can be brighter and more serene than Psalms 34. He had obtained life and days; and it was all through confidence in God on the one hand, and inoffensive self-submission on the other. Had he used violence--"shown spirit," as we say--like the "young lions," he would have come worse off. It seems to be for this cause that St. Peter deemed the Psalm so appropriate to his readers, misjudged and suspiciously watched (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/56-5.htm" title="Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil.">Psalm 56:5-6</a>) by unbelievers, who only waited the opportunity to shed their blood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/56-1.htm" title="Be merciful to me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresses me.">Psalm 56:1-2</a>). But the striking change is that, whereas David's trust in Jehovah was a trust simply in the Eternal Being without distinction of Persons, St. Peter bids the Hebrews of Asia read that Psalm into an act of faith in Jesus. We shall see the same thing in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-15.htm" title="But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:">1Peter 3:15</a>, as we saw it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-3.htm" title="If so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.">1Peter 2:3</a>. The force of the change will be felt by any one who reads through that Psalm, substituting (like the Rheims version) "our Lord" for "the Lord."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers.</span> The apostle adds the conjunction "for" (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, because) to mark the connection. God's people must turn away from evil and do good, because the all-seeing eye is upon them; they will find strength to do so, because God heareth prayer. Perhaps when the apostle was writing these words he remembered how once "the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter." <span class="cmt_word">But the face of the <span class="accented">Lord</span> is against them that do evil.</span> The preposition in the two clauses is the same (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, over, or upon). The Lord's eye is upon the good and the evil. The apostle omits the words that follow in the psalm, "to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth," perhaps because he wishes us to regard the spiritual rather than the temporal consequences of our actions. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:8-13 Though Christians cannot always be exactly of the same mind, yet they should have compassion one of another, and love as brethren. If any man desires to live comfortably on earth, or to possess eternal life in heaven, he must bridle his tongue from wicked, abusive, or deceitful words. He must forsake and keep far from evil actions, do all the good he can, and seek peace with all men. For God, all-wise and every where present, watches over the righteous, and takes care of them. None could or should harm those who copied the example of Christ, who is perfect goodness, and did good to others as his followers.</body></html>
