In any case, the words "as of evil doers" should be removed.<p><span class= "bld">They may be ashamed</span> (or, <span class= "ital">confounded</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span>--When?

Still, it is not so. Other Hebrews, he reminds them in this word, were safe from persecution only by rejecting the national hope of a Messiah. It is simply because these men are "in Christ" that the heathens (perhaps also their fellow Jews) insult their conversation. The phrase "in Christ," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as members of the Church, occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-10.htm" title="But the God of all grace, who has called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that you have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you.">1Peter 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-14.htm" title="Greet you one another with a kiss of charity.

This is the true God, and eternal life.">1John 5:20</a>), but it does not come in 2 Peter, nor in Hebrews, St. James, or St. Jude. Of course, St. Paul's writings teem with it. It contains the converse side of the Incarnation doctrine to that involved in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-15.htm" title="But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:">1Peter 3:15</a>; we not only have the whole Christ dwelling in us, but He embraces us all; "Ye in me, and I in you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-20.htm" title="At that day you shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.">John 14:20</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Having a good conscience</span>. This word "conscience" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) is one of the many links between this Epistle and the writings of St. Paul. St. Peter uses it three times; St. Paul, very frequently. There is a close connection between this clause and the preceding verse. A good conscience is the best reason of the hope that is in us. An apology may be learned, well-expressed, eloquent; but it will not be convincing unless it comes from the heart, and is backed up by the life. Calvin (quoted by Huther) says, "Quid parum auctoritatis habet sermo absque vita." <span class="cmt_word">That, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers.</span> The Revised Version follows the Sinaitic Manuscript in reading, "Wherein ye are spoken against," and omitting "as of evil-doers? It is possible that the received reading may have been interpolated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>, where the same words occur; except that there the mood is indicative, here, conjunctive, "wherein they may possibly speak evil of you." <span class="cmt_word">They may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ</span>; rather, as the Revised Version, <span class="accented">they may be put to shame</span>; that is, "proved to be liars" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-14.htm">2 Corinthians 7:14</a>). The word translated "falsely accuse" is that which is rendered "despitefully use" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-28.htm">Luke 6:28</a>. It is a strong word. Aristotle defines the corresponding substantive as a thwarting of the wishes of others out of gratuitous malice ('Rhet.,' 2:2). For "good conversation," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15, 18</a>. The Christian's life is in Christ, in the sphere of his presence, he dwelling in us, and we in him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:14-22 We sanctify God before others, when our conduct invites and encourages them to glorify and honour him. What was the ground and reason of their hope? We should be able to defend our religion with meekness, in the fear of God. There is no room for any other fears where this great fear is; it disturbs not. The conscience is good, when it does its office well. That person is in a sad condition on whom sin and suffering meet: sin makes suffering extreme, comfortless, and destructive. Surely it is better to suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing, whatever our natural impatience at times may suggest. The example of Christ is an argument for patience under sufferings. In the case of our Lord's suffering, he that knew no sin, suffered instead of those who knew no righteousness. The blessed end and design of our Lord's sufferings were, to reconcile us to God, and to bring us to eternal glory. He was put to death in respect of his human nature, but was quickened and raised by the power of the Holy Spirit. If Christ could not be freed from sufferings, why should Christians think to be so? God takes exact notice of the means and advantages people in all ages have had. As to the old world, Christ sent his Spirit; gave warning by Noah. But though the patience of God waits long, it will cease at last. And the spirits of disobedient sinners, as soon as they are out of their bodies, are committed to the prison of hell, where those that despised Noah's warning now are, and from whence there is no redemption. Noah's salvation in the ark upon the water, which carried him above the floods, set forth the salvation of all true believers. That temporal salvation by the ark was a type of the eternal salvation of believers by baptism of the Holy Spirit. To prevent mistakes, the apostle declares what he means by saving baptism; not the outward ceremony of washing with water, which, in itself, does no more than put away the filth of the flesh, but that baptism, of which the baptismal water formed the sign. Not the outward ordinance, but when a man, by the regeneration of the Spirit, was enabled to repent and profess faith, and purpose a new life, uprightly, and as in the presence of God. Let us beware that we rest not upon outward forms. Let us learn to look on the ordinances of God spiritually, and to inquire after the spiritual effect and working of them on our consciences. We would willingly have all religion reduced to outward things. But many who were baptized, and constantly attended the ordinances, have remained without Christ, died in their sins, and are now past recovery. Rest not then till thou art cleansed by the Spirit of Christ and the blood of Christ. His resurrection from the dead is that whereby we are assured of purifying and peace.</body></html>
