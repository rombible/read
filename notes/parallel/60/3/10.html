The Apostle asks, Who cares to have a life <span class= "ital">worth having, </span>a life which makes a man <span class= "ital">glad to live?</span> This is the "blessing" spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-9.htm" title="Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that you are thereunto called, that you should inherit a blessing.">1Peter 3:9</a>--not simply everlasting life, but a life of unruffled happiness. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/133-3.htm" title="As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended on the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for ever more.">Psalm 133:3</a>.) This healthy enjoyment of life, the opposite of a morbid craving for death (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-17.htm" title="Therefore I hated life; because the work that is worked under the sun is grievous to me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 2:17</a>), is implied to be competent for any person to attain who "wills."<p>"Serene will be our days, and bright,<p>And happy will our nature be,<p>When love is an unerring light,<p>And joy its own security."<p><span class= "bld">See good days.</span>--"See" in the same sense as--<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-13.htm" title="I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.">Psalm 27:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-3.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.">John 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-5.htm" title="By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.">Hebrews 11:5</a>--for to "experience"--consciously to enjoy or to suffer, as the case may be.<p><span class= "bld">Let him refrain.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">let him stop.</span> The evil word is on the very tip of his tongue.<p><span class= "bld">No guile.</span>--"Guile" is often used, in a very wide sense, of almost anything wrong (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-22.htm" title="Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:">1Peter 2:22</a>); but here, probably, the distinction is that "evil" means open railing and bitter speech, while "guile" may mean the words which are "softer than butter, having war in his heart" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-21.htm" title="The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.">Psalm 55:21</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he that will love life</span>; literally, <span class="accented">he that willeth to love life.</span> St. Peter deviates somewhat from the Septuagint Version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-12.htm">Psalm 34:12-16</a>, which he is quoting. The literal rendering of it is, "What man is he that desireth life, loving good days?" His connection of the participle <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span> is remarkable. Perhaps the meaning is best given by Bengel, "Qui vult ita vivere, nt ipsum non taedeat vitro" - " Who wishes to live so that he will not weary of life;" so that he may love it, so that he may have a life really worth living. There is a love of life which can only lead to the loss of the true life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-25.htm">John 12:25</a>). St. Peter is teaching us to love life wisely, not with that selfish love which Christ condemns. <span class="cmt_word">And see good days</span>. Not necessarily in outward prosperity, but in the favor of God; days of suffering may be good days in the truest souse. <span class="cmt_word">Let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile.</span> We have here the usual parallelism of Hebrew poetry. The word "refrain" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, literally, "let him make it cease") implies a natural tendency to sins against charity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:8-13 Though Christians cannot always be exactly of the same mind, yet they should have compassion one of another, and love as brethren. If any man desires to live comfortably on earth, or to possess eternal life in heaven, he must bridle his tongue from wicked, abusive, or deceitful words. He must forsake and keep far from evil actions, do all the good he can, and seek peace with all men. For God, all-wise and every where present, watches over the righteous, and takes care of them. None could or should harm those who copied the example of Christ, who is perfect goodness, and did good to others as his followers.</body></html>
