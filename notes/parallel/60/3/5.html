It had been accepted by Him in the holy women of old who hoped in Him, and would be accepted again. "The Apostle enforces his doctrine by example," says Leighton: "the most compendious way of teaching." By "holy women" he means, not only holy in character, but "sainted"--consecrated by their memories being recorded for our reverence in Holy Writ.<p><span class= "bld">Who trusted in God.</span>--It is a great pity that "trusted" should have been substituted for the original "hoped." The position of Sara and the holy women of the Old Testament was one of <span class= "ital">expectancy, </span>of looking <span class= "ital">forward</span> to the fulfilment of a promise; and the description of them as such is intended to make the readers of the letter feel the difference of <span class= "ital">their</span> position. To <span class= "ital">them</span> the promise to Sara was accomplished. The expression contains a reference to the mention of God in the last verse.<p><span class= "bld">Adorned themselves, being in subjection.</span>--The imperfect tense of the verb means "<span class= "ital">used</span> to adorn themselves." They took daily pains thus to adorn themselves, and spent, perhaps, as long in the process as the other ladies over their toilette. The participle which is added explains more fully the "after this manner." Their subjection was their ornament.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God;</span> rather, <span class="accented">who hoped in God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>); whose hope was set toward God and rested in God. Bengel says," Vera sanctitas, spes in Deum." St. Peter is the apostle of hope. <span class="cmt_word">Adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands.</span> The apostle bids Christian women to consider the example of the saintly women of the Old Testament. With their hope resting upon God, they could not care for finery and costly jewels. They adorned themselves with the more costly ornament of a meek and quiet spirit: they showed their meekness by living in subjection to their husbands. Submission to authority is the key-note of this part of the Epistle. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 The wife must discharge her duty to her own husband, though he obey not the word. We daily see how narrowly evil men watch the ways and lives of professors of religion. Putting on of apparel is not forbidden, but vanity and costliness in ornament. Religious people should take care that all their behaviour answers to their profession. But how few know the right measure and bounds of those two necessaries of life, food and raiment! Unless poverty is our carver, and cuts us short, there is scarcely any one who does not desire something beyond what is good for us. Far more are beholden to the lowliness of their state, than the lowliness of their mind; and many will not be so bounded, but lavish their time and money upon trifles. The apostle directs Christian females to put on something not corruptible, that beautifies the soul, even the graces of God's Holy Spirit. A true Christian's chief care lies in right ordering his own spirit. This will do more to fix the affections, and excite the esteem of a husband, than studied ornaments or fashionable apparel, attended by a froward and quarrelsome temper. Christians ought to do their duty to one another, from a willing mind, and in obedience to the command of God. Wives should be subject to their husbands, not from dread and amazement, but from desire to do well, and please God. The husband's duty to the wife implies giving due respect unto her, and maintaining her authority, protecting her, and placing trust in her. They are heirs together of all the blessings of this life and that which is to come, and should live peaceably one with another. Prayer sweetens their converse. And it is not enough that they pray with the family, but husband and wife together by themselves, and with their children. Those who are acquainted with prayer, find such unspeakable sweetness in it, that they will not be hindered therein. That you may pray much, live holily; and that you may live holily, be much in prayer.</body></html>
