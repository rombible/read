St. Peter seems rather to have argued from what every one would feel <span class= "ital">must</span> have been the case than from explicit records. Sara's usual subjection is clearly seen in the one instance to which St. Peter refers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-12.htm" title="Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?">Genesis 18:12</a>), where Sara, though not addressing Abraham, but speaking to herself, calls him "my lord." People show their usual habits of mind more freely in speaking to themselves.<p><span class= "bld">Whose daughters ye are.</span>--A very misleading version, following the Vulgate. What St. Peter says is, <span class= "ital">whose children ye became, </span>or <span class= "ital">were made.</span> There was a definite period in their past lives at which they came to be--what they were not before--children of Sara. Have we not here, therefore, a distinct proof that these readers of the Epistle were Gentiles and not Jewesses? Not so. The phrase, "which hoped in God," pointing as it does to the coming of the Messiah, prepares us to understand how these Hebrew women <span class= "ital">became</span> Sara's children. It was only by entering into her hope and attaching themselves to Jesus Christ, for whose coming she had looked. St. Peter has already been insisting on the nothingness of the fleshly descent, the "corruptible seed." As has been pointed out on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-24.htm" title="For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass wither, and the flower thereof falls away:">1Peter 1:24</a>, this doctrine was not first taught by St. Paul, for St. Peter had heard it from the Baptist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-9.htm" title="And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.">Matthew 3:9</a>) and from our Lord Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-39.htm" title="They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.">John 8:39</a>). Whether persons were naturally Jews or Gentiles, they could not be children of Abraham without voluntarily becoming so by embracing his principles--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>by becoming Christians. The participial clauses which follow will need no change of translation, for they express not the act or process by which these ladies <span class= "ital">became</span> children of Sara, but the condition on which they would <span class= "ital">remain</span> her children. A very similar passage occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-14.htm" title="For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end;">Hebrews 3:14</a> : "We have become partakers of the Christ, if (for the future) we hold," &c. (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-8.htm" title="For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord.">1Thessalonians 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm" title="But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.">Hebrews 3:6</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Do well.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1Peter 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-15.htm" title="For so is the will of God, that with well doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:">1Peter 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-20.htm" title="For what glory is it, if, when you be buffeted for your faults, you shall take it patiently? but if, when you do well, and suffer for it, you take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.">1Peter 2:20</a>. The word means, of course, general good behaviour, especially in all wifely duties. As this is a condition of remaining Sara's children, it is implied that it was a characteristic of Sara. Some critics would even put in a parenthesis all the words from "even as" to "ye are," and attach these participles (as they are in the Greek) to the last clause in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-5.htm" title="For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:">1Peter 3:5</a>, thus: "adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands (as Sara, for instance . . . whose daughters ye were made), doing well, and not being afraid," &c. This is, however, somewhat cumbrous, and leaves the clause "whose daughters ye became" a little too bald.<p><span class= "bld">Are not afraid with any amazement.</span>--Though this translation is grammatically possible, it does not make such good sense as to translate, <span class= "ital">are not afraid of any alarm.</span> It is, in fact, a quotation from or allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-25.htm" title="Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes.">Proverbs 3:25</a>, as Bengel points out, where "Be not afraid of sudden fear" is rendered in the LXX. by these same peculiar words. The "Wisdom" in that passage, which brings the calmness with it, is Christ, and it is Christ who must be understood in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-26.htm" title="For the LORD shall be your confidence, and shall keep your foot from being taken.">Proverbs 3:26</a> : "the Lord shall be thy confidence." To be afraid of sudden alarms and panics argues a lack of trust in God's providence and power, and would, therefore, be unbecoming the daughters of Sara, who "hoped in God." The "alarms" which they naturally might fear are, of course, quite general, but especially here, we may suppose, dread of what their unbelieving husbands might do to them. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-13.htm" title="And who is he that will harm you, if you be followers of that which is good?">1Peter 3:13</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord</span>. St. Peter singles out Sarah, as the mother of the chosen people. She obeyed her husband habitually (the imperfect <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> is the reading of some of the oldest manuscripts; the aorist, also well supported, would represent her obedience as a whole, the character of her life now past); she called him lord (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>.) <span class="cmt_word">Whose daughters ye are</span>; literally, w<span class="accented">hose children ye became.</span> This is another indication that the Epistle is addressed, not only to Jewish Christians, but also, and that in large measure, to Gentile converts. Gentile women became by faith the daughters of Sarah; just as we read in St. Paul's Epistles that "they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7</a>); and that Abraham is "the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a>); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-22.htm">Galatians 4:22-31</a>, where St. Paul tells us that we, like Isaac, are the children of promise; children, "not of the bondwoman, but of the free." <span class="cmt_word">As long as ye do well</span>. This clause represents one Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> ("doing good"). Some commentators regard the words from "even as Sara" to "whose daughters ye are" as a parenthesis, and refer the participle to "the holy women" mentioned in ver. 5. This does not seem natural. It is better to regard the second half of this verse as a continuous sentence, and to understand the participle as meaning "if ye do well." The doing well, etc., is a mark that Christian women have become children of Sarah by faith. <span class="cmt_word">And are not afraid with any amazement</span>. The Greek word for "amazement" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) does not occur in any other place of the New Testament, though we meet with the corresponding verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-9.htm">Luke 21:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24.htm">Luke 24</a>:87. There seems to be a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-25.htm">Proverbs 3:25</a>, "Be not afraid of sudden fear ' (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c4;&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is "dismay, scared terrified excitement," very different from the calm thoughtful <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the fear lest they should fail in proper respect for their husbands, and that out of the holy fear of God, which St. Peter inculcates upon wives (ver. 2). The Christian wife might often experience cruel treatment from an unbelieving husband, but she was not to live in a flutter of excited terror; she was to be calm and quiet, trusting in God. As to the construction, the accusative may be cognate, as the Authorized Version takes it; or the accusative of the object, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-25.htm">Proverbs 3:25</a>. The last view is, perhaps, the -most suitable: "And are not afraid of any sudden terror." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 The wife must discharge her duty to her own husband, though he obey not the word. We daily see how narrowly evil men watch the ways and lives of professors of religion. Putting on of apparel is not forbidden, but vanity and costliness in ornament. Religious people should take care that all their behaviour answers to their profession. But how few know the right measure and bounds of those two necessaries of life, food and raiment! Unless poverty is our carver, and cuts us short, there is scarcely any one who does not desire something beyond what is good for us. Far more are beholden to the lowliness of their state, than the lowliness of their mind; and many will not be so bounded, but lavish their time and money upon trifles. The apostle directs Christian females to put on something not corruptible, that beautifies the soul, even the graces of God's Holy Spirit. A true Christian's chief care lies in right ordering his own spirit. This will do more to fix the affections, and excite the esteem of a husband, than studied ornaments or fashionable apparel, attended by a froward and quarrelsome temper. Christians ought to do their duty to one another, from a willing mind, and in obedience to the command of God. Wives should be subject to their husbands, not from dread and amazement, but from desire to do well, and please God. The husband's duty to the wife implies giving due respect unto her, and maintaining her authority, protecting her, and placing trust in her. They are heirs together of all the blessings of this life and that which is to come, and should live peaceably one with another. Prayer sweetens their converse. And it is not enough that they pray with the family, but husband and wife together by themselves, and with their children. Those who are acquainted with prayer, find such unspeakable sweetness in it, that they will not be hindered therein. That you may pray much, live holily; and that you may live holily, be much in prayer.</body></html>
