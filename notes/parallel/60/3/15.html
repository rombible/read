The passage, as it stands in Isaiah, runs literally, "Jehovah Sabaoth, Him shall ye sanctify, and He (shall be) your fear, and He your dread." It becomes, therefore, very striking when we find that, without a shadow of doubt, the right reading here is, <span class= "ital">But sanctify the Lord the Christ in your hearts.</span> How is it possible, except on the supposition that the Catholic doctrine is really a statement of fact, that a Jew like St. Peter should ever have come to apply to a Man whom he had known familiarly, a Man who had served him at table and had washed his feet, the words which Isaiah had said about the "Lord of Hosts?" This passage immediately precedes that which was quoted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-8.htm" title="And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.">1Peter 2:8</a>, and (like that) is not caught up at random, but as coming in the great Immanuel passage. That presence of God which was the palladium of Israel in the days of Hezekiah has found fulfilment in "the Christ" now given. But what is meant by "sanctifying" Him? The phrase is not elsewhere used in the New Testament, except in the Lord's Prayer; but in the Old Testament see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-3.htm" title="Then Moses said to Aaron, This is it that the LORD spoke, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come near me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.">Leviticus 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-23.htm" title="But when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in the middle of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.">Isaiah 29:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-23.htm" title="Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 38:23</a>. As to "glorify" God means (in word and deed) to recognise His glorious perfections; as to "magnify" Him means to recognise His greatness; as to "justify" Him means to recognise His inherent justice; so to "sanctify" Him means to recognise, in word and deed, His full holiness, and therefore to treat Him with due awe. This not only substitutes the fear of God for the fear of man (since they mutually exclude each other), but enforces purity of life, thus catching up again "that which is good" and "for righteousness' sake." This, adds St. Peter, is to be done "in your hearts." This does not mean simply "<span class= "ital">with</span> your hearts," or "<span class= "ital">from</span> your hearts" (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>inwardly, or, with all sincerity and devotion), but it signifies the local habitation where the Christ is to be thus recognised. That is to say: St. Peter, like St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm" title="That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,">Ephesians 3:17</a>), acknowledges an indwelling of <span class= "ital">C</span>hrist in the hearts of the faithful; and this indwelling not merely subjective, consisting of their constant recollection of him, but real and objective: there He is, as in a shrine, and they must pay due reverence to His presence. The Apostle does, in fact, in those words "in your hearts," purposely call attention to the difference between Isaiah's use of the name Immanuel and the Christian meaning of it. To Isaiah, God dwelt in the midst of a people in its corporate capacity; St. Peter knew that, through the Incarnation, each individual Christian has God in him, united with him.<p><span class= "bld">And be.</span>--The better reading omits the connecting particle, so that we should put "being" instead of "and be."<p><span class= "bld">Ready always to give an answer.</span>--This is the consequence of sanctifying Christ within by the worship of a pure life, that no moment, no questioner finds us unprepared to speak with freedom of our hope in Him. The word for "answer" here is <span class= "ital">apologia, </span>an apology; not, of course, in the modern sense of an <span class= "ital">excuse, </span>but a defence, the reply of an accused person, like the well-known <span class= "ital">Apologia Socratis, </span>or the great modern <span class= "ital">Apologia pro Vita Sua, </span>or the works from which Tertullian, Athenagoras, St. Justin, and others are called "The Apologists." It does not mean that every person is bound to be able to state intellectually the nature and grounds of the Christian creed, though such a duty may, perhaps, be fairly <span class= "ital">deduced</span> from the text. It does not say that every Christian ought to know why he is a Christian, but that every Christians own life ought to be so free from taint, so conscious of Christ enshrined within, as to cause him no misgiving in defending the faith from the calumnies (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1Peter 2:12</a>) brought against it. The constant readiness, or freedom from encumbrance of sin, is the main point, "which intimates," says Leighton, "it was not always to be <span class= "ital">done</span> to every one, but we, being <span class= "ital">ready</span> to do, are to consider when, and to whom, and how far." Consciousness of impurity of life shuts a man's mouth from defending Christian morality.<p><span class= "bld">That asketh you a reason.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">that demandeth of you an account.</span> It does not mean inquirers about Christian doctrine, but those who call Christians to account for their profession of the Gospel hopes. Though it must not be exclusively so taken, St. Peter evidently means chiefly the being called into the law court to give account. Probably he is thinking of our Lord's charge to himself and his co-apostles, in St. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-11.htm" title="And when they bring you to the synagogues, and to magistrates, and powers, take you no thought how or what thing you shall answer, or what you shall say:">Luke 12:11</a>. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-5.htm" title="These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter you not:">Matthew 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-16.htm" title="Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the middle of wolves: be you therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.">Matthew 10:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-19.htm" title="But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what you shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what you shall speak.">Matthew 10:19</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Of the hope that is in you.</span>--More literally, <span class= "ital">with regard to the hope that is in you: i.e., </span>with regard to the Christianity in which you share. It is, of course, quite a modern application to the text to see in this anything of the individual assurance of salvation. However fairly it may be argued that a Christian ought to know why he, personally, expects to be saved, it is not the thought of St. Peter here. Christianity is here called a hope, rather than a faith, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-20.htm" title="For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.">Acts 28:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm" title=" If you continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which you have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;">Colossians 1:23</a>, because, especially in times of persecution, so much of our creed has a future tinge.<p><span class= "bld">With meekness and fear.</span>--There ought certainly to be added a warning <span class= "ital">But</span> before these words. The readiness of the Christian's defence of himself and the Church from all moral aspersions is not to be marred by any self-exaltation or improper confidence. Archbishop Leighton says, "Not, therefore, blustering and flying out into invectives because he hath the better on it against any man that questions him touching this hope, as some think themselves certainly authorised to use rough speech because they plead for truth. On the contrary, so much the rather study meekness, for the glory and advantage of the truth." The "fear" will be, in large measure, a dread of overstepping the bounds of truth or modesty in speaking of the Christian morals. The Acts of the Martyrs, with all their splendour, too often show how St. Peter's cautious <span class= "ital">But</span> was needed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts.</span> From <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-13.htm">Isaiah 8:13</a>. The reading of the best and oldest manuscripts here is <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "Sanctify the Lord Christ," or, "Sanctify the Christ as Lord." The absence of the article with <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> in favor of the second translation; but the first seems more natural, more in accordance with the original passage in Isaiah, and the common expression, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, is in its favor. Whichever translation is adopted, St. Peter here substitutes the Savior's Name where the prophet wrote, "the Lord of hosts, Jehovah Sabaoth" - a change which would be nothing less than impious if the Lord Jesus Christ were not truly God. "Sanctify him," the apostle says (as the Lord himself teaches us to say, in the first words of the Lord's Prayer); that is, regard him as most holy, awful in sanctity; serve him with reverence and godly fear; so you will not "be afraid of their terror." The holy fear of God will lift you above the fear of man. "Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-13.htm">Isaiah 8:13</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-23.htm">Isaiah 29:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-23.htm">Ezekiel 38:23</a>). St. Peter adds the words, "in your hearts," to teach us that this reverence, this hallowing of the Name of God, must be inward and spiritual, in our inmost being. <span class="cmt_word">And be ready always to give an answer to every man</span>; literally, <span class="accented">ready always for an apology to every man.</span> The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is often used of a formal answer before a magistrate, or of a written defense of the faith; but here the addition, "to every man," shows that St. Peter is thinking of informal answers on any suitable occasion. <span class="cmt_word">That asketh you a reason of the here that is in you</span>; literally, <span class="accented">an account concerning the hope.</span> Hope is the grace on which St. Peter lays most stress; it lives in the hearts of Christians. Christians ought to be able to give an account of their hope when asked, both for the defense of the truth and for the good of the asker. That account may be very simple; it may be the mere recital of personal experience - often the most convincing of arguments; it may be, in the case of instructed Christians, profound and closely reasoned. Some answer every Christian ought to be able to give. <span class="cmt_word">With meekness and fear</span>. The best manuscripts read, "but with meekness and fear." The word "but" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span>) is emphatic; argument always involves danger of weakening the spiritual life through pride or bitterness. We must sometimes "contend earnestly for the faith;" but it must be with gentleness and awe. We should fear lest we injure our own souls by arrogant and angry controversy; we should seek the spiritual good of our opponents; and we should entertain a solemn awe of the presence of God, with a trembling anxiety to think and to say only what is acceptable unto him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:14-22 We sanctify God before others, when our conduct invites and encourages them to glorify and honour him. What was the ground and reason of their hope? We should be able to defend our religion with meekness, in the fear of God. There is no room for any other fears where this great fear is; it disturbs not. The conscience is good, when it does its office well. That person is in a sad condition on whom sin and suffering meet: sin makes suffering extreme, comfortless, and destructive. Surely it is better to suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing, whatever our natural impatience at times may suggest. The example of Christ is an argument for patience under sufferings. In the case of our Lord's suffering, he that knew no sin, suffered instead of those who knew no righteousness. The blessed end and design of our Lord's sufferings were, to reconcile us to God, and to bring us to eternal glory. He was put to death in respect of his human nature, but was quickened and raised by the power of the Holy Spirit. If Christ could not be freed from sufferings, why should Christians think to be so? God takes exact notice of the means and advantages people in all ages have had. As to the old world, Christ sent his Spirit; gave warning by Noah. But though the patience of God waits long, it will cease at last. And the spirits of disobedient sinners, as soon as they are out of their bodies, are committed to the prison of hell, where those that despised Noah's warning now are, and from whence there is no redemption. Noah's salvation in the ark upon the water, which carried him above the floods, set forth the salvation of all true believers. That temporal salvation by the ark was a type of the eternal salvation of believers by baptism of the Holy Spirit. To prevent mistakes, the apostle declares what he means by saving baptism; not the outward ceremony of washing with water, which, in itself, does no more than put away the filth of the flesh, but that baptism, of which the baptismal water formed the sign. Not the outward ordinance, but when a man, by the regeneration of the Spirit, was enabled to repent and profess faith, and purpose a new life, uprightly, and as in the presence of God. Let us beware that we rest not upon outward forms. Let us learn to look on the ordinances of God spiritually, and to inquire after the spiritual effect and working of them on our consciences. We would willingly have all religion reduced to outward things. But many who were baptized, and constantly attended the ordinances, have remained without Christ, died in their sins, and are now past recovery. Rest not then till thou art cleansed by the Spirit of Christ and the blood of Christ. His resurrection from the dead is that whereby we are assured of purifying and peace.</body></html>
