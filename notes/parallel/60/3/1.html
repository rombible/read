Here, again, the form in the original is participial, joining this injunction on to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-13.htm" title="Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;">1Peter 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-18.htm" title="Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the fraudulent.">1Peter 2:18</a>, where the word is the same in Greek, "wives, in the same way submitting yourselves." Whether this imposes for all time upon Christian wives as complete a submission towards their husbands as is here enjoined might perhaps be questioned, because the special reason for the command in this place was to allay suspicions engendered by the boldness with which Christianity proclaimed the freedom of the individual. St. Peter has just been giving injunctions for absolute submission, even to injustice, on the part of slaves; and the progress of Christianity has abolished slavery altogether. The measure of the Christian wife's submission may safely be left to her own enlightened conscience, guided by other passages of the New Testament not written, like this, for a special emergency.<p><span class= "bld">Your own husbands.</span>--This does not order submission to the husband in contrast to submission to other directors, but rather gives a <span class= "ital">reason</span> for obedience. "The Christian wife that hath love to God," says Leighton, "though her husband be not so comely, or so wise, or any way so amiable, as many others, yet because he is her <span class= "ital">own husband, </span>and because of the Lord's command in the general, and His providence in the particular disposal of His own, therefore she loves and obeys."<p><span class= "bld">That if any obey not the word.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">in order that even supposing some </span>(<span class= "ital">at present</span>)<span class= "ital"> disobey the word. "</span>The word" is, of course, the Gospel, the declaration of the fulfilment of the prophecies in Jesus. And those who "disobey the word" are, according to constant usage, the Jews. The present verb is used of the Jews in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-2.htm" title="But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brothers.">Acts 14:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-5.htm" title="But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took to them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.">Acts 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-9.htm" title="But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.">Acts 19:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-21.htm" title="But to Israel he said, All day long I have stretched forth my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people.">Romans 10:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-31.htm" title="Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.">Romans 11:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-31.htm" title="That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;">Romans 15:31</a>, besides St. Peter's own use in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-8.htm" title="And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.">1Peter 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-17.htm" title="For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?">1Peter 4:17</a>. The only places where it is distinctly used of others are <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-8.htm" title="But to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,">Romans 2:8</a> (of Jew and Gentile together), <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-30.htm" title="For as you in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:">Romans 11:30</a> (where the Gentiles are compared with the Jews), <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-18.htm" title="And to whom swore he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?">Hebrews 3:18</a> (of the Israelites in the wilderness), <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-31.htm" title="By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.">Hebrews 11:31</a> (of the men of Jericho), <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-20.htm" title="Which sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.">1Peter 3:20</a> (of the refractory antediluvians). In any case it must mean a wilful refusal to submit to the Word, in spite of being intellectually convinced. (See especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-8.htm" title="And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.">1Peter 2:8</a>.) For every reason, therefore, it is more probable that the case here supposed is that of Hebrew (Christian) women, married to men of their own race who reject the gospel.<p><span class= "bld">They also may . . .</span>--The order here is not so neat as in the original, and it spoils the point to insert the definite article before "word." It should run, <span class= "ital">In order that</span> . . . <span class= "ital">through their wives' conversation, without a word, they may</span> (literally, <span class= "ital">shall</span>)<span class= "ital"> be gained.</span> There is something almost playful in the substitution of "their wives" instead of "you," and in the "without a word" contrasted with "the word" before. St. Peter seems to enjoy laying the little innocent plot. He was himself, as the Prayer Book reminds us, a married man. And what he means here, is not that those who have resisted the public preaching in the synagogues, should even without that public preaching be won; rather, that though the gospel as uttered verbally only provokes them to opposition, the gospel as submissively <span class= "ital">acted</span> by their wives, without a word said on the matter, ought to convert them. "This model of submission and humility," says M. Renan, meaning the Lamb of God, "is made by Peter the law for all classes of Christian society. The wife above all, without setting up for a preacher (<span class= "ital">sans faire la precheuse</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>ought, by the discreet charm of her piety, to be the great missionary of the faith." The word rendered "won" keeps up the playfulness of that which goes before; it means "to turn a profit," and there is just enough of <span class= "ital">ruse</span> in it to make the enforcement of submission to a husband of opposed religious views seem an enticing little speculation. The tense of the original verb indicates that the scheme is certain to succeed. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-15.htm" title="Moreover if your brother shall trespass against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone: if he shall hear you, you have gained your brother.">Matthew 18:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/9-19.htm" title="For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant to all, that I might gain the more.">1Corinthians 9:19-20</a>.) Archbishop Leighton points out that in Hebrew the name of the book of "Ecclesiastes; or, the Preacher," is a feminine, and the same is the case in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-11.htm" title="The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it.">Psalm 68:11</a>, and elsewhere.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Likewise, ye wives.</span> St. Peter has spoken of the duties of servants: why does he omit those of masters? There must have been Christian masters in Asia Minor, as is plain from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-1.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>. But we notice that St. Paul, though he has a few words for masters, addresses slaves at much greater length. Probably Christian masters were comparatively few, while large numbers of slaves had embraced the religion which could do so much to comfort and elevate the oppressed. Again, the immediate purpose of the apostle is to inculcate submission to authority; therefore, having enforced upon Christian servants the example of their Lord, he proceeds to speak of the duty of Christian wives. Christianity was in its infancy; it was to be the means of abolishing slavery, and of raising woman to her proper place in society; but as yet slaves were cruelly oppressed, and women were ill treated and despised. Aristotle tells us that among the barbarians (and a large proportion of the population in the greater part of Asia Minor was barbarian, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> non-Greek) the woman and the slave hold the same rank ('Pol.,' I. 2:4). In Greek communities the case was different; but even among the Greeks women occupied a very subordinate position. Christianity would introduce a great and sweeping change in the relations of the sexes, as well as in the relations of master and slave. But the change must be gradual, not violent; it must be brought about by the softening and purifying influences of religion, not by revolt against recognized customs and established authority. Indeed, Christianity would introduce an element of division - the Lord had said so (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-51.htm">Luke 12:51-53</a>); families would be divided. It could not be otherwise; Christians must not set even family ties above the love of Christ. But Christian wives must be peacemakers; they must, as far as possible, live at peace even with unbelieving husbands. They would often have much ill treatment to endure in those coarse, cruel days; they must bear it with the quiet strength of gentleness. <span class="cmt_word">Be in subjection to your own husbands</span>; literally, <span class="accented">submitting yourselves.</span> The participle, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a>, seems to look back to the imperative, "submit yourselves," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13</a>. The present participle implies that this voluntary submission is to be habitual. The adjective "your own" (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) emphasizes the duty. <span class="cmt_word">That, if any obey not the Word, they also may without the Word be won by the conversation of the wives</span>. There is a well-supported reading, "Even if any." Husband and wife would often be converted together; but if this should not be the case, and if the unbelieving husband should set himself in direct opposition to the Word of God (for the words "believe not" have more than a negative meaning, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-7.htm">1 Peter 2:7</a>), still Christian wives must submit themselves. They must do this for the glory of God, and with the hope of saving their husbands' souls; that those unbelieving husbands may be won to Christ and to everlasting life by the silent eloquence of the quiet self-restraint and holy behavior of their wives, without argument or preaching on the wives' part. A self-denying holy life will do more to win those with whom we live in close intercourse than even holy words, and much more than debate and controversy. This seems to be the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> rather than the other possible interpretation, "without the preaching of the Word." <span class="accented">Be won</span>; literally, <span class="accented">be gained.</span> Each soul converted is a gain to Christ, to the kingdom of heaven, to itself, in this case also to the wife who is the happy instrument of saving her husband (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-19.htm">1 Corinthians 9:19, 20</a>). The word rendered "conversation" here, as elsewhere, means "conduct, behavior." (Compare, on the whole subject, the teaching of St. Paul, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-18.htm">Colossians 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-9.htm">1 Timothy 2:9-11</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 The wife must discharge her duty to her own husband, though he obey not the word. We daily see how narrowly evil men watch the ways and lives of professors of religion. Putting on of apparel is not forbidden, but vanity and costliness in ornament. Religious people should take care that all their behaviour answers to their profession. But how few know the right measure and bounds of those two necessaries of life, food and raiment! Unless poverty is our carver, and cuts us short, there is scarcely any one who does not desire something beyond what is good for us. Far more are beholden to the lowliness of their state, than the lowliness of their mind; and many will not be so bounded, but lavish their time and money upon trifles. The apostle directs Christian females to put on something not corruptible, that beautifies the soul, even the graces of God's Holy Spirit. A true Christian's chief care lies in right ordering his own spirit. This will do more to fix the affections, and excite the esteem of a husband, than studied ornaments or fashionable apparel, attended by a froward and quarrelsome temper. Christians ought to do their duty to one another, from a willing mind, and in obedience to the command of God. Wives should be subject to their husbands, not from dread and amazement, but from desire to do well, and please God. The husband's duty to the wife implies giving due respect unto her, and maintaining her authority, protecting her, and placing trust in her. They are heirs together of all the blessings of this life and that which is to come, and should live peaceably one with another. Prayer sweetens their converse. And it is not enough that they pray with the family, but husband and wife together by themselves, and with their children. Those who are acquainted with prayer, find such unspeakable sweetness in it, that they will not be hindered therein. That you may pray much, live holily; and that you may live holily, be much in prayer.</body></html>
