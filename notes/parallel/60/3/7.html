We are hardly to take this as a separate paragraph from the foregoing, but rather as a corollary added to it, to correct a false impression that might otherwise have been conveyed.<p><span class= "bld">Dwell.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">dwelling.</span> The participle is attached to the previous sentences, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-16.htm" title="As free, and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.">1Peter 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-18.htm" title="Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the fraudulent.">1Peter 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-1.htm" title="Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;">1Peter 3:1</a>; but St. Peter does not like to say to the husbands "submitting yourselves" (though it is implied in the "likewise"), and conveys the deference which the husbands are to pay under other terms: such as "according to knowledge," "giving honour."<p><span class= "bld">With them.</span>--The whole order of the sentences needs re-arrangement as follows: <span class= "ital">Ye husbands, likewise, dwelling according to knowledge, as with a weaker vessel, with what is female, apportioning honour as to joint heirs also of a grace of life.</span> In order to understand this very hard passage, we must remember what is St. Peter's object all throughout these instructions, viz., to commend Christianity to jealous watchers without. Here, therefore, we may well suppose that he is thinking chiefly of the case of believing husbands (Jewish) married to unbelieving wives (Jewish also), thus presenting the counter-picture to that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-1.htm" title="Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;">1Peter 3:1</a>. And the first thing is that they are to "dwell with" these wives, not to divorce them, nor to cease from conjugal cohabitation with them; such harshness would lend very little attractiveness to the Christian religion among the Jewish homes to which the divorced wife would turn. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.">1Corinthians 7:12</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>--a passage which must almost have been in St. Peter's mind.)<p><span class= "bld">According to knowledge.</span>--This phrase, which is like an adverb, such as "scientifically, intelligently," means that the husband is to study to enter into the whole bearings of the case, to take everything into account. Husband and wife will not get on together smoothly at haphazard, without pains taken to <span class= "ital">understand</span> the situation. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm" title="That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor;">1Thessalonians 4:4</a>; "you should <span class= "ital">know.</span>")<p><span class= "bld">Unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel.</span>--Or rather, as we now take it, <span class= "ital">as with a weaker vessel, with what is female.</span> This explains the saying "according to knowledge." The thing which the husband is specially to understand and take into account is that he is dealing with a thing less strong than himself. The whole of chivalry is in these words, and St. Peter (next after Christ) may be considered the founder of it. Weakness itself, by being weakness, has a claim upon the strong man's deference and self-submission. The weakness here ascribed to the female sex is primarily that of the body, as we shall see when we consider the word "vessel," though it may, perhaps, indicate frailty in other respects as well. If the word "vessel" is to be here a description of a "wife," as some contend on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm" title="That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor;">1Thessalonians 4:4</a>, in a sense in which it does not equally describe a husband, it is difficult to see with what the vessel is compared and pronounced weaker. "Dwell with the female as with a more delicate vessel or instrument" than what? If we answer "than yourselves," it becomes clear that the husbands are, by implication, <span class= "ital">less</span> delicate <span class= "ital">vessels.</span> And this is the case. In the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm" title="That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor;">1Thessalonians 4:4</a>, it has been shown that the word "vessel" (whether as receptacle or as instrument) is a description of the <span class= "ital">body, </span>or rather of the self as manifested in the body. The word in itself may be used to describe anything made to be serviceable--machinery, tackle and gear, pots and pans, and, in fact, any kind of apparatus or implement--and here it might be very fairly rendered, "as with a weaker thing or object." That which is translated "the wife" is really a neuter adjective, and it is a question whether we are to supply with it the noun "vessel"--"with the female [vessel] as with a vessel which is weaker"--or whether it is to stand absolutely, "the female," as we say "the good," "the evil"--<span class= "ital">i.e., "</span>that which is female." The latter seems, on the whole, simpler and more forcible, as calling closer attention to the fact of weakness being inherent in the sex.<p><span class= "bld">Giving honour.</span>--The word for "giving" implies rendering a portion which is <span class= "ital">due.</span> And what is here called "honour" is not to be understood only of the wife's maintenance (as some say), though such is probably the interpretation of the word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-17.htm" title="Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine.">1Timothy 5:17</a>, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-10.htm" title="If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.">Exodus 21:10</a>; nor is the wife only to be honoured by being consulted in affairs of moment and put in charge of the household. The "honour" to be accorded to wives "as to joint heirs of a grace of life" is the same kind of "honour" as St. Paul, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm" title="That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor;">1Thessalonians 4:4</a>, says must be accorded to oneself. Indeed, from the juxtaposition of three significant words there, we can hardly escape the conclusion that St. Peter was remembering that passage of St. Paul, "that every one of you should <span class= "ital">know</span> how to obtain possession of the <span class= "ital">vessel</span> of himself in sanctification and <span class= "ital">honour."</span> It is that chaste respect for the wife which is meant in the Prayer Book by the phrase, "With my body I thee worship." It means that the husband must not dare to take any <span class= "ital">liberties</span> with his wife. Would the Christian husband be likely to approve his religion to the unbelieving wife if she found that he took a coarse view of the conjugal tie?<p><span class= "bld">And as being heirs together of the grace of life.</span>--There is here a very intricate question of readings, on which it depends whether the "heirs" are to be nominative or dative, the husbands or the wives. The present annotator prefers, on the whole, to follow Tischendorf, and read the dative, "paying respect as to persons who are also joint heirs (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>with you) of a grace of life." Happily, it comes to much the same thing, the only difference being that in the one case deference is paid to the wife on the ground of her possessing a joint dignity with the husband, and in the other case on the ground that the husband does not possess his dignity except conjointly with the wife. That dignity which they conjointly "inherit"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>possess as a gift from God--is called "the grace (or perhaps, a grace) of life." This is generally interpreted to mean, "the gracious gift of everlasting life." Undoubtedly, "life" is often used absolutely in the New Testament to mean eternal life--<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-8.htm" title="Why if your hand or your foot offend you, cut them off, and cast them from you: it is better for you to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.">Matthew 18:8</a>; and it gives a very intelligible sense, that the husband should reverence the wife as being equally with himself an everlasting soul. But this neither gives sufficient force to the <span class= "ital">conjoint</span> nature of the possession, nor does it take into account the possibility of such a case as, in fact, we suppose to be here intended, viz., of a believing husband and unbelieving wife. Although, in a sense, "the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-14.htm" title="For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.">1Corinthians 7:14</a>), yet not in such a sense as for them to be called conjoint possessors of eternal life. It seems best, therefore, to suppose that the "grace (or dower) of life" which husband and wife hold, not only in common, but <span class= "ital">conjointly, </span>is life in the <span class= "ital">natural</span> sense. This "grace," this mysterious and divine gift--not apart from one another, but conjointly--they are privileged by the Creator's primeval benediction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm" title="And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.">Genesis 1:28</a>) to transmit. They have the power (no Archangel has the like) to bring human beings into existence. And in consideration that such is the dignity and the intention of marriage, a man may well be called upon to revere his partner in the great prerogative.<p><span class= "bld">That your prayers be not hindered</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the husbands' prayers, not necessarily their prayers <span class= "ital">with</span> their wives. It is easy to feel how the consciousness of having treated a wife with less awe than is indicated by the foregoing words would clog the man's prayers, whether for himself or for his wife's conversion--the latter being, probably, what St. Peter chiefly meant. Very likely he had in view what St. Paul writes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-5.htm" title="Defraud you not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.">1Corinthians 7:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Likewise, ye husbands</span>. As wives are exhorted to be in subjection to their own husbands, so husbands also must do their duty to their wives. The construction (participial as in ver. 1) seems, like ver. 1, to look back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13</a>. The relation, indeed, is no longer directly one of subjection, and marriage is an ordinance of God; but Christian husbands must submit themselves to the duties arising out of the marriage tie; and marriage involves a civil contract, though to us Christians it is a holy estate instituted of God, and a parable of the mystical union that is betwixt Christ and his Church. St. Peter, we observe, does not consider the case of a Christian husband with an unbelieving wife; probably that would be very uncommon. <span class="cmt_word">Dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel</span>; literally, <span class="accented">living together with the feminine as with the weaker vessel.</span> This connection seems best suited to the balance of the sentence, and also to the sense. The apostle bids the husband, first, to give due consideration to his partner on the ground of her comparative weakness; and, secondly, to give her due honor as being an heir, like himself, of the grace of life. The disparity of the sexes was the cause of the degradation of woman among the heathen; Christianity makes it the ground of tender consideration. Christian love should abound in knowledge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-9.htm">Philippians 1:9</a>); it should throw its softening light upon all the relations of life. Man and woman are alike vessels - vessels made by God for his service (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-6.htm">Jeremiah 18:6</a>, etc.; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4, 5</a>); the woman is the weaker, and must, for that very reason, be treated with gentleness. For "according to knowledge," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-5.htm">2 Peter 1:5</a>. Christians must be thoughtful; they must consider what becomes them in all the relations of life; not act carelessly and at random. <span class="cmt_word">And as being heirs together of the grace of life</span>; rather, <span class="accented">rendering honor as to those who are also fellow-heirs</span>, or, according to another well-supported reading, <span class="accented">rendering honor</span> (<span class="accented">to them</span>) <span class="accented">as being also fellow-heirs</span> (<span class="accented">with them</span>). The sense is not materially affected: husband and wife are joint-heirs of the grace of life, that is, of God's gracious gift of everlasting life. <span class="cmt_word">That your prayers be not hindered</span>; or, according to another reading, <span class="accented">be not cut</span> off. If husband and wife live together without mutual reverence and affection, there can be no sympathy in united prayer; the promise made by Christ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-19.htm">Matthew 18:19</a> cannot be realized. Nor can either pray acceptably if they live at variance; jealousies and bickerings are opposed to the spirit of prayer; they hinder the free flow of prayer, and mar its earnestness and devotion. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 The wife must discharge her duty to her own husband, though he obey not the word. We daily see how narrowly evil men watch the ways and lives of professors of religion. Putting on of apparel is not forbidden, but vanity and costliness in ornament. Religious people should take care that all their behaviour answers to their profession. But how few know the right measure and bounds of those two necessaries of life, food and raiment! Unless poverty is our carver, and cuts us short, there is scarcely any one who does not desire something beyond what is good for us. Far more are beholden to the lowliness of their state, than the lowliness of their mind; and many will not be so bounded, but lavish their time and money upon trifles. The apostle directs Christian females to put on something not corruptible, that beautifies the soul, even the graces of God's Holy Spirit. A true Christian's chief care lies in right ordering his own spirit. This will do more to fix the affections, and excite the esteem of a husband, than studied ornaments or fashionable apparel, attended by a froward and quarrelsome temper. Christians ought to do their duty to one another, from a willing mind, and in obedience to the command of God. Wives should be subject to their husbands, not from dread and amazement, but from desire to do well, and please God. The husband's duty to the wife implies giving due respect unto her, and maintaining her authority, protecting her, and placing trust in her. They are heirs together of all the blessings of this life and that which is to come, and should live peaceably one with another. Prayer sweetens their converse. And it is not enough that they pray with the family, but husband and wife together by themselves, and with their children. Those who are acquainted with prayer, find such unspeakable sweetness in it, that they will not be hindered therein. That you may pray much, live holily; and that you may live holily, be much in prayer.</body></html>
