And the word which means "follower" (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>imitator) is here a false reading for <span class= "ital">zelotes, </span>the name by which St. Peter's lesser namesake among the Apostles was known, probably because of his enthusiastic attachment to the old or to the new Law. The same <span class= "ital">zelotes</span> is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm" title="Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.">Titus 2:14</a> and elsewhere. The translation, "of Him which is good," is perfectly possible, but does not quite so well suit the context. Some writers (Leighton among them) take the verse to mean, or at least to include, that when men see the goodness and loving-kindness of our lives they will not be <span class= "ital">disposed</span> to hurt us. This thought is, however, foreign to the passage. It means that men and devils may try their worst, as they did on Christ, and cannot harm us.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And who is he that will harm you?</span> The apostle, as he began his quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>, without marks of citation, so adds at once his inference from it in the form of a question. The conjunction "and" connects the question with the quotation. If God's eye is over the righteous, and his ear open to their prayers, who shall harm them? St. Peter does not mean - Who will have the heart to harm you? He knew the temper of Jews and heathens; he knew also the Savior's prophecies of coming persecution too well to say that. The words remind us of the Septuagint rendering of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-9.htm">Isaiah 50:9</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>; None can do real harm to the Lord's people; they may persecute them, but he will make all things work together for their good. <span class="cmt_word">If ye be followers of that which is</span> <span class="cmt_word">good;</span> rather, <span class="accented">if ye become zealous of that which is good</span>, with the oldest manuscripts. The Authorized Version adopts the reading <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, followers or imitators, which is not so well supported. The genitive <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> admits the masculine translation, "of him that is good," but it is probably neuter in this place (comp. ver. 11). With the masculine rendering, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>, "and was zealous toward God (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>)." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:8-13 Though Christians cannot always be exactly of the same mind, yet they should have compassion one of another, and love as brethren. If any man desires to live comfortably on earth, or to possess eternal life in heaven, he must bridle his tongue from wicked, abusive, or deceitful words. He must forsake and keep far from evil actions, do all the good he can, and seek peace with all men. For God, all-wise and every where present, watches over the righteous, and takes care of them. None could or should harm those who copied the example of Christ, who is perfect goodness, and did good to others as his followers.</body></html>
