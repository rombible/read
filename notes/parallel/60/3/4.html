What St. Peter says is, "Do not rely, for winning your husbands, upon ornamentation (which is but external), but upon character."<p><span class= "bld">The hidden man of the heart.</span>--Not equivalent to St. Paul's expression, "the <span class= "ital">new</span> man" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm" title="And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.">Ephesians 4:24</a>), but simply <span class= "ital">the inner self, the true self</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the genuine moral character. It is more like St. Paul's phrase, "the inward man," and may, perhaps, have been adapted from, it. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-22.htm" title="For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:">Romans 7:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-16.htm" title="For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.">2Corinthians 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm" title="That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;">Ephesians 3:16</a>.) According to his custom, St. Peter explains by adding the genitive, "of the heart." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-13.htm" title="Why gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;">1Peter 1:13</a>.) At the same time, the choice of that particular word, rather than "soul" or "mind," gives warmth and affection to what might otherwise seem a bare moral or metaphysical conception.<p><span class= "bld">In that which is not corruptible.</span>--The sense is somewhat obscured by our insertion of "even the ornament." Had it been "even <span class= "ital">in</span> the ornament," it would have been clearer, though not right even then. It is literally, <span class= "ital">in the imperishableness of the meek and quiet spirit, </span>contrasting the abiding beauty of character with the "perishable" or "contemptible" nature of the ornaments just spoken of. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm" title="For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;">1Peter 1:18</a>, he spoke of "silver and gold" as "perishable." The same kind of phrase is used by St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-17.htm" title="Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy;">1Timothy 6:17</a>, "trust in the uncertainty of riches"--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, in riches which are but uncertain things. So here, "in the imperishableness of the meek spirit" means <span class= "ital">in the meek spirit, which is not</span> (<span class= "ital">like gold</span>)<span class= "ital"> a perishable thing.</span> Yet the preposition "in" must not be taken as equivalent to "dressed in," "adorned with;" the "meek and quiet spirit" is not a mere <span class= "ital">decoration</span> of the "hidden man." Neither, on the other hand, is it quite "consisting in," as though "hidden man" and "meek spirit" were identical; for "the hidden man of the heart" would be bad in bad men, and good in good: see, for instance, our Lord displaying the hidden man of the Pharisee's heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-28.htm" title="Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.">Matthew 23:28</a>). It is rather the particular <span class= "ital">mode</span> in which St. Peter wishes the inward character to exhibit itself. We might paraphrase the whole thus:--"Let it not be with you a matter of external ornamentation--elaborate processes, and costly, but perishable, decorations--but let it be a matter of the heart, the character, the true self, manifesting itself in a constant tone of unassuming and imperturbable sweetness--an imperishable attraction." The word "spirit" here is used, not in its strict metaphysical sense, but in the sense of a mood or general tenour and complexion of life; as, for instance, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-55.htm" title="But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, You know not what manner of spirit you are of.">Luke 9:55</a> (perhaps), <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-21.htm" title="What will you? shall I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?">1Corinthians 4:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm" title="Brothers, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.">Galatians 6:1</a>, and elsewhere. St. Peter assures us in this passage that moral characteristics gained in this life remain our characteristics in the next.<p><span class= "bld">Which is in the sight of God of great</span> <span class= "bld">price.</span>--The antecedent to "which" has been variously taken. Is it "the meek and quiet <span class= "ital">spirit?"</span> Is it "the <span class= "ital">imperishableness</span> of the meek and quiet spirit?" Or is it "the hidden man of the heart exhibiting itself in such a spirit?" Each has something to be said for it, but the last seems nearest to the truth. The thing which is valuable in the eyes of God is the <span class= "ital">having</span> such an inward character. Thus we might put a stronger stop at the word "spirit;" and this relative clause will be another instance of St. Peter's favourite mode of speech noticed on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm" title="Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.">1Peter 2:24</a>. Such a possession will be not only attractive to the husband for the time, but has a permanent value as being esteemed by God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But let it be the hidden man of the heart</span>. The "hidden" is here equivalent to the "inward man" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-22.htm">Romans 7:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-16.htm">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a>. It is that life which is "hid with Christ in God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-2.htm">Colossians 3:2</a>), the life of Christ ("the Second Man") in the heart, fashioning that heart after the likeness of Christ, forming in it "the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>). This is hidden; it does not display itself like those conspicuous ornaments mentioned in the last verse. <span class="cmt_word">In that which is not corruptible</span>, <span class="cmt_word">even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in the incorruptibility of the meek and quiet spirit.</span> This ornament is incorruptible; not like those corruptible things (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>). The meek spirit does not flash into anger, does not answer again, takes harsh words gently and humbly. The quiet spirit is calm and tranquil; peaceful in itself, it spreads peace around (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-2.htm">1 Timothy 2:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which is in the sight of God of great price</span>. The adjective <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c2;</span> is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a> of the ointment with which Mary anointed our Lord, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-9.htm">1 Timothy 2:9</a> of the "<span class="accented">array"</span> which St. Paul discourages for Christian women. Those adornments are costly in the sight of the world; the meek and quiet spirit is precious in the sight of God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 The wife must discharge her duty to her own husband, though he obey not the word. We daily see how narrowly evil men watch the ways and lives of professors of religion. Putting on of apparel is not forbidden, but vanity and costliness in ornament. Religious people should take care that all their behaviour answers to their profession. But how few know the right measure and bounds of those two necessaries of life, food and raiment! Unless poverty is our carver, and cuts us short, there is scarcely any one who does not desire something beyond what is good for us. Far more are beholden to the lowliness of their state, than the lowliness of their mind; and many will not be so bounded, but lavish their time and money upon trifles. The apostle directs Christian females to put on something not corruptible, that beautifies the soul, even the graces of God's Holy Spirit. A true Christian's chief care lies in right ordering his own spirit. This will do more to fix the affections, and excite the esteem of a husband, than studied ornaments or fashionable apparel, attended by a froward and quarrelsome temper. Christians ought to do their duty to one another, from a willing mind, and in obedience to the command of God. Wives should be subject to their husbands, not from dread and amazement, but from desire to do well, and please God. The husband's duty to the wife implies giving due respect unto her, and maintaining her authority, protecting her, and placing trust in her. They are heirs together of all the blessings of this life and that which is to come, and should live peaceably one with another. Prayer sweetens their converse. And it is not enough that they pray with the family, but husband and wife together by themselves, and with their children. Those who are acquainted with prayer, find such unspeakable sweetness in it, that they will not be hindered therein. That you may pray much, live holily; and that you may live holily, be much in prayer.</body></html>
