St. Peter has not, however, forgotten the <span class= "ital">purpose</span> with which the former rules were given; his thought is still how to produce a right impression on the unbelieving world, although some of these injunctions touch only <span class= "ital">internal</span> relations between members of the Church. "By this shall <span class= "ital">all men</span>" says our Lord, "know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love <span class= "ital">one to another"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-35.htm" title="By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one to another.">John 13:35</a>); and, again, "That <span class= "ital">they</span> all may be <span class= "ital">one</span> . . . that the <span class= "ital">world</span> may believe that thou hast sent me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-21.htm" title="That they all may be one; as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that you have sent me.">John 17:21</a>). Accordingly, this verse, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-1.htm" title="Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;">1Peter 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-7.htm" title="Likewise, you husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.">1Peter 3:7</a>, is attached to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-13.htm" title="Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;">1Peter 2:13</a>, and should be translated, <span class= "ital">Finally, being all.</span><p><span class= "bld">Of one mind.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">unanimous.</span> Though the Greek word does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament, the duty is enjoined often, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-16.htm" title="Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.">Romans 12:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-11.htm" title="Finally, brothers, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.">2Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-2.htm" title="Fulfill you my joy, that you be like minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.">Philippians 2:2</a>. It involves an agreement not only in doctrine but in practical aims, the affections of all being in the same direction. This unanimity requires <span class= "ital">expression</span> to be conscious, and therefore it strikes at the root of the reserve by which Christian people do not open out their hearts to each other in the matter of religion. Such unity of mind is no product of indifference, which Leighton describes as "not a knitting together, but a freezing together, as cold congregates all bodies how heterogeneous soever, sticks, stones, and water."<p><span class= "bld">Having compassion one of another.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">sympathetic.</span> The word "compassion" has lost the meaning which it once had, and signifies little more than pity. Here the command includes the "rejoicing with them that do rejoice," as much as the "weeping with them that weep" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-15.htm" title="Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.">Romans 12:15</a>). The same word only occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-15.htm" title="For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.">Hebrews 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-34.htm" title="For you had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that you have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.">Hebrews 10:34</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Love as brethren.</span>--Again a single adjective, <span class= "ital">fraternal, </span>or, loving the brethren. For the meaning see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-22.htm" title="Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:">1Peter 1:22</a>, Notes.<p><span class= "bld">Be pitiful.</span>--Rather (omitting the word "be"), <span class= "ital">tender-hearted.</span> So it is translated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-32.htm" title="And be you kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you.">Ephesians 4:32</a>, the only other place where it occurs. It differs from "sympathetic "in being limited to yearnings over the afflicted. Strangely enough, in profane Greek, the word is only found to mean "strong-hearted."<p><span class= "bld">Be courteous.</span>--The injunction is so charming, and so appropriate in the mouth of St. Peter, that one is almost loth to correct the reading, and substitute (undoubtedly the right word) <span class= "ital">humble-minded.</span> This adjective brings us back to that mutual <span class= "ital">subjection</span> and complaisance which is the main subject of all these rules. Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-5.htm" title="Likewise, you younger, submit yourselves to the elder. Yes, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble.">1Peter 5:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Finally</span>. St. Peter is bringing to a close the exhortations to submission, which depend on the imperative in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13</a>. He turns from particular classes and relations to the whole Christian community, and describes what they ought to be in five Greek words, the first three of which are found nowhere else in the Greek Scriptures. <span class="cmt_word">Be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another;</span> literally, <span class="accented">sympathizing</span>; feeling with others, rejoicing with them that do rejoice, and weeping with them that weep. Love as brethren. An adjective (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;</span>) in the Greek; the corresponding substantive occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-22.htm">1 Peter 1:22</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Be pitiful</span>. This word (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) has undergone a remarkable change of meaning. In Hippocrates, quoted by Huther, it is used literally of one whose viscera are healthy; it is also sometimes used figuratively, as equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; "goodhearted" with the heathen would mean "brave;" with Christian writers "tender," "pitiful." Be courteous. This represents a reading (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) which has very little support. The true reading is <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, humble-minded. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:8-13 Though Christians cannot always be exactly of the same mind, yet they should have compassion one of another, and love as brethren. If any man desires to live comfortably on earth, or to possess eternal life in heaven, he must bridle his tongue from wicked, abusive, or deceitful words. He must forsake and keep far from evil actions, do all the good he can, and seek peace with all men. For God, all-wise and every where present, watches over the righteous, and takes care of them. None could or should harm those who copied the example of Christ, who is perfect goodness, and did good to others as his followers.</body></html>
