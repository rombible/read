But we have seen before that St. Peter deals very freely with participles in the nominative case. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1Peter 2:12</a>, where "having" is nominative, though in strictness it should be accusative, agreeing with "you, as strangers and pilgrims;" comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-18.htm" title="Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the fraudulent.">1Peter 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-1.htm" title="Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;">1Peter 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-7.htm" title="Likewise, you husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.">1Peter 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-9.htm" title="Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that you are thereunto called, that you should inherit a blessing.">1Peter 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/3-15.htm" title="But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:">1Peter 3:15-16</a>.) Like instances are not wanting in classical Greek.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherein they think it strange.</span> <span class="accented">Wherein</span>, in which course of life, in the fact that the Christians once lived like the Gentiles, but now are so wholly changed. The word <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means commonly to be a guest, to live as a stranger in another's house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-6.htm">Acts 10:6, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-16.htm">Acts 21:16</a>); here it means to be astonished, as at some strange sight, as such guests would no doubt sometimes be (comp. ver. 12 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-20.htm">Acts 17:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That ye run not with them to the same excess of riot.</span> The Greek words are very strong, "while ye run not with them," as if the Gentiles were running greedily in troops to riot and ruin. The word for "excess" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) is found here only in the New Testament; it means" an overflowing;" the <span class="accented">rendering sentina</span> ("a sewer" or "cesspool") is doubtful. The word rendered "riot" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-6.htm">Titus 1:6</a>, and is used in the adverbial form in describing the recklessness of the prodigal son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-13.htm">Luke 15:13</a>). It means that lost state in which a man is given up to self-indulgence, and saves neither reputation, earthly position, nor his immortal soul. <span class="cmt_word">Speaking evil of you</span>; better, perhaps, translated literally, <span class="accented">blaspheming.</span> The words "of you" are not in the original; they who revile Christians for well-doing are blasphemers, they speak really against God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-6 The strongest and best arguments against sin, are taken from the sufferings of Christ. He died to destroy sin; and though he cheerfully submitted to the worst sufferings, yet he never gave way to the least sin. Temptations could not prevail, were it not for man's own corruption; but true Christians make the will of God, not their own lust or desires, the rule of their lives and actions. And true conversion makes a marvellous change in the heart and life. It alters the mind, judgment, affections, and conversation. When a man is truly converted, it is very grievous to him to think how the time past of his life has been spent. One sin draws on another. Six sins are here mentioned which have dependence one upon another. It is a Christian's duty, not only to keep from gross wickedness, but also from things that lead to sin, or appear evil. The gospel had been preached to those since dead, who by the proud and carnal judgment of wicked men were condemned as evil-doers, some even suffering death. But being quickened to Divine life by the Holy Spirit, they lived to God as his devoted servants. Let not believers care, though the world scorns and reproaches them.</body></html>
