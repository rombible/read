It means, literally, to feel like people in a strange country, lost and bewildered. It is. further explained by the clause "as though some strange thing were (by bad luck) happening unto you."

Literally it runs, <span class= "ital">Be not bewildered at the conflagration among you taking place for a trial to you.</span> Already, then, the Asiatic Christians are enduring a fierce persecution. The word which describes it is only found besides in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-9.htm" title="And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall mourn her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,">Revelation 18:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-18.htm" title="And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like to this great city!">Revelation 18:18</a>, "burning."

The address, "beloved," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>, shows the depth of his sympathy with them. He resumes the thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>; the persecution is a burning, a fiery furnace, which is being kindled among them for a trial, to try the strength of their faith. The present participles imply that the persecution was already beginning; the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, a burning (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-9.htm">Revelation 18:9, 18</a>), shows the severity. St. Peter tells them its meaning: it was to prove them; it would turn to their good. Persecution was not to be regarded as a strange thing. The Lord had foretold its coming. St. Paul, in his first visit to Asia Minor, had warned them that "<span class="accented">we</span> must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God." (On the word <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, see note on ver. 4.) The thing was not strange; they were not to count it as strange; they must learn, so to speak, to acclimatize themselves to it; it would brace their energies and strengthen their faith. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:12-19 By patience and fortitude in suffering, by dependence on the promises of God, and keeping to the word the Holy Spirit hath revealed, the Holy Spirit is glorified; but by the contempt and reproaches cast upon believers, he is evil spoken of, and is blasphemed. One would think such cautions as these were needless to Christians. But their enemies falsely charged them with foul crimes. And even the best of men need to be warned against the worst of sins. There is no comfort in sufferings, when we bring them upon ourselves by our own sin and folly. A time of universal calamity was at hand, as foretold by our Saviour, Mt 24:9,10. And if such things befall in this life, how awful will the day of judgment be! It is true that the righteous are scarcely saved; even those who endeavour to walk uprightly in the ways of God. This does not mean that the purpose and performance of God are uncertain, but only the great difficulties and hard encounters in the way; that they go through so many temptations and tribulations, so many fightings without and fears within. Yet all outward difficulties would be as nothing, were it not for lusts and corruptions within. These are the worst clogs and troubles. And if the way of the righteous be so hard, then how hard shall be the end of the ungodly sinner, who walks in sin with delight, and thinks the righteous is a fool for all his pains! The only way to keep the soul well, is, to commit it to God by prayer, and patient perseverance in well-doing. He will overrule all to the final advantage of the believer.</body></html>
