Probably, if St. Peter had thought the world would stand twenty centuries more, he would have expressed himself differently; yet see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/3-4.htm" title="And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.">2Peter 3:4-10</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.</span>--These words sum up the cautions given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/4-1.htm" title="For as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;">1Peter 4:1-6</a>, before passing on to the next subject. The first verb includes more than sobriety, and means the keeping a check upon all the desires. The usual notion of sobriety is more exactly conveyed in the word rendered "watch," which is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-13.htm" title="Why gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;">1Peter 1:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm" title="Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour:">1Peter 5:8</a>. "Unto prayer" is a slip for <span class= "ital">unto prayers</span>; the difference is that it does not mean that we are to be always in frame to pray, but that actual prayers should be always on our lips: every incident in life should suggest them. They would be especially necessary if any moment might see the end of the world. The tense of the imperatives in the Greek carries out the notion that the persons addressed had slipped into a careless state, from which they needed an arousal.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the end of all things is at hand.</span> The mention of the judgment turns St. Peter's thoughts into another channel. The end is at hand, not only the judgment of persecutors and slanderers, but the end of persecutions and sufferings, the end of our great conflict with sin, the end of our earthly probation: therefore prepare to meet your God. The end is at hand: it hath drawn near. St. Peter probably, like the other apostles, looked for the speedy coming of the Lord. It was not for him, as it is not for us, "to know the times or the seasons" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>). It is enough to know that our own time is short. When St. Peter wrote these words, the end of the holy city, the center of the ancient dispensation, was very near at hand; and behind that awful catastrophe lay the incomparably more tremendous judgment, of which the fall of Jerusalem was a figure. That judgment, we know now, was to be separated by a wide interval from the dale of St. Peter's Epistle. But that interval is measured, in the prophetic outlook, not by months and years. We are now living in "the last times" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm">1 Timothy 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>). The coming of our Lord was the hennaing of the last period in the development of God's dealings with mankind; there is no further dispensation to be looked for. "Not only is there nothing mere between the Christian's present state of salvation and the end, but the former is itself already the end, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the beginning of the end" (Schott, quoted by Huther). <span class="cmt_word">Be ye therefore sober</span>; rather, <span class="accented">self-restrained, calm, thoughtful.</span> The thought of the nearness of the end should not lead to excitement and neglect of common duties, as it did in the case of the Thessalonian Christians, and again at the approach of the thousandth year of our era. <span class="cmt_word">And watch unto prayer;</span> rather, <span class="accented">be sober unto prayers.</span> The word translated "watch" in the Authorized Version is not that which we read in our Lord's exhortation to "watch and pray." The word used here (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) rather points to temperance, abstinence from strong drinks, though it suggests also that wariness and cool thoughtfulness which are destroyed by excess. The Christian must be self-restrained and sober, and that with a view to perseverance in prayer. The aorist imperatives, perhaps, imply that St. Peter's readers needed to be stirred up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-13.htm">2 Peter 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-1.htm">2 Peter 3:1</a>), to be aroused from that indifference into which men are so apt to fall. The exhortation to persevere in watchfulness would be expressed by the present. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:7-11 The destruction of the Jewish church and nation, foretold by our Saviour, was very near. And the speedy approach of death and judgment concerns all, to which these words naturally lead our minds. Our approaching end, is a powerful argument to make us sober in all worldly matters, and earnest in religion. There are so many things amiss in all, that unless love covers, excuses, and forgives in others, the mistakes and faults for which every one needs the forbearance of others, Satan will prevail to stir up divisions and discords. But we are not to suppose that charity will cover or make amends for the sins of those who exercise it, so as to induce God to forgive them. The nature of a Christian's work, which is high work and hard work, the goodness of the Master, and the excellence of the reward, all require that our endeavours should be serious and earnest. And in all the duties and services of life, we should aim at the glory of God as our chief end. He is a miserable, unsettled wretch, who cleaves to himself, and forgets God; is only perplexed about his credit, and gain, and base ends, which are often broken, and which, when he attains, both he and they must shortly perish together. But he who has given up himself and his all to God, may say confidently that the Lord is his portion; and nothing but glory through Christ Jesus, is solid and lasting; that abideth for ever.</body></html>
