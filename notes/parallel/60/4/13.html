The word rendered "inasmuch as" (which occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-12.htm" title="For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man has, and not according to that he has not.">2Corinthians 8:12</a>) seems to mean, "in proportion as:" "the more nearly you are made to share Christ's sufferings the more you should rejoice." In the <span class= "ital">Acts of St. Probus</span> (a Cappadocian), when, after many other tortures, the judge ordered them to heat some nails and run them through his hands, the martyr exclaims, "Glory to Thee, Lord Jesus Christ, who hast even deigned to let my <span class= "ital">hands be pierced</span> for Thy name's sake!"<p><span class= "bld">Christ's sufferings.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the sufferings of the Christ.</span> (Comp.

This is to be attached to "think it not strange, but rejoice"--"in order that at the revelation of His glory also (as now, in the sharing of His sufferings) ye may rejoice (the word is the same), exulting." Such a recognition of the meaning of suffering, such a rejoicing in suffering now, is a sure means to rejoicing in glory also hereafter.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings.</span> St. Peter speaks in stronger language; he repeats the Lord's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a>. Christians should learn to rejoice in persecution; they must rejoice in so far as, in proportion as (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;</span>), they are partakers of Christ's sufferings (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-13.htm">Hebrews 13:13</a>). Suffering meekly borne draws the Christian nearer to Christ, lifts him, as on a cross, nearer to the crucified Lord; but this it does only when he looks to Jesus in his suffering, when the eye of faith is fixed upon the cross of Christ. Then faith unites the sufferings of the disciple with the sufferings of his Lord; he is made a partaker of Christ's sufferings; and so far as suffering has that blessed result, in such measure he must rejoice in his sufferings. That, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy; literally, <span class="accented">that in the revelation of Ms glory also ye may rejoice exulting.</span> The word for "exulting," <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, corresponds with that used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>). Joy in suffering now is the earnest of the great joy of the redeemed at the revelation of that glory which they now see through a glass darkly. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:12-19 By patience and fortitude in suffering, by dependence on the promises of God, and keeping to the word the Holy Spirit hath revealed, the Holy Spirit is glorified; but by the contempt and reproaches cast upon believers, he is evil spoken of, and is blasphemed. One would think such cautions as these were needless to Christians. But their enemies falsely charged them with foul crimes. And even the best of men need to be warned against the worst of sins. There is no comfort in sufferings, when we bring them upon ourselves by our own sin and folly. A time of universal calamity was at hand, as foretold by our Saviour, Mt 24:9,10. And if such things befall in this life, how awful will the day of judgment be! It is true that the righteous are scarcely saved; even those who endeavour to walk uprightly in the ways of God. This does not mean that the purpose and performance of God are uncertain, but only the great difficulties and hard encounters in the way; that they go through so many temptations and tribulations, so many fightings without and fears within. Yet all outward difficulties would be as nothing, were it not for lusts and corruptions within. These are the worst clogs and troubles. And if the way of the righteous be so hard, then how hard shall be the end of the ungodly sinner, who walks in sin with delight, and thinks the righteous is a fool for all his pains! The only way to keep the soul well, is, to commit it to God by prayer, and patient perseverance in well-doing. He will overrule all to the final advantage of the believer.</body></html>
