And unless this be understood, we become involved in the difficulty that whereas, up to this very point, St. Peter has been urging the future martyrs, by the example of Christ, to face the death of the body bravely, he would now be sliding confusedly into treating of the baptismal death to sin, and indeed actually saying that a martyr's death was a step to leading the rest of the life on earth becomingly! But if we attach <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-2.htm" title="That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.">1Peter 4:2</a> to the clause "arm yourselves," it runs, without any confusion, thus: "As Christ suffered to the flesh without shrinking, take for your protection and support the same thought which proved. a protection and support to Him--viz., that to be rid of sin for ever was the greatest of all possible blessings, and that this is only attainable through the bodily death; and the result of embracing this thought will be, that for the rest of your lives on earth (so soon, perhaps, to be cut violently short.) you may no longer live to men's lusts, but to God's will."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh.</span> On the whole, it seems better to connect this clause with the imperative: "Arm yourselves with the same mind, that ye no longer should live the rest of your time;" rather than with the clause immediately preceding: "He that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; that he no longer should live," etc.; though both connections give a good sense. The Greek word for "live" (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) occurs only here in the New Testament. Bengel says, "Aptum verbum, non die fur de brutis.' "In the flesh "<span class="accented">here</span> means simply "in the body," in this mortal life. "<span class="accented">The</span> rest of your time" suggests the solemn thought of the shortness of our earthly pilgrimage: bye for eternity. <span class="cmt_word">To the lusts of men, but to the will of God.</span> The datives are normal; they express the pattern or rule according to which our life ought to be fashioned. God's will is our sanctification (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>). That will is ever the same, a fixed, unchanging rule; the lusts of men are shifting, uncertain, restless. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-6 The strongest and best arguments against sin, are taken from the sufferings of Christ. He died to destroy sin; and though he cheerfully submitted to the worst sufferings, yet he never gave way to the least sin. Temptations could not prevail, were it not for man's own corruption; but true Christians make the will of God, not their own lust or desires, the rule of their lives and actions. And true conversion makes a marvellous change in the heart and life. It alters the mind, judgment, affections, and conversation. When a man is truly converted, it is very grievous to him to think how the time past of his life has been spent. One sin draws on another. Six sins are here mentioned which have dependence one upon another. It is a Christian's duty, not only to keep from gross wickedness, but also from things that lead to sin, or appear evil. The gospel had been preached to those since dead, who by the proud and carnal judgment of wicked men were condemned as evil-doers, some even suffering death. But being quickened to Divine life by the Holy Spirit, they lived to God as his devoted servants. Let not believers care, though the world scorns and reproaches them.</body></html>
