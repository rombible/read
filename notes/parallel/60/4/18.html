The quotation proves to us St. Peter's perfect familiarity with both the Hebrew original and the Greek version. We have seen how he rejects the LXX. version when it does not suit his meaning (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-8.htm" title="And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.">1Peter 2:8</a>): here it suits him (though it differs from the Hebrew), and he accepts it. The "righteous" man here means, apparently, as Leighton says, "he that endeavours to walk uprightly in the ways of God," rather than the man who is then declared finally justified. The fact that they are "scarcely" saved "imports not," according to Leighton, "any uncertainty or hazard in the thing itself to the end, in respect of the purpose and performance of God, but only the great difficulties and hard encounters in the way." This is only partly true. The Apostle is rather thinking of the final judgment than of the life of trial; and he means that there was but little margin left: a very few more falls, a few more refusals to follow the calls of grace, and they would have been lost. Doubtless, when the best of us looks back, in the light of the last day, upon all that he has been through, he will be amazed that he ever could be saved at all. Yet Bengel well calls us to see the other side of the picture in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-11.htm" title="For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.">2Peter 1:11</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The ungodly and the sinner.</span>--This is the Gentile character. "Ungodly" denotes open irreligion--contempt of God and all that belongs to His worship. "Sinner" goes more to the moral side of the nature, pointing most of all to sins of the flesh. (Comp., for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-37.htm" title="And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,">Luke 7:37</a>.) "Sinners" was almost a synonym for "Gentiles." (See, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-32.htm" title="For if you love them which love you, what thank have you? for sinners also love those that love them.">Luke 6:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-7.htm" title="Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.">Luke 24:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-15.htm" title="We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,">Galatians 2:15</a>.) The question "Where shall he appear?" imagines some scene such as that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-32.htm" title="And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats:">Matthew 25:32</a> : "Where shall we see him? where will he have to stand?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And if the righteous scarcely be saved.</span> St. Peter is quoting the Septuagint Version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-31.htm">Proverbs 11:31</a>. That version departs considerably from the Hebrew, which is accurately represented by the Authorized Version, "Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth; much more the wicked and the sinner." Probably the word rendered" recompensed," which is neutral in its meaning, is best understood here, not of the good deeds of the righteous, but of the sin which still cleaves to all human righteousness. The righteous shall be requited in the earth, that is, chastised for his transgressions. So it would be now, St. Peter says; judgment must begin at the house of God. He adopts the inexact Septuagint translation for its substantial truth, as we now sometimes use versions which are sufficient for practical purposes, though we know them to be critically inaccurate. We observe again the absence of marks of quotation, as often in St. Peter. Bengel well remarks that the awful "scarcely" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) is softened by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-11.htm">2 Peter 1:11</a>. Where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear? The" ungodly "are the impious, scoffers, and blasphemers; the" sinners" are men of profligate and dissolute lives. But the words are (probably) included under one article in the Greek; the men were the same; one form of evil led to the other (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-5.htm">Psalm 1:5</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-25.htm">Matthew 19:25</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:12-19 By patience and fortitude in suffering, by dependence on the promises of God, and keeping to the word the Holy Spirit hath revealed, the Holy Spirit is glorified; but by the contempt and reproaches cast upon believers, he is evil spoken of, and is blasphemed. One would think such cautions as these were needless to Christians. But their enemies falsely charged them with foul crimes. And even the best of men need to be warned against the worst of sins. There is no comfort in sufferings, when we bring them upon ourselves by our own sin and folly. A time of universal calamity was at hand, as foretold by our Saviour, Mt 24:9,10. And if such things befall in this life, how awful will the day of judgment be! It is true that the righteous are scarcely saved; even those who endeavour to walk uprightly in the ways of God. This does not mean that the purpose and performance of God are uncertain, but only the great difficulties and hard encounters in the way; that they go through so many temptations and tribulations, so many fightings without and fears within. Yet all outward difficulties would be as nothing, were it not for lusts and corruptions within. These are the worst clogs and troubles. And if the way of the righteous be so hard, then how hard shall be the end of the ungodly sinner, who walks in sin with delight, and thinks the righteous is a fool for all his pains! The only way to keep the soul well, is, to commit it to God by prayer, and patient perseverance in well-doing. He will overrule all to the final advantage of the believer.</body></html>
