The speaking is, of course, public preaching in the Church; and the man who does so is to do it "as oracles of God." The article is not added in the Greek, so that it must not be pressed to mean "speaking on the model, or in accordance with the doctrines of., the Old Testament." Rather, the emphatic word is "of God;" and the Apostle means that the preacher is not to trust to his own natural powers and wit, or to seek applause for himself, but to act as one possessed of powers not his own; to speak only that which God inspires him to speak. This clause must not be taken as being in this place complete in itself. It is apparently only introduced to give point to what follows, the intention of the whole paragraph being to enforce liberality. It is easy to recognise in <span class= "ital">spiritual</span> things the principle of God being all in all; and St. Peter bids them apply the same principle to material gifts. "Recollect that <span class= "ital">whatever</span> you possess, you possess from God in trust for the Church. Just as the man who preaches is to preach as a mere mouthpiece of God, so the man who gives must consider himself as being but God's dispenser, that in this, too, God may have all the glory." For the same kind of rhetorical effect, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-17.htm" title="Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.">1Peter 2:17</a>, last Note.<p><span class= "bld">If any man minister.</span>--This does not mean "ministering" in the congregation, or spiritual ministrations of any sort, but giving the good things of this life for the benefit of the poor. The word rendered "ability" not unfrequently expresses (like our word "resources") a sufficiency of wealth; and the word which appears as "giveth" is the same which is used of supplying material blessings in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-10.htm" title="Now he that ministers seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)">2Corinthians 9:10</a>. In a compound form, the same verb occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-5.htm" title="He therefore that ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?">Galatians 3:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/1-5.htm" title="And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;">2Peter 1:5-11</a>; and the substantive in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm" title="From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.">Ephesians 4:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-19.htm" title="For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,">Philippians 1:19</a>. The original classical meaning of the word is to pay the expenses of putting a play on the stage, which at Athens was a public burden borne by the wealthier citizens in turn, like the shrievalty of an English county. Thus the wealthy Christian who supports the Church and relieves all the poor is not really the Church's patron: he is a responsible manager; but the paymaster is God.<p><span class= "bld">That God in all things may be glorified.</span>--How clearly St. Peter works it out: "the manifold grace of <span class= "ital">God</span>," "as oracles of <span class= "ital">God,"</span> "out of the resources of which <span class= "ital">God</span> is paymaster," "that <span class= "ital">God</span> in all things may be glorified." The "all things" means emphatically that in these money matters as much as in the spiritual works God's honour is concerned. For a most touching expansion of this text, see the Epistle of St. Theonas, Patriarch of Alexandria, to the High Chamberlain of the Emperor Diocletian, an English translation of which may be seen in <span class= "ital">The Persecution of Diocletian, </span>by the same hand as these Notes.<p><span class= "bld">Through Jesus Christ.</span>--They see and feel that, had it not been for Jesus Christ, these rich men would not have been so liberal; and when they thus thank Him for it, they are in effect thanking God.<p><span class= "bld">To whom</span>.--That is, to God, rather than to Jesus Christ. And it should be, "to whom <span class= "ital">is</span>," or <span class= "ital">belongs, </span>rather than "to whom <span class= "ital">be," </span>and <span class= "ital">"the</span> glory and <span class= "ital">the</span> dominion," not "glory and dominion."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If any man speak, let him speak</span> <span class="cmt_word">as the oracles of God.</span> St. Peter proceeds to give examples of the proper use of gifts. One of those gifts is utterance. The apostle means all Christian utterance, whether public in the Church, or private in Christian conversation or ministrations to the sick. The second clause may be also rendered, as in the Revised Version, "speaking as it were oracles of God." It is more natural to supply the participle" speaking" than "let him speak," after the analogy of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> ("ministering") in ver. 10. For the word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, oracles, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-2.htm">Romans 3:2</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>, in which last place the Scriptures of the New Testament seem to be intended. The apostle's meaning may be either that the Christian teacher was to speak as do the oracles of God, that is, the Scriptures, or (and the absence of the article rather favors this view) that he was so to yield himself to the guidance of the Holy Spirit, that his teaching should be the teaching of God; he was to seek no praise or reward for himself, but only the glory of God. Those who with single-hearted zeal seek God's glory do speak as it were oracles of God, for he speaketh by them (camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-11.htm">Mark 13:11</a>). If any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth. Again it is better to supply the participle "ministering." Whatever a man's gifts may be, he must minister them for the good of the whole Church (see ver. 9; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12.htm">Romans 12</a>. S; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And this he must do as of the strength which God supplieth</span>; the strength is not his - God giveth it. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, rendered "giveth," is used in classical Greek first of supplying the expenses of a chorus, then of liberal giving generally; it occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>. The compound, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, is more common; St. Peter has it in the Second Epistle (1. 5, 11). That God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ. The glory of God should be the one end of all Christian work. The Lord himself had said so in the sermon on the mount, in words doubtless well remembered by the apostle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>; camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To whom be praise and dominion forever and ever. Amen</span>; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">whose is the glory and dominion for the ages of ages.</span> It is thought by some that St. Peter is here quoting from some ancient form of prayer; the use of the "Amen," and the resemblance to <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a> and Rev 5:13, seem to favor this supposition. It is uncertain whether this doxology is addressed to God the Father or to the Lord Jesus Christ; the order of the words is in favor of the latter view, and the doxology closely resembles that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:7-11 The destruction of the Jewish church and nation, foretold by our Saviour, was very near. And the speedy approach of death and judgment concerns all, to which these words naturally lead our minds. Our approaching end, is a powerful argument to make us sober in all worldly matters, and earnest in religion. There are so many things amiss in all, that unless love covers, excuses, and forgives in others, the mistakes and faults for which every one needs the forbearance of others, Satan will prevail to stir up divisions and discords. But we are not to suppose that charity will cover or make amends for the sins of those who exercise it, so as to induce God to forgive them. The nature of a Christian's work, which is high work and hard work, the goodness of the Master, and the excellence of the reward, all require that our endeavours should be serious and earnest. And in all the duties and services of life, we should aim at the glory of God as our chief end. He is a miserable, unsettled wretch, who cleaves to himself, and forgets God; is only perplexed about his credit, and gain, and base ends, which are often broken, and which, when he attains, both he and they must shortly perish together. But he who has given up himself and his all to God, may say confidently that the Lord is his portion; and nothing but glory through Christ Jesus, is solid and lasting; that abideth for ever.</body></html>
