(Comp. the same word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-22.htm" title="Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:">1Peter 1:22</a>; also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-44.htm" title="And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.">Luke 22:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-5.htm" title="Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church to God for him.">Acts 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-7.htm" title="To which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.">Acts 26:7</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Shall cover.</span>--Properly, neither "shall" nor "will," the right reading being present, <span class= "ital">covereth.</span> The words are usually said to be a quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-12.htm" title="Hatred stirs up strifes: but love covers all sins.">Proverbs 10:12</a>, "Hatred stirreth up strifes, but love covereth all sins;" but they are widely different from the LXX. in that passage, and also vary from the Hebrew; and as precisely the same variation occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-20.htm" title="Let him know, that he which converts the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.">James 5:20</a>, it seems more probable either that St. Peter had the passage of St. James consciously in his mind, or that the proverb was current and familiar to both writers in the form, "Love covereth a multitude of sins." It is, therefore, unsafe to argue from the exact shade of meaning which the words bear in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-12.htm" title="Hatred stirs up strifes: but love covers all sins.">Proverbs 10:12</a>. To "cover," in Hebrew, often means to "forgive," the idea being that of an offensive object which you bury or hide by putting something else over it; see, for examples, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm" title="Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.">Psalm 32:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-2.htm" title="You have forgiven the iniquity of your people, you have covered all their sin. Selah.">Psalm 85:2</a>; and the place in Proverbs seems to mean that whereas a bitter enemy will rake up every old grudge again and again, one who loves will not allow even himself to see the wrongs done to him by a friend. If this sense be accepted here, it will imply that the Christians in Asia had a good deal to put up with from each other; but even so, the argument seems a little strained: "Keep your charity at its full stretch, <span class= "ital">because</span> charity forgives, however many the wrongs may be." It far better suits the context to take the proverb in the same sense as in St. James, without any reference to the Old Testament passage. In St. James it is usually taken to mean, "He shall save (the convert's) soul from death, and shall cover (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>procure for him the pardon of) a multitude of sins;" but as the true reading there is <span class= "ital">"his</span> soul," it is more natural to suppose that St. James is holding up, as the reward of converting the sinner, that the person who does so shall save his <span class= "ital">own</span> soul, and procure for <span class= "ital">himself</span> the pardon of a multitude of sins. So here it seems obvious that St. Peter is urging charity as something which will be found advantageous when the "end of all things" comes; and the advantage he mentions is, "because charity covereth a multitude of sins:" <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the exercise of this grace makes up for a great many other shortcomings in the man. A very good case might be made out for a doctrine of Justification by Love.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And above all things have fervent</span> <span class="cmt_word">charity among yourselves;</span> more literally, <span class="accented">before all things, having your love towards one another intense.</span> The existence of charity is taken for granted. Christians must love one another; love is the very badge of their profession. The apostle urges his readers to keep that love intense, and that before all things; for charity is the first of Christian graces. (On the word "intense" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>), see note on 1 Peter 1:22.) <span class="cmt_word">For charity shall cover the multitude of sins</span>. Read and translate, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">for love covereth a multitude of sins.</span> If St. Peter is directly quoting <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-12.htm">Proverbs 10:12</a>, he is not using the Septuagint, as he commonly does, but translating from the Hebrew. The Septuagint rendering is quite different, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. But it may be that the words had become proverbial. We find them also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-20.htm">James 5:20</a>, "He which converteth the sinner... shall hide a multitude of sins." St. James means that he will obtain God's forgiveness for the converted sinner; but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-12.htm">Proverbs 10:12</a> the meaning (as is plain from the context) is that love covers the sins of others; does not stir up strifes, as hatred does, but promotes concord by concealing and forgiving sins. This is probably St. Peter's meaning here: "Take care that your charity is intense, for only thus can you forgive as you are bidden to forgive, as you hope to be forgiven." Perhaps he was thinking of the "seventy times seven," to which the Lord had told him that forgiveness was to extend. But his words may well be understood as implying more than this. Love shown in forgiving others will win forgiveness for yourselves: "Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven." Love manifested in converting others will cover their sins, and obtain God's forgiveness for them. In the deepest sense, it is only the love of Christ energizing in his atoning work which can cover sin; but true charity, Christian love, flows from that holiest love. "Love is of God, and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God." Therefore in some sense Christian love, flowing from the love of Christ, and bringing the Christian very near to Christ, covers sins; for it keeps the Christian close to the cross, within the immediate sphere of the blessed influences of the atonement, so that he becomes a center of grace, a light kindled from the true Light, a well of living waters fed by the one fountain which is opened for sin and for uncleanness. The mutual love of Christians, their kindly words and deeds, check the work of sin; their prayers, their intercessions, call down the forgiveness of God. Therefore, in the view of the approaching end, charity is before all things precious for our own souls and for the souls of others. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:7-11 The destruction of the Jewish church and nation, foretold by our Saviour, was very near. And the speedy approach of death and judgment concerns all, to which these words naturally lead our minds. Our approaching end, is a powerful argument to make us sober in all worldly matters, and earnest in religion. There are so many things amiss in all, that unless love covers, excuses, and forgives in others, the mistakes and faults for which every one needs the forbearance of others, Satan will prevail to stir up divisions and discords. But we are not to suppose that charity will cover or make amends for the sins of those who exercise it, so as to induce God to forgive them. The nature of a Christian's work, which is high work and hard work, the goodness of the Master, and the excellence of the reward, all require that our endeavours should be serious and earnest. And in all the duties and services of life, we should aim at the glory of God as our chief end. He is a miserable, unsettled wretch, who cleaves to himself, and forgets God; is only perplexed about his credit, and gain, and base ends, which are often broken, and which, when he attains, both he and they must shortly perish together. But he who has given up himself and his all to God, may say confidently that the Lord is his portion; and nothing but glory through Christ Jesus, is solid and lasting; that abideth for ever.</body></html>
