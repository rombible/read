They are "of our life," and "us." The first is added by some scribe to point the contrast with "the rest of his time." The second--which should be "you," if anything at all--is simply put to fill the gap after the word "suffice." If "our life" and "us" were right, we should have St. Peter, quite unlike his wont, identifying himself with the bad life here described, as though he himself had shared in it.<p><span class= "bld">May suffice.</span>--It is the same word as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-34.htm" title="Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof.">Matthew 6:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-25.htm" title="It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?">Matthew 10:25</a>, and would be, literally, <span class= "ital">For sufficient is the past.</span> There is an irony in the word similar to that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-17.htm" title="For it is better, if the will of God be so, that you suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.">1Peter 3:17</a>, "it is better."<p><span class= "bld">To have wrought.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">to have perpetrated.</span> The Greek word denotes <span class= "ital">the</span> accomplishment of a <span class= "ital">criminal</span> purpose, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-9.htm" title="Tribulation and anguish, on every soul of man that does evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;">Romans 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="For I truly, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed,">1Corinthians 5:3</a>; and one passage more horrid still.<p><span class= "bld">The will of the Gentiles.</span>--Just as, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-2.htm" title="That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.">1Peter 4:2</a>, there was a contrast between man's manifold and conflicting lusts and God's unity of will, so there is a contrast now between God's "will" and (for the Greek word is quite different) the heathen's "wish." "To have perpetrated the heathen's wish" means to have done the bad things which the heathen wanted them to be guilty of. The heathen were fain to catch them at malpractices. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1Peter 2:12</a>, and the word "speaking evil" below.)<p><span class= "bld">When we walked.</span>--A participle in Greek, which gives no support to the use of "we," but means simply <span class= "ital">having proceeded.</span> Thus it does not directly state that they <span class= "ital">had</span> so proceeded, for the participle explains the foregoing verb: "The past is sufficient to have done what the heathen want you to have done--viz., to have walked."<p><span class= "bld">Lasciviousness.</span>--It should be plural, expressing the repeated acts of sin. The word in Greek means any outrageous debauchery, so that it may be said to include all the words that follow.<p><span class= "bld">Excess of wine,</span> in like manner, should be plural. It is a contemptuous word (<span class= "ital">wine-swillings</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and differs from the word translated "banquetings", below, because the latter is more refined, and also implies company, which the first need not. The "revellings" might mean any roystering parties, but contains more of the notion of making a pretext of a <span class= "ital">meal</span> than "banquetings," which consist solely of drinking.<p><span class= "bld">Abominable idolatries.</span>--It is not <span class= "ital">as</span> idolatries that they are called abominable, but because of the abominable adjuncts of the idol-festivals. This clause is the main support of those who think that the Letter was written to converts from heathenism and not from Judaism. How, it is urged, could St. Peter have said to persons who had been brought up as Jews, "The time past is long enough for you to have proceeded in abominable idolatries"? The argument is most convincing as it stands. If they had been living in idolatry, it is incredible that they were of Hebrew race: if they were of Hebrew race, it is incredible that they should have lived in idolatry. But, as a matter of fact, St. Peter does not say that they ever <span class= "ital">had</span> lived in those sins. Quite on the contrary, he says, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-4.htm" title="Wherein they think it strange that you run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:">1Peter 4:4</a>, that the heathen found, to their surprise, that the Christians would <span class= "ital">not</span> go with them in these things; and that, finding it to be so, they "blasphemed" or slandered them in this very respect. It may, perhaps, be answered that the Apostle is alluding to a period <span class= "ital">long</span> past, and contrasting it with the present which so puzzled the Gentiles. But there is no ground for taking "the time past" to mean the time up to the date of their conversion to Christianity. It is simply "your past time" (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the whole up to the date of the Letter), in contrast with "the rest of your time" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-2.htm" title="That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.">1Peter 4:2</a>, literally, <span class= "ital">your remaining time</span>)<span class= "ital">, i.e., </span>the whole subsequent to the date of the Letter; so that it cannot mean, "The heathen think it strange that you do not join their profligate courses as you used in old days," in which case we should naturally have expected him to say, "They think it strange that ye <span class= "ital">no longer</span> run with them." Besides, it seems plain, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-2.htm" title="That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.">1Peter 4:2</a>, that. whatever may be meant by "perpetrating the wish of the Gentiles," it was still a <span class= "ital">present</span> danger when St. Peter wrote, or there would be little point in mentioning it at all. But if he means that, up to the date of the Letter, some of the recipients of it had been living in "abominable idolatries," how could he continue that the Gentiles were astonished that they did <span class= "ital">not</span> do so? for if the idolatries meant were the heathen's own idolatries, the heathen would have been aware of their joining them, and it would have been no "slander" to say so. The conclusion is, that neither before nor after their conversion had they been really proceeding thus. St. Peter is, in fact, only putting in words the slander of the Gentiles, at which he had hinted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1Peter 2:12-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-16.htm" title="Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.">1Peter 3:16</a>. "For the <span class= "ital">future," </span>says he, "live to the will of God, not to the lusts of men. The <span class= "ital">past</span> is long enough (without invading the future) to have perpetrated what the heathen want you to have perpetrated--viz., to have been proceeding in debaucheries and abominable idolatries--slandering you in that very point wherein they are puzzled if you do not run with them to the same excess of riot." As an historical fact, these are the very calumnies which we find to have been brought against the early Christians--idolatries and all. The filthy idolatry ascribed to the Christians by the heathen may be found recorded in Tertullian's <span class= "ital">Apology, </span>and (so it is said) on the walls of Pompeii. But what, then, does St. Peter mean when he says that the past is sufficient to have perpetrated what the heathen wanted? It certainly implies that some of them had, even since their conversion, been doing what the malicious heathen would be glad to see them do. But we have already noticed that he is speaking ironically in using the word "sufficient," and the irony continues through the rest of the clause. "Some of you have been living, up to the present time, more or less to human lusts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-2.htm" title="That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.">1Peter 4:2</a>). You have done so quite long enough now. You have quite sufficiently gratified the Gentiles, who long to prove that you are no better than themselves." The argument is like that which Nestor, in Homer, addresses to the wrangling Greek captains:--<p>"Sure Priam would rejoice, and Priam's sons,<p>Could they but learn this feud betwixt you twain."<p>We may observe, further, that all through the Epistle St. Peter appears to have dread of a doctrine which was fast beginning to rise among the Asiatic Christians--that such sins as fornication and idolatry, being but bodily, were venial, especially in time of persecution. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-4.htm" title="To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for you,">1Peter 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-15.htm" title="But as he which has called you is holy, so be you holy in all manner of conversation;">1Peter 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1Peter 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm" title="Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour:">1Peter 5:8</a>.) Such pernicious doctrine was probably founded on a "wresting" of St. Paul's teaching (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-16.htm" title="As also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.">2Peter 3:16</a>) on eating things offered to idols; from which it was concluded that the accompanying impurities were innocent likewise. This doctrine becomes very prominent in the Second Epistle; and in the Apocalypse there is even some reason to connect it specially with the Jewish element in the Church. (Comp. together <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-15.htm" title="Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;">2Peter 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-6.htm" title="But this you have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.">Revelation 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/2-14.htm" title="But I have a few things against you, because you have there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.">Revelation 2:14-15</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-9.htm" title="I know your works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but you are rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.">Revelation 2:9</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles</span>; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">the time past may suffice.</span> The words, "of our life" and "us," are not found in the best manuscripts. St. Peter could not include himself among those who wrought the will of the Gentiles. The Greek word for "will" here is, according to the best manuscripts, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>; in ver. 2 "the will of God" is <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. The general distinction is that <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> implies choice and purpose, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> merely inclination (compare, in the Greek, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-13.htm">Philemon 1:13, 14</a>). The change of word seems to point to such a distinction here. God's will is a fixed, holy purpose; the will, or rather wish, of the Gentiles was uncertain inclination, turned this way or that way by changeful lusts. The perfect infinitive, "to have wrought," implies that that part of life ought to be regarded as a thing wholly past and gone. The whole sentence has a tone of solemn irony. "Fastidium peccati apud resipiscentes" (Bengel); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-21.htm">Romans 6:21</a>. St. Peter is here addressing Gentile Christians. Fronm&uuml;ller's objection is peculiar: "Suppose that the readers of Peter's Epistle had formerly been heathens, his reproaching them with having formerly done the will of the Gentiles would surely be singular." They had done the will of the Gentiles; they were now, as Christians, to do the will of God. When we walked in lasciviousness, <span class="cmt_word">lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings,</span> and abominable idolatries; better, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">and to have walked.</span> There is no pronoun. Lusts are the hidden sins of unclean thought, which lead to outbreaks of lasciviousness. The Greek word for "revellings" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) is one often used of drunken youths parading the streets, or of festal processions in honor of Bacchus. The word translated "banquetings" means rather "drinking-bouts." The word for "abominable" is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, unlawful, nefarious, contrary to the eternal principles of the Divine Law; "quibus sanctissimum Dei jus violatur" (Bengel). St. Peter is probably referring, not only to the sin of idolatry in itself, but also to the many licentious practices connected with it. After the persecution of Nero, in which St. Peter perished, Christianity was regarded by the state as a <span class="accented">religio illicita.</span> Christianity was condemned by the law of Rome; idolatry is opposed to the eternal Law of God. This verse could not have been addressed to Hebrew Christians. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-6 The strongest and best arguments against sin, are taken from the sufferings of Christ. He died to destroy sin; and though he cheerfully submitted to the worst sufferings, yet he never gave way to the least sin. Temptations could not prevail, were it not for man's own corruption; but true Christians make the will of God, not their own lust or desires, the rule of their lives and actions. And true conversion makes a marvellous change in the heart and life. It alters the mind, judgment, affections, and conversation. When a man is truly converted, it is very grievous to him to think how the time past of his life has been spent. One sin draws on another. Six sins are here mentioned which have dependence one upon another. It is a Christian's duty, not only to keep from gross wickedness, but also from things that lead to sin, or appear evil. The gospel had been preached to those since dead, who by the proud and carnal judgment of wicked men were condemned as evil-doers, some even suffering death. But being quickened to Divine life by the Holy Spirit, they lived to God as his devoted servants. Let not believers care, though the world scorns and reproaches them.</body></html>
