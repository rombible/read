(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-16.htm" title="Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.">1Peter 4:16</a>.) Again, see how St. Peter presses the Messianic title: surely they will not abandon the hopes of Israel!<p><span class= "bld">The spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you.</span>--He is called the "Spirit of glory" here in the same way as He is called the "Spirit of truth" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-17.htm" title="Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it sees him not, neither knows him: but you know him; for he dwells with you, and shall be in you.">John 14:17</a>), the "Spirit of holiness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm" title="And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:">Romans 1:4</a>), the "Spirit of grace" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-29.htm" title="Of how much sorer punishment, suppose you, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done despite to the Spirit of grace?">Hebrews 10:29</a>), &c. It expresses that glory--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the triumphant manifestation of perfections--is His <span class= "ital">gift</span> and His distinguishing sign and the atmosphere in which He lives. "Glory" stands in contrast with "reproach." And lest it should be doubted who was meant by the splendid phrase, the Apostle adds, "and of God." All "glory" is His, and therefore the Spirit which is the "Spirit of glory" can be no other than the "Spirit of God;" but as God Himself is greater than His own glory, the words form a climax, and it means more to call Him the "Spirit of God" than to call Him the "Spirit of glory." And this Spirit "resteth" upon the persecuted Christians. It means far more than "remaineth" or "abideth." It expresses the complete repose and satisfaction with which the Spirit of glory abides on men who have the hearts of martyrs. "This shall be My rest for ever: here will I dwell, for I have a delight therein." It is the word which is used of the quiet retreat which our Lord took after John's death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-31.htm" title="And he said to them, Come you yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.">Mark 6:31</a>; of the calm relief which He offers to the weary souls who come to Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/11-28.htm" title="Come to me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.">Matthew 11:28-29</a>); of the repose of the blessed dead after the work of life is over (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-11.htm" title="And white robes were given to every one of them; and it was said to them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brothers, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.">Revelation 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-13.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from now on: Yes, said the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.">Revelation 14:13</a>). In the Old Testament it is used of the Spirit in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-25.htm" title="And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the spirit that was on him, and gave it to the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested on them, they prophesied, and did not cease.">Numbers 11:25</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-15.htm" title="And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah does rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.">2Kings 2:15</a>; but, above all, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm" title="And the spirit of the LORD shall rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;">Isaiah 11:2</a>, which was probably in St. Peter's mind. And the argument is, that reproach for the name of the Christ is a proof of glory in reserve, or rather, already belonging to the man. Perhaps St. Peter intentionally hints (in speaking of the "Spirit") that all who make themselves partakers of Christ's reproach are made partakers of His chrism.<p><span class= "bld">On their part.</span>--These words, to the end of the verse, are an undoubted interpolation, though of very early date, appearing even in St. Cyprian's works. The clause would bring out the different view taken by believers and unbelievers of the martyr-spirit. Pliny says in his letter that, whatever Christianity itself may be, there can be no doubt such <span class= "ital">obstinacy</span> ought to be punished. Marcus Aurelius speaks with contempt of the spirit in which Christians suffered themselves to be put to death as mere self-will, unlike the philosophical grace of the Stoics. Gibbon speaks of the "pious obstinacy" of St. Felix of Tibiura.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If ye be reproached for the Name of Christ, happy are ye</span>; rather, <span class="accented">if ye are reviled in the -Name of Christ, blessed are ye.</span> There is, again, a manifest quotation of our Lord's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-11.htm">Matthew 5:11</a>. The conjunction "if" does not imply any doubt: the words mean "when ye are reviled." For "in the Name of Christ," camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-41.htm">Mark 9:41</a>, "Whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my Name, because ye belong to Christ." So here the meaning is, "<span class="accented">When</span> ye are reviled because ye belong to Christ, because ye bear his Name, because ye are Christians" (camp, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you</span>. The form of the sentence in the Greek is unusual. Some regard the first clause, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, as a periphrasis for <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>, and translate, "For glory and the Spirit of God resteth upon you." But there is no other instance of such a periphrasis in the New Testament (Winer, 3:18. 3); it is better to supply <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. <span class="accented">M</span>en revile them, but God glorifieth them. The Spirit of glory, the Spirit which hath the glorious attributes of God, the Spirit which proceedeth from the Father who dwelleth in the glory, in the Shechinah, - that Spirit resteth upon them, and sheds on them the glory of holy suffering, the glory which hung around the cross of Christ. Two of the most ancient manuscripts, with some others, insert the words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, "the Spirit of glory, and of power, and of God." The Spirit is power from on high (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-49.htm">Luke 24:49</a>). (For "resteth," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>.) <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> with the accusative suggests the thought of the Spirit descending upon them and resting there (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32, 33</a>). The Spirit abides upon those who patiently suffer for Christ. <span class="cmt_word">On their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.</span> These words are not found in the most ancient manuscripts, and are probably a gloss, lint a true one. Those who reviled the suffering Christians really blasphemed the Holy Spirit of God, by whom they were strengthened; the Holy Spirit was glorified by their patient endurance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:12-19 By patience and fortitude in suffering, by dependence on the promises of God, and keeping to the word the Holy Spirit hath revealed, the Holy Spirit is glorified; but by the contempt and reproaches cast upon believers, he is evil spoken of, and is blasphemed. One would think such cautions as these were needless to Christians. But their enemies falsely charged them with foul crimes. And even the best of men need to be warned against the worst of sins. There is no comfort in sufferings, when we bring them upon ourselves by our own sin and folly. A time of universal calamity was at hand, as foretold by our Saviour, Mt 24:9,10. And if such things befall in this life, how awful will the day of judgment be! It is true that the righteous are scarcely saved; even those who endeavour to walk uprightly in the ways of God. This does not mean that the purpose and performance of God are uncertain, but only the great difficulties and hard encounters in the way; that they go through so many temptations and tribulations, so many fightings without and fears within. Yet all outward difficulties would be as nothing, were it not for lusts and corruptions within. These are the worst clogs and troubles. And if the way of the righteous be so hard, then how hard shall be the end of the ungodly sinner, who walks in sin with delight, and thinks the righteous is a fool for all his pains! The only way to keep the soul well, is, to commit it to God by prayer, and patient perseverance in well-doing. He will overrule all to the final advantage of the believer.</body></html>
