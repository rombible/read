The judgment is just about to begin, and all those who bear the name of Christians may well be thankful that they do.<p><span class= "bld">That judgment.</span>--It should be, <span class= "ital">that the judgment</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the great judgment which we all expect. The word "begin," however, shows that in St. Peter's mind it would be a long process; and he probably does not distinguish in his mind between the "burning which is befalling for a trial" and the final judgment, except that that "burning" is but the beginning. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-5.htm" title="Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.">1Peter 4:5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Begin at the house of God.</span>--The phrase contains an obvious reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-6.htm" title="Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man on whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.">Ezekiel 9:6</a> (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-29.htm" title="For, see, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should you be utterly unpunished? You shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword on all the inhabitants of the earth, said the LORD of hosts.">Jeremiah 25:29</a>). Who are meant by the "house of God" is clear, not only from such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1Peter 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?">1Corinthians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.">2Thessalonians 2:4</a>, but also from the immediate addition, "and if first <span class= "ital">at us.</span>" We who are <span class= "ital">Chrestiani, </span>who bear the mark of the Christ's shame upon our foreheads, and are not ashamed of it, are quite safe in this judgment: "come not near any man upon whom is the mark." The sense is a little closely packed. It seems as if St. Peter meant at first only to say, "Thank God that you <span class= "ital">are</span> 'Christians,' for the judgment is just about to begin," as something which only concerns the unbelievers; then, as an afterthought, he adds, "and begin, too, at the house of God," by way of making the believers also feel the need of care.<p><span class= "bld">And if it first begin at us, what shall the end be . . .?</span>--It is more expressive to omit, with St. Peter, the verb "begin ": <span class= "ital">and if first at us.</span> The argument is: "If we, who are the very household of God, must undergo this searching investigation first, what will happen, as the judgment nears its climax, to those who," &c.? When he says "<span class= "ital">the end</span> of those that obey not," he does not mean exactly "the final doom of those that obey not," as contrasted with "the end" of those that obey, or as contrasted with their own earlier opportunities: rather, "the end" is the end of the great process of judgment, as contrasted with the "beginning first at us." The judging of the house of God has now gone on for eighteen hundred years, but it has not yet touched those who are without.<p><span class= "bld">That obey not the gospel of God?</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">that disobey the gospel of God</span>?. The word is the same which we have noticed several times (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-1.htm" title="Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;">1Peter 3:1</a>) as being peculiarly applied to the Jews. Now the object of this mysterious threat (which is made more terrible by being thrown into the form of a question) is not only to solace the persecuted by the thought of God being their avenger, but to warn them against slipping into the position of those thus threatened. The recipients of the Letter, we must recollect, were Jewish Christians, who were in a two-fold danger--either of relapsing sullenly into Judaism, or of plunging into heathen excesses, like the Nicolaitan school, under the notion that such things could not hurt the spiritually-minded. To meet these two forms of danger, the Apostle hints darkly at the punishment of the two classes in this phrase and in the verse following, precisely as St. Paul, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm" title="In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:">2Thessalonians 1:8</a> (see Note there), divides the wicked to be punished into Jew and Gentile, or, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-9.htm" title="Tribulation and anguish, on every soul of man that does evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;">Romans 2:9</a>, still more particularly. And that he is thinking specially of unbelieving <span class= "ital">Jews</span> in this place appears from the context in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-6.htm" title="Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man on whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.">Ezekiel 9:6</a> (especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-9.htm" title="Use hospitality one to another without grudging.">1Peter 4:9</a>), where the separation to be effected is not between Jew and Gentile, but between Jew and Jew--those "that sigh and that cry for all the abominations" committed by Israel, and those that commit the abominations. As Bengel remarks, "The persecution of Nero was but a few years before the catastrophe of the Jews."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God.</span> The house of God is the Church (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>). The judgment must begin at the sanctuary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-6.htm">Ezekiel 9:6</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15-29</a>). The beginning of judgment is the persecution of the Christians, as our Lord had taught (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-8.htm">Matthew 24:8, 9</a>, and following verses); but that judgment is not unto condemnation: "When we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-32.htm">1 Corinthians 11:32</a>); it is the fiery trial, "which is much more precious than of gold that perisheth," the refining fire of affliction. And if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? Compare the passage in Jeremiah already referred to: "Behold, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my Name, and should ye be utterly unpunished?" Compare also our Lord's question, "If they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?" Gerhard (quoted by Huther) rightly remarks," Exaggeratio est in interrogatione." The question suggests answers too awful for words. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:12-19 By patience and fortitude in suffering, by dependence on the promises of God, and keeping to the word the Holy Spirit hath revealed, the Holy Spirit is glorified; but by the contempt and reproaches cast upon believers, he is evil spoken of, and is blasphemed. One would think such cautions as these were needless to Christians. But their enemies falsely charged them with foul crimes. And even the best of men need to be warned against the worst of sins. There is no comfort in sufferings, when we bring them upon ourselves by our own sin and folly. A time of universal calamity was at hand, as foretold by our Saviour, Mt 24:9,10. And if such things befall in this life, how awful will the day of judgment be! It is true that the righteous are scarcely saved; even those who endeavour to walk uprightly in the ways of God. This does not mean that the purpose and performance of God are uncertain, but only the great difficulties and hard encounters in the way; that they go through so many temptations and tribulations, so many fightings without and fears within. Yet all outward difficulties would be as nothing, were it not for lusts and corruptions within. These are the worst clogs and troubles. And if the way of the righteous be so hard, then how hard shall be the end of the ungodly sinner, who walks in sin with delight, and thinks the righteous is a fool for all his pains! The only way to keep the soul well, is, to commit it to God by prayer, and patient perseverance in well-doing. He will overrule all to the final advantage of the believer.</body></html>
