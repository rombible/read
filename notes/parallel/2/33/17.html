Moses is rewarded for his importunity. God's people have found grace in His sight. He will "go up" with them, and so "separate them," or distinguish them, from "all the people that are on the face of the earth." Now at last Moses is satisfied.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will do this thing also</span>. "I will extend my favour to thy people also, and distinguish them, as well as thee, by going up with them. I will do this for thy sake, because <span class="cmt_word">thou hast found grace in my sight</span>." Moses' petition is at last fully granted - the threat of withdrawal cancelled - the promise of <span class="accented">Divine</span> guidance and protection renewed <span class="cmt_word">I know thee by name</span>. It is a supreme favour for God to know us <span class="accented">by name</span>. It marks "a specifically personal relation to God" (Keil). The expression is perhaps taken from the phraseology of Oriental Courts, where not one in a hundred of the courtiers is known to the monarch by name. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 33:18-23 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:12-23 Moses is very earnest with God. Thus, by the intercession of Christ, we are not only saved from ruin, but become entitled to everlasting happiness. Observe here how he pleads. We find grace in God's sight, if we find grace in our hearts to guide and quicken us in the way of our duty. Moses speaks as one who dreaded the thought of going forward without the Lord's presence. God's gracious promises, and mercy towards us, should not only encourage our faith, but also excite our fervency in prayer. Observe how he speeds. See, in a type, Christ's intercession, which he ever lives to make for all that come to God by him; and that it is not by any thing in those for whom he intercedes. Moses then entreats a sight of God's glory, and is heard in that also. A full discovery of the glory of God, would overwhelm even Moses himself. Man is mean, and unworthy of it; weak, and could not bear it; guilty, and could not but dread it. The merciful display which is made in Christ Jesus, alone can be borne by us. The Lord granted that which would abundantly satisfy. God's goodness is his glory; and he will have us to know him by the glory of his mercy, more than by the glory of his majesty. Upon the rock there was a fit place for Moses to view the goodness and glory of God. The rock in Horeb was typical of Christ the Rock; the Rock of refuge, salvation, and strength. Happy are they who stand upon this Rock. The cleft may be an emblem of Christ, as smitten, crucified, wounded, and slain. What follows, denotes the imperfect knowledge of God in the present state, even as revealed in Christ; for this, when compared with the heavenly sight of him. is but like seeing a man that is gone by, whose back only is to be seen. God in Christ, as he is, even the fullest and brightest displays of his glory, grace, and goodness, are reserved to another state.</body></html>
