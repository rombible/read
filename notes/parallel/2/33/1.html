In the "Book of the Covenant" He had promised to go up with them by an Angel, in whom was His Name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/23-20.htm" title="Behold, I send an Angel before you, to keep you in the way, and to bring you into the place which I have prepared.">Exodus 23:20-23</a>): <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>by His Son, the Second Person in the Holy Trinity. He now, to mark His displeasure, withdrew this promise, and substituted for the Divine presence that of a mere angel. "I will send an angel before thee" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-2.htm" title="And I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:">Exodus 33:2</a>); "I will not go up in the midst of thee" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-3.htm" title="To a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the middle of you; for you are a stiff necked people: lest I consume you in the way.">Exodus 33:3</a>). Dimly the people felt the importance of the change, the vast difference between the angelic and the Divine, and "mourned" their loss (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-4.htm" title="And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.">Exodus 33:4</a>). mourned with some touch of real godly sorrow, and, as was the custom of the Orientals in mourning (Terent. <span class= "ital">Heaut</span>. ii. 3, 47; Herodian. iv. 2, &c.), "put off their ornaments."<p>(1) <span class= "bld">The Lord said unto Moses</span>.--In continuation and explanation of the words recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/32-33.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Whoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.">Exodus 32:33-34</a>, but probably at another time, after Moses had once more descended from the Ras Sufsafeh to the plain at its base.<p><span class= "bld">The land which I sware unto Abraham . . . --</span>The misconduct of Israel in their worship of the calf would not annul the promises of God to the patriarchs. These He was bound to make good. "The Lord sware, and will not repent" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - THE THREAT OF GOD'S WITHDRAWAL, AND THE HUMILIATION OF THE PEOPLE. The intercession of Moses, and his offer to sacrifice himself for his people had obtained from God some great concessions, viz. - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That the people's lives should be spared (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-14.htm">Exodus 32:14</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> And that they should be led into Palestine (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 34) But a change had been introduced into the conditions under which the future journeys were to be made, somewhat obscurely indicated in the words - "Behold, mine angel shall go before thee" (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>) - which was now to be more distinctly set forth. "God's angel" may mean his Presence in the Person of his Son - as it appears to mean in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20-23</a> - or it may mean simply one of the created angelic host, which seems to be its sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-34.htm">Exodus 32:34</a>, and in ver. 2 of this chapter. By vers. 2 and 3 taken in combination it was rendered manifest, both to Moses and to the people (ver. 4), that they were threatened with the loss of God's actual presence and personal protection during the remainder of their wanderings, and would have, instead of it, the mere guidance and help of an angel in the inferior sense of the word. This was felt to be "evil tidings" and the people consequently "mourned" and "stripped themselves of their ornaments" (ver. 6). Real penitence at last entered their hearts, and led to self-abasement. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> <span class="cmt_word">The Lord said unto Moses</span>.

Let them go forward as they are; this was very expressive of God's displeasure. Though he promises to make good his covenant with Abraham, in giving them Canaan, yet he denies them the tokens of his presence they had been blessed with. The people mourned for their sin. Of all the bitter fruits and consequences of sin, true penitents most lament, and dread most, God's departure from them. Canaan itself would be no pleasant land without the Lord's presence. Those who parted with ornaments to maintain sin, could do no less than lay aside ornaments, in token of sorrow and shame for it.</body></html>
