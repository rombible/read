and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?">Numbers 12:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-10.htm" title="And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like to Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>. This is clearly spoken of as a privilege peculiar to Moses; but in what exactly the peculiarity consisted is not apparent. Some special closeness of approach is no doubt meant--some nearness such as had been enjoyed by no mortal previously. In later times, Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/6-1.htm" title="In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.">Isaiah 6:1-5</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-28.htm" title="As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about.

After each conference, Moses returned to the camp, where, no doubt, he had put up for himself another tent, and where his presence was needed He left, however, his personal attendant ("minister"), Joshua, to watch and guard the sacred structure during his absence. It is remarkable that the trust was committed to Joshua, rather than to Aaron, or any of the Levites. Probably the reason of this was, that Joshua alone had had no paw in the idolatry of the calf. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-17.htm">Exodus 32:17</a>.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 33:12-17 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:7-11 Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp. This seems to have been a temporary building, set up for worship, and at which he judged disputes among the people. The people looked after him; they were very desirous to be at peace with God, and concerned to know what would come to pass. The cloudy pillar which had withdrawn from the camp when it was polluted with idolatry, now returned. If our hearts go forth toward God to meet him, he will graciously come to meet us.</body></html>
