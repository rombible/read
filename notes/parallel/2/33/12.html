He was now ready to be entreated. Moses therefore renews his supplications on their behalf, and especially prays for a revocation of the threatened withdrawal of the Divine Presence, and substitution for it of a mere angel. Taking advantage of his privilege to speak to God as friend with friend (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-11.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.">Exodus 33:11</a>), he ventures to expostulate, uses familiar terms, and persists until he at last obtains a distinct declaration that his request is granted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-17.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, I will do this thing also that you have spoken: for you have found grace in my sight, and I know you by name.">Exodus 33:17</a>).<p>(12) <span class= "bld">Thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send.</span>--Moses finds the promises of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-34.htm" title="Therefore now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you: behold, my Angel shall go before you: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin on them.">Exodus 32:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-2.htm" title="And I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:">Exodus 33:2</a> ambiguous.

Is it the "Angel" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/23-20.htm" title="Behold, I send an Angel before you, to keep you in the way, and to bring you into the place which I have prepared.">Exodus 23:20-23</a>, or no?

And he said, Here am I.">Exodus 3:4</a>), and again, probably, when he "called unto him out of the midst of the cloud" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-16.htm" title="And the glory of the LORD stayed on mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called to Moses out of the middle of the cloud.">Exodus 24:16</a>); but the exact phrase had not been used previously. It implies a very high degree of Divine favour. God "knows by name" only those whom He greatly regards. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-2.htm" title="See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:">Exodus 31:2</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-17.</span> - THE REVOCATION OF THE THREAT OF WITHDRAWAL. After some days' "wrestling with God" in the "tent of meeting," Moses prayed to know definitely what God had determined on. "Show me thy way," he said (ver. 13) - "Whom wilt thou send with me?" To this demand, God made the gracious reply - "My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest" (ver. 14). This was satisfactory, except that it did not distinctly include the conduct of the people - it might be merely a promise to himself. So Moses (vers. 15, 16) requires a more explicit assurance, and, closely associating the people with himself, declares that he will not move a step further, unless God allows the people to find grace in his sight, and consents to "distinguish" them by "going up" with them. Then at length God yields and gives the assurance" I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken" (ver. 17) - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "I will go up visibly with the people and distinguish them." (See the comment on ver. 16.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">See, thou sayest</span>. Moses takes advantage of his privilege of speaking as friend with friend, and uses familiar terms - "See," he says, "thou hast told me to conduct the people to Canaan, yet thou hast not made it clear whom thou wilt send with me. If it is to be an angel, <span class="accented">what</span> angel? Why not the angel of the original promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20-23</a>)? Thou hast distinguished <span class="accented">me</span> with thy favour - <span class="cmt_word">Consider that this nation is thy people</span>, and extend thy favour to them. At any rate <span class="cmt_word">shew me thy way</span> - tell me plainly what thou wilt do." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:12-23 Moses is very earnest with God. Thus, by the intercession of Christ, we are not only saved from ruin, but become entitled to everlasting happiness. Observe here how he pleads. We find grace in God's sight, if we find grace in our hearts to guide and quicken us in the way of our duty. Moses speaks as one who dreaded the thought of going forward without the Lord's presence. God's gracious promises, and mercy towards us, should not only encourage our faith, but also excite our fervency in prayer. Observe how he speeds. See, in a type, Christ's intercession, which he ever lives to make for all that come to God by him; and that it is not by any thing in those for whom he intercedes. Moses then entreats a sight of God's glory, and is heard in that also. A full discovery of the glory of God, would overwhelm even Moses himself. Man is mean, and unworthy of it; weak, and could not bear it; guilty, and could not but dread it. The merciful display which is made in Christ Jesus, alone can be borne by us. The Lord granted that which would abundantly satisfy. God's goodness is his glory; and he will have us to know him by the glory of his mercy, more than by the glory of his majesty. Upon the rock there was a fit place for Moses to view the goodness and glory of God. The rock in Horeb was typical of Christ the Rock; the Rock of refuge, salvation, and strength. Happy are they who stand upon this Rock. The cleft may be an emblem of Christ, as smitten, crucified, wounded, and slain. What follows, denotes the imperfect knowledge of God in the present state, even as revealed in Christ; for this, when compared with the heavenly sight of him. is but like seeing a man that is gone by, whose back only is to be seen. God in Christ, as he is, even the fullest and brightest displays of his glory, grace, and goodness, are reserved to another state.</body></html>
