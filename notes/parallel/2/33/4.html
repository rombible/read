It is natural for sinful men to shrink from the near presence of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-34.htm" title="And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they sought him that he would depart out of their coasts.">Matthew 8:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-8.htm" title="When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.">Luke 5:8</a>); and so the Israelites had shrunk from it a short time previously (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-19.htm" title="And they said to Moses, Speak you with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.">Exodus 20:19</a>). Even now they would probably have feared a too near contact; but still, they were unwilling that God should cease to be the leader and guide of the host: they set a value on His presence and protection, which they felt that that of an angel would ill replace. Accordingly, when Moses communicated to them what God had said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/33-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Depart, and go up hence, you and the people which you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To your seed will I give it:">Exodus 33:1-3</a>), they "mourned," <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, not only grieved inwardly, but showed the outward tokens of grief--made a public and, as it were, national lamentation.<p><span class= "bld">No man did put on him his ornaments.</span>--The Orientals, both men and women, have always affected ornament, and taken an extreme delight in it. Herodotus tells us that the Persians who accompanied Xerxes into Greece wore generally collars and bracelets of gold (<span class= "ital">Hist. ix.</span> 80). Xenophon says that the Medes indulged a similar taste (<span class= "ital">Cyrop?d</span>. i. 3, ? 2). In Egypt, at the time of the exodus, men of station wore generally collars, armlets, and bracelets, occasionally anklets. The Assyrians wore armlets, bracelets, and ear-rings. To strip himself of his ornaments was a great act of self-denial on the part of an Oriental; but it was done commonly in the case of mourning on account of a family bereavement, and sometimes in the case of national misfortunes. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/33-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Depart, and go up hence, you and the people which you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To your seed will I give it:">Exodus 33:1-6</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When</span> <span class="cmt_word">the people heard.</span> Moses had communicated to the people what God had said to him. They felt it to be <span class="cmt_word">evil tidings</span> - they woke up at last to a feeling of the ineffable value of the privileges which they bad hitherto enjoyed - his guidance by the pillar of the cloud (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>) - his counsel, if there were need to ask anything (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-25.htm">Exodus 15:25</a>) - his aid in the day of battle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-13</a>) - his near presence, by day and by night, constantly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-22.htm">Exodus 13:22</a>) - and they dreaded a change, which they felt must involve a loss, and one the extent of which they could not measure. "An angel" is a poor consolation when we are craving for Jehovah! So the people <span class="cmt_word">mourned</span> - felt true sorrow - were really troubled in their hearts - and, to show their penitence, ceased to wear their customary <span class="cmt_word">ornaments</span>. These may have consisted of armlets, bracelets, and even, perhaps, anklets, all of which were worn by men in Egypt at this period. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:1-6 Those whom God pardons, must be made to know what their sin deserved. Let them go forward as they are; this was very expressive of God's displeasure. Though he promises to make good his covenant with Abraham, in giving them Canaan, yet he denies them the tokens of his presence they had been blessed with. The people mourned for their sin. Of all the bitter fruits and consequences of sin, true penitents most lament, and dread most, God's departure from them. Canaan itself would be no pleasant land without the Lord's presence. Those who parted with ornaments to maintain sin, could do no less than lay aside ornaments, in token of sorrow and shame for it.</body></html>
