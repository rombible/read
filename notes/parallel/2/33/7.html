Months would necessarily elapse before the Tabernacle could be constructed according to the pattern which he had seen in the mount. During this interval he determined to make use of one of the existing tents as a "house of prayer," severing it from the others, and giving it the name "Tent of Meeting," which was afterwards appropriated to the Tabernacle. It would seem that he selected his own tent for the purpose--probably because it was the best that the camp afforded--and contented himself with another. God deigned to approve his design, and descended in the cloudy pillar on the tent each time that Moses entered it.<p>(7) <span class= "bld">Moses took the tabernacle.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">Moses took his tent. </span>The Hebrew article, like the Greek, has often the force of the possessive pronoun.

He gave it--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, by anticipation--the identical name by which the "Tabernacle" was afterwards commonly known. It was, in fact, a temporary substitute for the Tabernacle.<p><span class= "bld">Every one . . . went out unto the tabernacle.</span>--Though he had designed it for his own special use, Moses allowed all Israel to make use of it also.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-11.</span> - THE FIRST ERECTION OF A TABERNACLE. The decision of the matter still hung in suspense. God had not revoked his threat to withdraw himself and leave the host to the conduct of an angel. He had merely reserved his final decision (ver. 5). Moses was anxious to wrestle with him in prayer until he obtained the reversal of this sentence; but he could not be always ascending Sinai, when the camp needed his superintending care, and the camp as yet contained no place of worship, where a man could pray and be secure against disturbance. Moses, under these circumstances, with the tabernacle in his mind, but without leisure to construct it, contrived "for the present distress" a temporary tabernacle or tent. He took, apparently, the tent that had hitherto been his own, and removed it to a position outside the camp, erecting it there, and at the same time giving it the name of "the tent of meeting" (ver. 7). Hither he decreed that all persons should come who desired communion with God (ver. 7), and hither he resorted himself for the same purpose (ver. 8). It pleased God to approve these arrangements; and to show his approval by a visible token. Whenever Moses entered the "tent of meeting," the pillar of the cloud descended from the top of Sinai, and took up its station at the door of the tent (ver. 9), thus securing Moses from interruption. At the sight the people "worshipped," each at his tent's door, while Moses was privileged to speak with God "face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend" (ver. 11). Joshua accompanied him on the first occasion, and remained behind, to guard the tent, when Moses left it (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moses</span> <span class="cmt_word">took the tabernacle.</span> The "tabernacle" proper was not yet constructed. (See chs. 35-40.) And the word used is not that properly rendered "tabernacle" - viz., <span class="accented">mishkan</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>); but the far more common word <span class="accented">ohel</span>, which means "tent." The proper translation would be, "Moses took the tent." But the question at once arises - What tent? It is suggested that the article may have the force of the possessive pronoun, and indicate that he took "his tent." (Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-10.htm">Matthew 9:10</a>, where "<span class="accented">the</span> house" undoubtedly means "<span class="accented">his</span> house.") Moses took his own tent, probably as the best in the encampment, and converted it to a sacred use, transferring his own abode to another. <span class="cmt_word">Afar off from the camp</span>. The sacred and the profane must not approach each other too closely - an interval must be set between them. But the distance, evidently, was not great (ver. 10). <span class="cmt_word">The tabernacle of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the congregation.</span> Rather, "the tent of meeting" or "of conference" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the tent in which he expected to meet and converse with God. See the comment on Exodus 27:21. <span class="cmt_word">Every one which sought the Lord went out.</span> Moses must have commanded this. The "tent" was not to be a mere oratory for himself, but open to all Israelites. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:7-11 Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp. This seems to have been a temporary building, set up for worship, and at which he judged disputes among the people. The people looked after him; they were very desirous to be at peace with God, and concerned to know what would come to pass. The cloudy pillar which had withdrawn from the camp when it was polluted with idolatry, now returned. If our hearts go forth toward God to meet him, he will graciously come to meet us.</body></html>
