Moses consented, and in course of time took to wife Zipporah, one of Reuel's daughters. Marriage with the Midianites was allowed, even under the Law. It has been conjectured that Reuel might have communicated to Moses traditions, or even documents concerning their common ancestor, Abraham, and his family. But there is nothing to indicate the use of letters at this early date by the Midianites.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moses was content to dwell with the man</span>. Moses had fled from Egypt without any definite plan, simply to save his life, and had now to determine how he would obtain a subsistence. Received into Reuel's house, or tent, pleased with the man and with his family, he consented to stay with him, probably entered into his service, as Jacob into Laban's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-15.htm">Genesis 29:15-20</a>), kept his sheep, or otherwise made himself useful (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>); and in course of time Reuel <span class="cmt_word">gave Moses his daughter</span>, accepted him for his son-in-law, so that he became not merely a member of his household, but of his family, was adopted probably into the tribe, so that he could not quit it without permission (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-18.htm">Exodus 4:18</a>), and, so far as his own intention went, cast in his lot with the Midianites, with whom he meant henceforth to live and die. Such vague ideas as he may previously have entertained of his "mission" had passed away; he had been "disillusioned" by his ill-success, and now looked forward to nothing but a life of peaceful obscurity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:16-22 Moses found shelter in Midian. He was ready to help Reuel's daughters to water their flocks, although bred in learning and at court. Moses loved to be doing justice, and to act in defence of such as he saw injured, which every man ought to do, as far as it is in his power. He loved to be doing good; wherever the providence of God casts us, we should desire and try to be useful; and when we cannot do the good we would, we must be ready to do the good we can. Moses commended himself to the prince of Midian; who married one of his daughters to Moses, by whom he had a son, called Gershom, a stranger there, that he might keep in remembrance the land in which he had been a stranger.</body></html>
