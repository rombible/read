Mineral pitch, though not a product of Egypt, was imported into the country from Mesopotamia, and was largely used for embalming (Brugsch, <span class= "ital">History of Egypt, </span>vol. i. p. 361).<p><span class= "bld">In the flags.</span>--A rank aquatic vegetation abounds on the Lower Nile, and in all the back-waters and marshy tracts connected with it. Jochebed placed her child "in the flags," that the ark might not float away down the river, and so be lost to her sight. The word used for "flag"--<span class= "ital">suph</span>--seems to be a Hebraised form of <span class= "ital">tufi, </span>a common Egyptian word, having this sense.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">She took for him an ark of bulrushes</span>. The words translated "ark" and "bulrushes" are both of Egyptian origin, the former corresponding to the ordinary word for "chest," which is feb, <span class="accented">teba</span>, or tebat, and the latter corresponding to the Egyptian <span class="accented">kam</span>, which is the same in Coptic, and designates the papyrus plant. This is a strong-growing rush, with a triangular stem, which attains the height of from 10 to 15 feet. The Egyptian paper was made from its pith. The rush itself was used for various purposes - among others for boat-building (Plin. 'H. N.' 6:22; 7:16; Theophrast, 4:9; Pint. 'De Isid. et Osir.' &sect; 18, etc.), as appears from the monuments. It would be a very good material for the sort of purpose to which Jochebed applied it. <span class="cmt_word">She daubed it with slime and with pitch</span>. The word translated "slime" is the same as that used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-3.htm">Genesis 11:3</a>, which is generally thought to mean "mineral pitch" or "bitumen." According to Strabo and Dioderus, that material was largely used by the Egyptians for the embalming of corpses, and was imported into Egypt from Palestine. Boats are sometimes covered with it externally at the present day (Ker Porter, Travels, vol. 2. p. 260; Layard,'Nineveh and its Remains,' pt. 2. ch. 5.); but Jochebed seems to have used vegetable pitch- the ordinary pitch of commerce - for the purpose. Here again the Hebrew word is taken from the Egyptian. <span class="cmt_word">She laid it in the flags</span>. "Suph," the word translated "flags," is a modification of the Egyptian <span class="accented">tuff</span>, which has that meaning. Water-plants of all kinds abound in the backwaters of the Nile. and the marshy tracts communicating with it. The object of placing the ark in a thicket of reeds probably was, that it might not float away out of sight. <span class="cmt_word">The river's brink</span>. Literally<span class="accented">, the lip of the river -</span> an Egyptian idiom. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-4 Observe the order of Providence: just at the time when Pharaoh's cruelty rose to its height by ordering the Hebrew children to be drowned, the deliverer was born. When men are contriving the ruin of the church, God is preparing for its salvation. The parents of Moses saw he was a goodly child. A lively faith can take encouragement from the least hint of the Divine favour. It is said, Heb 11:23, that the parents of Moses hid him by faith; they had the promise that Israel should be preserved, which they relied upon. Faith in God's promise quickens to the use of lawful means for obtaining mercy. Duty is ours, events are God's. Faith in God will set us above the fear of man. At three months' end, when they could not hide the infant any longer, they put him in an ark of bulrushes by the river's brink, and set his sister to watch. And if the weak affection of a mother were thus careful, what shall we think of Him, whose love, whose compassion is, as himself, boundless. Moses never had a stronger protection about him, no, not when all the Israelites were round his tent in the wilderness, than now, when he lay alone, a helpless babe upon the waves. No water, no Egyptian can hurt him. When we seem most neglected and forlorn, God is most present with us.</body></html>
