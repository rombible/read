The order is different from that observed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46.htm">Genesis 46</a>, and seems intended to do honour to legitimate, as opposed to secondary, wedlock. The omission of Joseph follows necessarily from the exact form of the opening phrase, "These are the names of the children of Israel, which <span class="accented">came into Egypt with Jacob."</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- All the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls</span>. This is manifestly intended as a repetition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-27.htm">Genesis 46:27</a>, and throws the reader back upon the details there adduced, which make up the exact number of "seventy souls," by the inclusion of Jacob himself, of Joseph, and of Joseph's two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. The inaccuracy by which Jacob is counted among his own descendants, is thoroughly Oriental and Hebraistic, however opposed to Western habits of thought. To stumble at it shows a narrow and carping spirit. (Compare note on Genesis 46:15.) <span class="cmt_word">For Joseph was in Egypt already</span>. Joseph, <span class="accented">i.e</span>., has not been mentioned with the other sons of Jacob, since he did not "come into Egypt with Jacob," but was there previously. The transfer of the clause to the commencement of the verse, which is made by the LXX., is unnecessary. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 During more than 200 years, while Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob lived at liberty, the Hebrews increased slowly; only about seventy persons went down into Egypt. There, in about the same number of years, though under cruel bondage, they became a large nation. This wonderful increase was according to the promise long before made unto the fathers. Though the performance of God's promises is sometimes slow, it is always sure.</body></html>
