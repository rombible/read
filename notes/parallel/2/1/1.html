Genesis ends naturally and Exodus begins at the point where the history of the individuals who founded the Israelite nation ceases and that of the nation itself is entered on. That history commences properly with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-7.htm" title="And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.">Exodus 1:7</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/1-1.htm" title="Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.">Exodus 1:1-6</a> form the connecting link between the two books, and would not have been needed unless Exodus had been introduced as a distinct work, since they are little more than a recapitulation of what had been already stated and stated more fully in Genesis. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/1-1.htm" title="Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.">Exodus 1:1-5</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/46-8.htm" title="And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.">Genesis 46:8-27</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-6.htm" title="And Joseph died, and all his brothers, and all that generation.">Exodus 1:6</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm" title="And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.">Genesis 1:26</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Every man and his household.</span>--"A household," in the language of the East, includes not only children and grand-children, but retainers also--"servants born in the house"--like those of Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-14.htm" title="And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them to Dan.">Genesis 14:14</a>). The number of each "household" may thus have been very considerable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now these are the names</span>. Literally, "And these are the names." Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-8.htm">Genesis 46:8</a>, where the phrase used is the same. We have here the first example of that almost <span class="accented">universal</span> practice of fife writers of the Historical Scriptures to connect book with book in the closest possible way by the simple copulative "and." (Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-1.htm">Joshua 1:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>, Ruth, Samuel, Kings, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther.) This practice, so unlike that of secular writers, can only be explained by the instinctive feeling of all, that they were contributors to a <span class="accented">single</span> book, each later writer a continuator of the narrative placed on record by his predecessor. In the Pentateuch, if we admit a single author, the initial <span class="accented">vau</span> will be less remarkable, since it will merely serve to join together the different sections of a single treatise. <span class="cmt_word">Which came into Egypt</span>. The next two words of the original, "with Jacob," belong properly to this clause. The whole verse is best translated, "Now these are the names of the children of Israel which came into Egypt with Jacob: they came every man with his household." So the LXX., Pagnini, Kalisch, Geddes, Boothroyd, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Every man and his household</span>. This is important in connection with the vexed question of the possible increase of the original band of so-called "Israelites" within the space of 430 years to such a number as is said to have quitted Egypt with Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>). The "household" of Abraham comprised 318 adult males (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14</a>). The "households" of Jacob, his eleven sons, and his numerous grown-up grandsons, have been with reason estimated at "several thousands." (Kurtz, 'History of the Old Covenant,' vol. 2 p. 149, E. T.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 During more than 200 years, while Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob lived at liberty, the Hebrews increased slowly; only about seventy persons went down into Egypt. There, in about the same number of years, though under cruel bondage, they became a large nation. This wonderful increase was according to the promise long before made unto the fathers. Though the performance of God's promises is sometimes slow, it is always sure.</body></html>
