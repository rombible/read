Obeying the command given them (vers. 2, 9), Moses and Aaron went to the court a second time, and entering into the royal presence, probably repeated their demand - as from God - that the king would let the Children of Israel go (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-11.htm">Exodus 6:11</a>), when Pharaoh objected that they had no authority to speak to him in God's name, and required an evidence of their authority, either in the actual words of verse 9 ("Shew a miracle for you"), or in some equivalent ones. Aaron hereupon cast down on the ground the rod which Moses had brought from Midian, and it became a serpent (ver. 10). Possibly Pharaoh may have been prepared for this. He may have been told that this was one among the signs which had been done in the sight of the elders and people of Israel when the two brothers first came back from Midian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-30.htm">Exodus 4:30</a>). If he knew of it, no doubt the "magicians" knew of it, and had prepared themselves. Pharaoh summoned them, as was natural, to his presence, and consulted them with respect to the portent, whereupon they too cast down the rods which they were carrying in their hands, and they "became serpents; but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods" (ver. 12). (For the explanation of those facts, see the comment below). Pharaoh was to some extent impressed by the miracle, but not so as to yield. His heart remained hard, and he refused to let the people go. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Aaron cast down his rod</span>. The rod is called indifferently "Aaron's rod" and "Moses' rod," because, though properly the rod of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-2.htm">Exodus 4:2</a>), yet ordinarily it was placed in the hands of Aaron (vers. 19, 20; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-5.htm">Exodus 8:5, 17</a>, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">It became a serpent</span>. The word for "serpent" is not the same as was used before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-3.htm">Exodus 4:3</a>); but it is not clear that a different species is meant. More probably it is regarded by the writer as a synonym. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:8-13 What men dislike, because it opposes their pride and lusts, they will not be convinced of; but it is easy to cause them to believe things they wish to be true. God always sends with his word full proofs of its Divine authority; but when men are bent to disobey, and willing to object, he often permits a snare to be laid wherein they are entangled. The magicians were cheats, trying to copy the real miracles of Moses by secret sleights or jugglings, which to a small extent they succeeded in doing, so as to deceive the bystanders, but they were at length obliged to confess they could not any longer imitate the effects of Divine power. None assist more in the destruction of sinners, than such as resist the truth by amusing men with a counterfeit resemblance of it. Satan is most to be dreaded when transformed into an angel of light.</body></html>
