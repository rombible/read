No doubt this was one of the main lessons intended to be taught by the whole series of miraculous events connected with the Exodus. Egypt was the greatest monarchy in the whole world. She was now at the height of her glory. Among existent polytheisms, hers was the most famous; and her gods must have seemed, not only to herself, but to all the surrounding nations, the most powerful. To discredit them was to throw discredit upon polytheism generally, and to exalt the name of Jehovah above that of all the deities of the nations.

They will know this and feel this when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, as I am about to stretch it forth. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-7 God glorifies himself. He makes people know that he is Jehovah. Israel is made to know it by the performance of his promises to them, and the Egyptians by the pouring out of his wrath upon them. Moses, as the ambassador of Jehovah, speaking in his name, laid commands upon Pharaoh, denounced threatenings against him, and called for judgments upon him. Pharaoh, proud and great as he was, could not resist. Moses stood not in awe of Pharaoh, but made him tremble. This seems to be meant in the words, Thou shalt be a god unto Pharaoh. At length Moses is delivered from his fears. He makes no more objections, but, being strengthened in faith, goes about his work with courage, and proceeds in it with perseverance.</body></html>
