And Moses said to them, This is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.">Exodus 16:15</a>.) "Manna" is a Greek form, first used by the LXX. translator of Numbers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/11-6.htm" title="And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.">Exodus 11:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-9.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Pharaoh shall not listen to you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.">Exodus 11:9</a>).<p><span class= "bld">It was like coriander seed.</span>--The appearance of the manna is compared above to hoar frost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-14.htm" title="And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, on the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.">Exodus 16:14</a>); here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-7.htm" title="And the manna was as coriander seed, and the color thereof as the color of bdellium.">Numbers 11:7</a>, to coriander seed. The former account describes its look as it lay on the ground, the latter its appearance after it was collected and brought in. The coriander seed is "a small round grain, of a whitish or yellowish grey." In Numbers it is further said that the colour was that of <span class= "ital">bdellium, </span>which is a whitish resin.<p><span class= "bld">The taste of it was like wafers made with honey.</span>--In Numbers the taste is compared to that of fresh oil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-8.htm" title="And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.">Numbers 11:8</a>). The wafers or cakes used by the Egyptians, Greeks, and other ancient nations as offerings, were ordinarily composed of fine wheaten flour, oil, and honey. According to a Jewish tradition which finds a place in the Book of Wisdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/16-20.htm" title="Notwithstanding they listened not to Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.">Exodus 16:20-21</a>), the taste of the manna varied according to the wish of the eater, and "tempered itself to every man's liking."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-36.</span> - THE APPEARANCE OF THE MANNA, ITS CONTINUANCE, AND ITS DEPOSITION IN THE TABERNACLE. - In bringing the subject of the manna to a conclusion, the writer adds a few words. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> On its appearance; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> On its deposition by divine command in the Ark of the Covenant; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> On its continuance during the forty years of the wanderings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is evident that verses 32-34 cannot have been written until after the sojourn in Sinai, and the command to make a tabernacle (ch. 26.): as also that verse 35 cannot have been written till the arrival of the Israelites at the verge of the land of Canaan. But there is nothing in the passage that militates against the Mosaic authorship of the whole. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The house of Israel</span>. This expression is unusual, and is not admitted by the Septuagint, the Syriac, or the Arabic versions, which all have "the children of Israel." Several Hebrew MSS. have bent, "sons," instead of beyth "house." <span class="cmt_word">Manna</span>. Literally, as in the Septuagint, man - the word used when they first beheld the substance (verse 15), and probably meaning "a gift.:' The elongated form manna, first appears in the Sept. rendering of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-6.htm">Numbers 11:6, 7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">It was like coriander seed</span>. This is "a small round grain of a whitish or yellowish grey." The comparison is made again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-7.htm">Numbers 11:7</a>, where it is added that the colour was that of bdellium - either the gum so called, or possibly the pearl. <span class="cmt_word">The taste of it was like wafers made with honey</span>. Such wafers or cakes were constantly used as offerings by the Egyptians, Greeks, and other nations. They were ordinarily compounded of meal, oil, and honey. Hence we can reconcile with the present passage the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-8.htm">Numbers 11:8</a>, that "the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:22-31 Here is mention of a seventh-day sabbath. It was known, not only before the giving of the law upon mount Sinai, but before the bringing of Israel out of Egypt, even from the beginning, Ge 2:3. The setting apart one day in seven for holy work, and, in order to that, for holy rest, was ever since God created man upon the earth, and is the most ancient of the Divine laws. Appointing them to rest on the seventh day, he took care that they should be no losers by it; and none ever will be losers by serving God. On that day they were to fetch in enough for two days, and to make it ready. This directs us to contrive family affairs, so that they may hinder us as little as possible in the work of the sabbath. Works of necessity are to be done on that day; but it is desirable to have as little as may be to do, that we may apply ourselves the more closely to prepare for the life that is to come. When they kept manna against a command, it stank; when they kept it by a command, it was sweet and good; every thing is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. On the seventh day God did not send the manna, therefore they must not expect it, nor go out to gather. This showed that it was produced by miracle.</body></html>
