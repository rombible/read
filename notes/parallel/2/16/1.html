"Sin" was reached exactly one month after the departure from Egypt, yet there had been only five camping-places between Sin and Rameses, and one journey of three days through a wilderness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-22.htm" title="So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.">Exodus 15:22</a>). Long rests are thus clearly indicated, and probably occurred at Ayun Musa, at Marah, and at Elim. The places named were the head-quarters of the camp on each occasion, but the entire host must have always covered a vast tract, and the flocks and herds must have been driven into all the neighbouring valleys where there was pasture. Wadys Useit, Ethal, and Tayibeh are likely to have been occupied at the same time with Wady Ghurundel.<span class= "bld"><p>All the congregation . . . came unto the</span> <span class= "bld">wilderness of Sin.</span>--"All the congregation" could only be united in certain favourable positions, where there happened to be a large open space. Such an open space is offered by the tract now called El Markha, which extends from north to south a distance of twenty miles, and is from three to four miles wide in its more northern half. To reach this tract, the Israelites must have descended by Wady Useit or Wady Tayibeh to the coast near Ras Abu Zenimeh, and have then continued along the coast until they crossed the twenty-ninth parallel. This line of march is indicated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/33-10.htm" title="And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea.">Numbers 33:10-11</a>, where we are told that "they removed from Elim, <span class= "ital">and encamped by the Red Sea; </span>and they removed from the Red Sea, and encamped in the wilderness of Sin."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - THE FIRST MURMURING FOR FOOD. From Elim, or the fertile tract extending from Wady Ghurnndel to Wady Tayibeh, the Israelites, after a time, removed, and ca-camped (as we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-10.htm">Numbers 33:10</a>) by the Red Sea, probably along the narrow coast tract extending from the mouth of Tayibeh to the entrance upon the broad plain of El Markha. Hence they entered upon "the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai" - a tract identified by some with the coast plain, El Markha, by others with the inland undulating region known at the present day as the Debbet-er-Ramleh It is difficult to decide between these two views. In favour of El Markha are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The fact that the Egyptian settlements in the Sinaitic peninsula would thus be avoided, as they seem to have been, since no contest with Egyptians is recorded; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The descent of the quails, who, wearied with a long flight over the Red Sea, would naturally settle as soon as they reached the shore; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The greater openness and facility of the El Markha and Wady Feiran route, which is admitted by all; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The suitability of the latter to the particulars of the narrative in ch. 18. In favour of the route by the Debbet-er-Ramleh are, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The fact that it is better watered at present than the other; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Its being somewhat less removed from the direct line between Wady Ghurundel and Sinai than El Markha; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> A certain correspondency of sound or meaning between some of the present geographical names along this route and those of the Mosaic narrative. In "the wilderness of Sin" the Israelites for the first time found themselves in want of sufficient nourishment. They hall consumed the grain which they had brought with them out of Egypt; and though no doubt they had still considerable flocks and herds, yet they were unaccustomed to a mere milk and flesh diet, having in Egypt lived principally upon bread (ver. 3), fish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-5.htm">Numbers 11:5</a>), and vegetables (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>). They therefore "murmured," and accused Moses and Aaron of an intention to starve them. It is quite possible that many of the poorer sorts having brought with them no cattle, or lost their cattle by the way, and not being helped by their brethren, were in actual danger of starvation. Hence God was not angry, but "heard their murmurings" (ver. 9) patiently, and relieved them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They journeyed from Elim, and all the congregation came</span>. It has been noted (Cook) that the form of expression seems to imply that the Israelites proceeded in detachments from Elim, and were first assembled as a complete host when they reached the wilderness of Sin." This accords well with their numbers and with the character of the localities. They could only assemble all together when they reached some considerable plain<span class="cmt_word">. Between Elim and Sinai</span>. This expression must be regarded as vague to some extent. On the direct line, as the crow flies, there is no "wilderness" (midbar) between Wady Ghurundel and Sinai. All is mountain and valley. All that the writer means is that "the wilderness of Sin" lay upon the ordinary, or at any rate an ordinary route between Elim and the great mountain. This is equally true of El Markha and the Debbet-er-Ramleh. <span class="cmt_word">On</span> <span class="cmt_word">the fifteenth day of the second month</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, on the 15th of Zif, exactly one month after their departure from Egypt. As only seven camping places are mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-5.htm">Numbers 33:5-11</a>), and one journey of three days through a wilderness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-22.htm">Exodus 15:22</a>), it is evident that there must either have been long stays in several places, or that they must have often encamped in places which had no name. Viewed as an itinerary, the record is manifestly incomplete. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-12 The provisions of Israel, brought from Egypt, were spent by the middle of the second month, and they murmured. It is no new thing for the greatest kindness to be basely represented as the greatest injuries. They so far undervalue their deliverance, that they wished they had died in Egypt; and by the hand of the Lord, that is, by the plagues which cut off the Egyptians. We cannot suppose they had plenty in Egypt, nor could they fear dying for want in the wilderness, while they had flocks and herds: none talk more absurdly than murmurers. When we begin to fret, we ought to consider, that God hears all our murmurings. God promises a speedy and constant supply. He tried whether they would trust him, and rest satisfied with the bread of the day in its day. Thus he tried if they would serve him, and it appeared how ungrateful they were. When God plagued the Egyptians, it was to make them know he was their Lord; when he provided for the Israelites, it was to make them know he was their God.</body></html>
