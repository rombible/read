But <span class= "ital">in the Hebrew there is no article </span>either here or in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-25.htm" title="And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath to the LORD: to day you shall not find it in the field.">Exodus 16:25</a>. The absence of the article indicates that it is a new thing which is announced--if not absolutely, at any rate to those to whom the announcement is made. Much, no doubt, may be said in favour of a primaeval institution of the Sabbath (see the comment on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/2-2.htm" title="And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.">Genesis 2:2-3</a>); and its observance in a certain sense by the Babylonians (see the first Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-5.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.">Exodus 16:5</a>) is in favour of its having been known to the family of Abraham; but during the Egyptian oppression the continued observance would have been impossible, and the surprise of the elders, as well as the words of Moses, show that at this time the idea was, to the Israelites, practically a novelty.<p><span class= "bld">Bake . . . Seethe</span>.--These directions imply a very different substance from any of the natural forms of manna. The heavenly "gift<span class= "ital">" </span>could be either made into a paste and baked, or converted into a porridge.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:22-31 Here is mention of a seventh-day sabbath. It was known, not only before the giving of the law upon mount Sinai, but before the bringing of Israel out of Egypt, even from the beginning, Ge 2:3. The setting apart one day in seven for holy work, and, in order to that, for holy rest, was ever since God created man upon the earth, and is the most ancient of the Divine laws. Appointing them to rest on the seventh day, he took care that they should be no losers by it; and none ever will be losers by serving God. On that day they were to fetch in enough for two days, and to make it ready. This directs us to contrive family affairs, so that they may hinder us as little as possible in the work of the sabbath. Works of necessity are to be done on that day; but it is desirable to have as little as may be to do, that we may apply ourselves the more closely to prepare for the life that is to come. When they kept manna against a command, it stank; when they kept it by a command, it was sweet and good; every thing is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. On the seventh day God did not send the manna, therefore they must not expect it, nor go out to gather. This showed that it was produced by miracle.</body></html>
