It is, in fact, this fifth pillar which, together with the use of the word '<span class= "ital">ohel, </span>gives to the tent theory of Mr. Fergusson, now generally adopted, its solid basis.<p><span class= "bld">Their hooks.</span>--The hooks from which the hanging was to be suspended.

The central pillar was, no doubt, as Mr. Fergusson long ago pointed out, one of two tent-poles, which supported between them a ridge-pole, over which were thrown the coverings that formed the roof of the tent. Its height was probably fifteen cubits, so as to give a due slope to the roof. The two pillars nearest to the central one probably measured ten cubits, and stood in line with the two walls of the <span class="accented">mishkan</span>. The outer pair would then have a height of five cubits, and support the two extremities of the goats' hair covering. <span class="cmt_word">Their hooks</span>. The hooks whereby the "hanging" was attached to the pillars. Compare ver. 32. <span class="cmt_word">Sockets of brass</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of bronze.

It was hung upon pillars. This vail was for a partition between the holy place and the most holy; which forbade any to look into the holiest of all. The apostle tells what was the meaning of this vail, Heb 9:8. That the ceremonial law could not make the comers thereunto perfect, nor would the observance of it bring men to heaven; the way into the holiest of all was not made manifest, while the first tabernacle was standing. Life and immortality lay hidden till they were brought to light by the gospel; which was signified by the rending of this vail at the death of Christ, Mt 27:51. We have now boldness to enter into the holiest, in all acts of worship, by the blood of Jesus; yet such as obliges us to holy reverence. Another vail was for the outer door of the tabernacle. This vail was all the defence the tabernacle had. God takes care of his church on earth. A curtain shall be, if God please to make it so, as strong a defence to his house, as gates of brass and bars of iron. With this typical description of Christ and his church before us, what is our judgment of these matters? Do we see any glory in the person of Christ? any excellence in his character? any thing precious in his salvation? or any wisdom in the doctrine of the cross? Will our religion bear examination? and are we more careful to approve our hearts to God than our characters toward men?</body></html>
