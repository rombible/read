THE WALLS OF THE TABERNACLE.</span><p>(15-30) The various coverings which have been described had it for their object to roof over and protect an oblong chamber or "dwelling," within which God was to manifest Himself and to be worshipped. The directions which follow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/26-15.htm" title="And you shall make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood standing up.">Exodus 26:15-33</a>) are for the construction of this chamber. It was to be enclosed by boards of shittim wood, fifteen feet high by two feet three inches wide, which were to be plated with gold, and made to stand upright by being inserted into solid sockets of silver. The two sides were to contain, each of them, twenty such boards, and thus to be forty-five feet long, while the connecting wall was to be composed of six such boards, together with two corner posts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-23.htm" title="And two boards shall you make for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.">Exodus 26:23</a>), giving it a length, probably, of ten cubits, or fifteen feet.<p>(15) <span class= "bld">Boards . . . of shittim wood.</span>--On the possibility of boards fifteen feet long by two feet three inches wide being cut from the <span class= "ital">Acacia seyal, </span>see the last Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-5.htm" title="And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,">Exodus 25:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Boards... of shittim</span> <span class="cmt_word">wood.</span> These boards were to be fifteen feet long by two feet three inches broad, and, if they were each of a single plank, can scarcely have been furnished by any of the acacias which now grow in the Sinaitic peninsula. It is possible, however, that they were made up of two or more planks, since the name by which they are designated, <span class="accented">kereth</span>, is thought to be applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-6.htm">Ezekiel 27:6</a>, to the "deck of a ship." <span class="cmt_word">Standing up</span>. The way in which they were to be made to "stand up" is explained in vers. 17 and 19. They were not to have one end sunk in the ground, but to be fitted by means of "tenons" into silver "sockets." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:15-30 The sockets of silver each weighed about 115 pounds; they were placed in rows on the ground. In every pair of these sockets, a strong board of shittim-wood, covered with plates of gold, was fitted by mortises and tenons. Thus walls were formed for the two sides, and for the west end. The wall was further held together by bars, which passed through rings of gold. Over this the curtains were spread. Though movable, it was strong and firm. The materials were very costly. In all this it was a type of the church of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief Corner-stone, Eph 2:20,21.</body></html>
