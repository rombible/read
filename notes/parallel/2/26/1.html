It is called <span class= "ital">ham-mishkan, "</span>the dwelling," and <span class= "ital">ha-'ohel, </span>"the tent" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-36.htm" title="And you shall make an hanging for the door of the tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, worked with needlework.">Exodus 26:36</a>)--the former from its purpose, as being the place where God "dwelt" in a peculiar manner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-22.htm" title="And there I will meet with you, and I will commune with you from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are on the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give you in commandment to the children of Israel.">Exodus 25:22</a>); the latter from its shape and general construction, which resembled those of other tents of the period. The necessary foundation was a framework of wood. This consisted of five "pillars," or tent-poles, in front (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-37.htm" title="And you shall make for the hanging five pillars of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, and their hooks shall be of gold: and you shall cast five sockets of brass for them.">Exodus 26:37</a>), graduated in height to suit the slope of the roof, and doubtless five similar ones at the back, though these are not mentioned. A ridge-pole must have connected the two central tent-poles, and over this ridge-pole the covering of the tent, which was of goats'-hair (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-7.htm" title="And you shall make curtains of goats' hair to be a covering on the tabernacle: eleven curtains shall you make.">Exodus 26:7</a>), was no doubt strained in the ordinary way by means of cords and "pins," or tent-pegs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-18.htm" title="The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords,">Exodus 35:18</a>). Thus an oblong square space was roofed over, which seems to have been sixty feet long by thirty broad. Within this "tent" ('<span class= "ital">ohel</span>) was placed the "dwelling" (<span class= "ital">mishkan</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>The "dwelling" was a space forty-five feet long by fifteen broad, enclosed on three sides by walls of boards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/26-18.htm" title="And you shall make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards on the south side southward.">Exodus 26:18-25</a>), and opening in front into a sort of porch formed by the projection of the "tent" beyond the "dwelling." Towards the open air this porch was closed, wholly or partially, by a curtain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-36.htm" title="And you shall make an hanging for the door of the tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, worked with needlework.">Exodus 26:36</a>). The "dwelling" was roofed over by another "curtain," or "hanging," of bright colours and rich materials (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/26-1.htm" title="Moreover you shall make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubim of cunning work shall you make them.">Exodus 26:1-6</a>). It was divided into two portions, called respectively "the Holy Place," and "the Holy of Holies"--the former towards the porch, the latter away from it. These two places were separated by a "vail" hung upon four pillars (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/26-31.htm" title="And you shall make a veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubim shall it be made:">Exodus 26:31-32</a>). Their relative size is uncertain; but it may be suspected that the Holy of Holies was the smaller of the two, and conjectured that the proportion was as one to two, the Holy of Holies being a square of fifteen feet, and the Holy Place an oblong, thirty feet long by fifteen. The whole structure was placed within an area called "the Court of the Tabernacle," which is described in the next chapter.<p><span class= "bld">1. THE FINE LINEN COVERING.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">The tabernacle.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the dwelling </span>(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-9.htm" title="According to all that I show you, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall you make it.">Exodus 25:9</a>, where <span class= "ital">mishkan </span>first occurs).

The inweaving of patterns or figures was well understood in Egypt (Herod, iii. 47; Plin. <span class= "ital">H. N., viii.</span> 48).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-37.</span> - THE TABERNACLE. The sacred furniture which the tabernacle was to contain having been described, with the exception of the "altar of incense" the description of which is reserved for ch 30. (vers. 1-10)-directions were next given for the sacred structure itself. This was to consist of three main things - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> A quadrangular enclosure thirty cubits long by ten broad, open at one end, and on the other three sides enclosed by boards of acacia-wood overlaid with gold - called the <span class="accented">mishkan</span>, or "the dwelling-place," in our version usually translated "tabernacle." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> A tent of goat's hair, supported upon poles, and stretched by means of ropes and tent-pegs in the ordinary manner over the <span class="accented">mishkan</span>. This is called the <span class="accented">ohel</span> - which is the usual word for a "tent" in Hebrew, and is so translated generally (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-20.htm">Genesis 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-21.htm">Genesis 9:21</a>; 13:31; 18:1, etc.), though in this chapter, unfortunately, "covering" (ver. 7); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> A "covering" - <span class="accented">mikseh</span>, to be placed over the <span class="accented">ohel</span>, composed of rams' skins dyed red, and seals' skins (ver. 14). Subordinate parts of the structure were - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> The sockets, or bases, which were to receive and support the upright boards (vers. 19-25); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> The bars which were to hold the boards together (vers. 26-29); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> The veil, stretched on pillars, which was to be hung across the" dwelling-house," and to separate it into two parts, the "holy place" and the "holy of holies" (vers. 31-33); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> The curtain or "hanging" at the open end of the "dwelling-place," where there were no boards, which was intended to close that side of the structure when necessary (vers. 36, 37). <span class="accented">The fine linen covering</span> (vers. 1-6). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains</span>. These "ten curtains" are explained in the verses which follow to be ten "breadths," so fastened together as to form practically a single curtain or awning, which constituted the cieling or inner covering of the tabernacle. The mode of its arrangement is not quite certain. Some suppose that it was really a part of the "tent," being laid over the same framework as the goats' hair curtain (Fergusson, Cook); others believe it to have been strained across the <span class="accented">mishkan</span> and fastened to the top of the boards on either side, thence depending, either inside or outside (Bahr, Keil). The former supposition appears the more probable. <span class="cmt_word">Fine twined linen</span> is linen the threads of which are formed of several fine strands twisted together. This is often the case with Egyptian linen. <span class="cmt_word">On blue and purple and scarlet</span>, see the comment upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-4.htm">Exodus 25:4</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Cherubims of cunning work</span>. Rather, "cherubim, the work of a skilled weaver." Figures of cherubs were to be woven into the hangings in the loom itself, not embroidered upon them afterwards. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:1-6 God manifested his presence among the Israelites in a tabernacle or tent, because of their condition in the wilderness. God suits the tokens of his favour, and the gifts of his grace, to his people's state and wants. The curtains of the tabernacle were to be very rich. They were to be embroidered with cherubim, signifying that the angels of God pitch their tents round about the church, Ps 34:7.</body></html>
