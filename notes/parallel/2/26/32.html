They were probably of equal height, and equally spaced, and were perhaps connected at the top by a cornice or beam. Together with the vail they formed a screen, which shut off the "Holy of Holies" from the outer chamber. They were, doubtless, of the same height as the boards, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>fifteen feet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-16.htm" title="Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and a cubit and a half shall be the breadth of one board.">Exodus 26:16</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Their hooks.</span>--Each pillar was to have a hook near the top, whereto the vail was to be attached.<p><span class= "bld">Upon the four sockets.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">upon four sockets.</span>--Each pillar was to have its "socket," into which it was to be inserted, and which was itself probably to be sunk into the ground.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Four pillars</span>. The contrast between these <span class="accented">four</span> pillars of the interior, and the "<span class="accented">five</span> pillars" at "the door of the tent" (vers. 36, 37), is striking, and justifies the supposition that the veil in the tabernacle did not completely divide the holy of holies from the holy place, but formed a screen, above which the space was open. If the veil had been hung from the top of the tented roof, so as completely to separate the two places, there must have been fire pillars, or at any rate an odd number, m the interior. <span class="cmt_word">Their hooks shall be of gold</span>. These are hooks attached to the pillars, for the purpose of their having the curtains hung upon them. <span class="cmt_word">Upon the four sockets</span>. The word "sockets" has no article. Translate - "Thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood overlaid with gold<span class="accented">, with their hooks of gold, and standing upon four sockets of silver</span>. The pillars probably had "tenons," like the boards (ver. 17), which were inserted into silver sockets, let into the ground. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:31-37 A vail, or curtain, separated the holy place from the most holy place. It was hung upon pillars. This vail was for a partition between the holy place and the most holy; which forbade any to look into the holiest of all. The apostle tells what was the meaning of this vail, Heb 9:8. That the ceremonial law could not make the comers thereunto perfect, nor would the observance of it bring men to heaven; the way into the holiest of all was not made manifest, while the first tabernacle was standing. Life and immortality lay hidden till they were brought to light by the gospel; which was signified by the rending of this vail at the death of Christ, Mt 27:51. We have now boldness to enter into the holiest, in all acts of worship, by the blood of Jesus; yet such as obliges us to holy reverence. Another vail was for the outer door of the tabernacle. This vail was all the defence the tabernacle had. God takes care of his church on earth. A curtain shall be, if God please to make it so, as strong a defence to his house, as gates of brass and bars of iron. With this typical description of Christ and his church before us, what is our judgment of these matters? Do we see any glory in the person of Christ? any excellence in his character? any thing precious in his salvation? or any wisdom in the doctrine of the cross? Will our religion bear examination? and are we more careful to approve our hearts to God than our characters toward men?</body></html>
