They were fifteen in number, five for each of the three sides of the boarded space. The "middle bar" on each side was to extend from end to end of the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-28.htm" title="And the middle bar in the middle of the boards shall reach from end to end.">Exodus 26:28</a>), the four bars above and below being shorter, each coupling together probably one-half of the boards of its side. The bars were passed through "rings" attached to the boards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-29.htm" title="And you shall overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings of gold for places for the bars: and you shall overlay the bars with gold.">Exodus 26:29</a>), each board having at least one such ring. It is probable that they were placed <span class= "ital">outside </span>the tabernacle walls.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26-28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bars of shittim wood</span>. To give greater stability to the structure, to keep the boards in their places, and to prevent there being any aperture between them, five bars were to be made for each side, and the same number for the end, of the <span class="accented">mishkan</span>, which were to be passed through rings attached to the boards - one at least to each - and thus to hold the boards firmly together. The middle bar in each case was to extend the whole length of the enclosure (ver. 28), and thus in two cases to be thirty cubits, or forty-five feet long. The exact length, and the disposition of the other bars is not indicated; but it is with reason conjectured that two were above and two below the "middle bar" that all were horizontal - and that each coupled together one half of the boards of each side. The length of each was probably fifteen cubits; and the ends which reached the two comer posts at the back ran into the corner rings, which were shaped so as to receive the two bars (see ver. 24). It is not said whether the bars were inside or outside the mishkan; but the best authorities suppose them to have been outside. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:15-30 The sockets of silver each weighed about 115 pounds; they were placed in rows on the ground. In every pair of these sockets, a strong board of shittim-wood, covered with plates of gold, was fitted by mortises and tenons. Thus walls were formed for the two sides, and for the west end. The wall was further held together by bars, which passed through rings of gold. Over this the curtains were spread. Though movable, it was strong and firm. The materials were very costly. In all this it was a type of the church of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief Corner-stone, Eph 2:20,21.</body></html>
