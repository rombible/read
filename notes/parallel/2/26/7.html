For this purpose an ordinary cloth of goats'-hair was requisite, and accordingly Moses was instructed to make a second covering, which was to be of this material, and to extend over the whole of the first, thus externally concealing it. This second covering was, like the first, to be in two portions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/26-9.htm" title="And you shall couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves, and shall double the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tabernacle.">Exodus 26:9-11</a>), each of them made up of several "breadths," but the two portions were not to be of the same size. Both were to be thirty cubits in length, but the hinder portion was to contain five "breadths," while the portion in front was to contain six. Thus the outer covering was six feet broader than the inner one. The object was the protection of the inner covering, which was overlapped at both ends by the outer one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-9.htm" title="And you shall couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves, and shall double the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tabernacle.">Exodus 26:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-12.htm" title="And the remnant that remains of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remains, shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle.">Exodus 26:12</a>).<p>(7) <span class= "bld">To be a covering.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">to be a tent. </span>(See the first Note on the chapter.)<p><span class= "bld">Eleven curtains</span>--i.e., eleven breadths.

Curtains of goats' hair, such as the Arabs still use, as the ordinary covering of their tents (Layard, <span class="accented">Nin. and Bab</span>., p. 171), were to form a true "tent" (<span class="accented">ohel</span>) above the tabernacle, being supported by tent-poles, and kept taut by means of cords and pegs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-19.htm">Exodus 27:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-18.htm">Exodus 35:18</a>). See the representation in Dr. W. Smith's <span class="accented">Dictionary of the Bible</span>, vol. 3. p. 1454, which is reproduced in the <span class="accented">Speaker's</span> <span class="accented">Commentary</span>, vol. 1. p. 376. <span class="cmt_word">To be a covering</span>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/36-14.htm">Exodus 36:14</a>, we have - "he made curtains of goats' hair <span class="accented">for the tent</span> over the tabernacle," which is far better. The word used in both places is the same (<span class="accented">ohel</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Eleven curtains</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "eleven <span class="accented">breadths</span>." Compare ver. 1. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:7-14 The curtains of meaner materials, being made both longer and broader, covered the others, and were defended by coverings of skins. The whole represents the person and doctrine of Christ, and the church of true Christians, and all heavenly things, which outwardly are mean, but inwardly, and in the sight of God, are glorious and precious.</body></html>
