THE HANGING FOR THE DOOR.</span><p>(36, 37) It is essential in the East to shut out light and heat, whence tents have always doors. These are usually made of a piece of cloth, which is raised for a man to enter, and falls behind him. But for a tent of the size described, which seems to have been above twenty-two feet high in the centre, something more was required. The "hanging" spoken of appears to have been a beautifully embroidered curtain, which could be either drawn up or let down, and which was attached by golden "hooks" to five pillars plated with gold, thus dividing the entrance into four equal spaces.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 36, 37.</span> - <span class="accented">The entrance to the tent</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt make a hanging</span>. A curtain which could draw up and. down, seems to be intended. When let down, it probably covered the entire eastern side, or front of the tabernacle. When raised, it allowed the eye to penetrate into the holy place. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:31-37 A vail, or curtain, separated the holy place from the most holy place. It was hung upon pillars. This vail was for a partition between the holy place and the most holy; which forbade any to look into the holiest of all. The apostle tells what was the meaning of this vail, Heb 9:8. That the ceremonial law could not make the comers thereunto perfect, nor would the observance of it bring men to heaven; the way into the holiest of all was not made manifest, while the first tabernacle was standing. Life and immortality lay hidden till they were brought to light by the gospel; which was signified by the rending of this vail at the death of Christ, Mt 27:51. We have now boldness to enter into the holiest, in all acts of worship, by the blood of Jesus; yet such as obliges us to holy reverence. Another vail was for the outer door of the tabernacle. This vail was all the defence the tabernacle had. God takes care of his church on earth. A curtain shall be, if God please to make it so, as strong a defence to his house, as gates of brass and bars of iron. With this typical description of Christ and his church before us, what is our judgment of these matters? Do we see any glory in the person of Christ? any excellence in his character? any thing precious in his salvation? or any wisdom in the doctrine of the cross? Will our religion bear examination? and are we more careful to approve our hearts to God than our characters toward men?</body></html>
