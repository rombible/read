Probably it has crept in from "the curtains" of the preceding verse. The meaning is that five "breadths" should be sewn together to form one curtain, and five other "breadths" to form another, and then that the two curtains so formed should be joined into one by means of "loops" and "taches." The object of making two curtains instead of one was clearly portability. The entire covering would have been too heavy and too bulky to be conveniently carried in one piece.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - When the ten "breadths" had been woven, five were to be sewn together to form one portion of the awning, and the other five to form another portion, the reason for this being, probably, that if all the ten breadths had been sewn together, the awning would have been too cumbrous to have been readily folded together, or easily conveyed when the people journeyed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:1-6 God manifested his presence among the Israelites in a tabernacle or tent, because of their condition in the wilderness. God suits the tokens of his favour, and the gifts of his grace, to his people's state and wants. The curtains of the tabernacle were to be very rich. They were to be embroidered with cherubim, signifying that the angels of God pitch their tents round about the church, Ps 34:7.</body></html>
