Their name marks them for descendants of Amalek, the grandson of Esau (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-12.htm" title="And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.">Genesis 36:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-16.htm" title="Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah.">Genesis 36:16</a>); and it would seem that they early became the predominant people in the Sinaitic peninsula. Balaam speaks of them as "the first of the nations" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-20.htm" title="And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.">Numbers 24:20</a>); and though we do lot meet with the name in the Egyptian records, yet it is probable that they were among the hostile nations whom we find constantly contending with the Egyptians upon their north-eastern frontier. Though Edomitesn they are always regarded as a distinct race, and one especially hostile to Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-16.htm" title="For he said, Because the LORD has sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.">Exodus 17:16</a>). Their present hostility was not altogether unprovoked. No doubt they regarded the Sinaitic region as their own, and as the most valuable portion of their territory, since it contained their summer and autumn pastures. During their absence in its more northern portion, where there was pasture for their flocks after the spring rains, a swarm of emigrants had occupied some of their best lands, and threatened to seize the remainder. Naturally, they would resent the occupation. They would not understand that it was only temporary. They would regard the Israelites as intruders, robbers, persons entitled to scant favour at their hands. Accordingly, they swooped upon them without mercy, attacked their rear as they were upon the march, cut off their stragglers, and slew many that were "feeble, faint, and weary" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/25-17.htm" title="Remember what Amalek did to you by the way, when you were come forth out of Egypt;">Deuteronomy 25:17-18</a>). They then encamped in their neighbourhood, with the design of renewing the struggle on the next day. It was under these circumstances that Moses had to make his arrangements.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-16.</span> - THE WAR WITH AMALEK. The Amalekites seem to have been descendants of Amalek, the grandson of Esau (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-12.htm">Genesis 36:12</a>). They separated themselves off from the other Edomites at an early date, and became the predominant tribe in the more northern parts of the Sinaitic peninsula, claiming and exercising a sovereignty over the whole of the desert country between the borders of Palestine and Egypt. We do not find the name Amalek in the Egyptian records; but the people are probably represented by the Mentu, with whom so many of the early Egyptian kings contended. The Pharaohs dispossessed them of the north-western portion of the mountain region; but they probably claimed the suzerainty of the central hills and valleys, which the Egyptians never occupied; and on these they no doubt set a high value as affording water and pasture for their flocks during the height of summer. When the Israelites pressed forward into these parts, the Amale-kites, in spite of the fact that they were a kindred race, determined on giving them battle. They began by "insidiously attacking the rear of the Hebrew army, when it was exhausted and weary" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-18.htm">Deuteronomy 25:18</a>). I-laving cut off many stragglers, they attacked the main body at Rephidim, in the Wady-Feiran, and fought the long battle which the text describes (vers. 10-13). The result was the complete discomfiture of the assailants, who thenceforth avoided all contact with Israel until attacked in their turn at the southern frontier of Canaan, when, in conjunction with the Canaanites, they were victorious (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>). A bitter and long continued enmity followed. Amalek, "the first of the nations" to attack Israel (Exodus 24:20), was pursued with unrelenting hostility (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a>), defeated repeatedly by Saul and David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-48.htm">1 Samuel 14:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-7.htm">1 Samuel 15:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-17.htm">1 Samuel 30:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-12.htm">2 Samuel 8:12</a>); the last remnant of the nation being finally destroyed by the Simeonites in the reign of king Hezekiah, as related by the author of Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-41.htm">1 Chronicles 4:41-43</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8</span>. - <span class="cmt_word">Then came Amalek</span>. The bulk of the Amalekites would have been passing <span class="cmt_word"><span class="accented">the</span></span> spring in the lower plains, where herbage is abundant after the early rains, while later in the year it dries up. They would hear of the threatened occupation of their precious summer pastures by the vast host of the Hebrews, and would seek to prevent it by blocking the way. Hence they are said to have "come" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to have marched into a position where they were not previously, though it was one situated within their country. We must remember that they were nomads. <span class="cmt_word">And fought with Israel</span> For the nature of the fighting on the first day, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-18.htm">Deuteronomy 25:18</a>; by which it appears that the original attack was made on the rear of the long column, and was successful. The Amalekites "smote the hindmost" of the Israelites, "even all that were feeble behind them, when they were faint and weary." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:8-16 Israel engaged with Amalek in their own necessary defence. God makes his people able, and calls them to various services for the good of his church. Joshua fights, Moses prays, both minister to Israel. The rod was held up, as the banner to encourage the soldiers. Also to God, by way of appeal to him. Moses was tired. The strongest arm will fail with being long held out; it is God only whose hand is stretched out still. We do not find that Joshua's hands were heavy in fighting, but Moses' hands were heavy in praying; the more spiritual any service is, the more apt we are to fail and flag in it. To convince Israel that the hand of Moses, whom they had been chiding, did more for their safety than their own hands, his rod than their sword, the success rises and falls as Moses lifts up or lets down his hands. The church's cause is more or less successful, as her friends are more or less strong in faith, and fervent in prayer. Moses, the man of God, is glad of help. We should not be shy, either of asking help from others, or of giving help to others. The hands of Moses being thus stayed, were steady till the going down of the sun. It was great encouragement to the people to see Joshua before them in the field of battle, and Moses above them on the hill. Christ is both to us; our Joshua, the Captain of our salvation, who fights our battles, and our Moses, who ever lives, making intercession above, that our faith fail not. Weapons formed against God's Israel cannot prosper long, and shall be broken at last. Moses must write what had been done, what Amalek had done against Israel; write their bitter hatred; write their cruel attempts; let them never be forgotten, nor what God had done for Israel in saving them from Amalek. Write what should be done; that in process of time Amalek should be totally ruined and rooted out. Amalek's destruction was typical of the destruction of all the enemies of Christ and his kingdom.</body></html>
