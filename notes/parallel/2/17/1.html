From El Markha there are three modes of reaching the Wady Feiran, where Rephidim is placed by most critics. One route (the shortest) is from the northern part of El Markha by Wady Shellal and Wady Magharah, where there was an important Egyptian settlement. This the Israelites would probably have avoided. Another, from the central part of El Markha, leads through the Wady Seih Sidreh to Magharah, and would, therefore, have been equally inconvenient. The third is circuitous, but has the advantage of being very open, and therefore suitable for a vast host. It passes through the whole of El Markha, and then, skirting the mountain, enters Wady Feiran at its south-western extremity. The probability seems on the whole to be that the Israelites pursued this last route.<p><span class= "bld">After their journeys.</span>--We find from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/33-12.htm" title="And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah.">Numbers 33:12-13</a>, that Rephidim was reached from the wilderness of Sin by three journeys--from Sin to Dophkah, from Dophkah to Alush, and from Alusb to Rephidim. The distance by the route which we have supposed the Israelites to have taken is about fifty miles.<p><span class= "bld">Rephidim </span>means <span class= "ital">rests, </span>or <span class= "ital">resting-places, </span>and is an appropriate name for the central part of the Wady Feiran--the most fertile spot in the whole peninsula, where there is usually abundant water, rich vegetation, and numerous palm-trees. (Lepsius, <span class= "ital">Tour from Thebes to Sinai, </span>pp. 21, 37; Stanley, <span class= "ital">Sinai and Palestine, </span>pp. 40, 41.) According to Dean Stanley, "the oldest known tradition of the peninsula" identifies Rephidim with Paran--the seat of an early bishopric--undoubtedly the same word with Feiran.<p><span class= "bld">There was no water.</span>--Though Feiran is usually watered by a copious stream, there have been occasions when the brook has been dried up. Graul found it dry in March, 1858. (Stanley, p. 40, Note 3.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - THE SECOND MUMURING FOR WATER. When the Israelites had come to Rephidim which was probably in the Wady Feiran, near its junction with the Wady Esh-Sheikh, complaint arose, not, as at Marah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-23.htm">Exodus 15:23</a>), that there was no drinkable water, but that there was no water at all. Water had been expected, and consequently no supply had been brought; but none was found. Violent murmurs arose, and the people were ready to stone their leader (ver. 4), who had, they considered, brought them into the difficulty. As usual, Moses took his grief to God, and laid it before him, with the result that God gave miraculous relief. Moses was bidden to take his rod, and go with the elders to a particular rock known as "the rock in Horeb" (ver. 6), and there strike the rock, and water would flow forth. This he did, and a copious stream welled out, which furnished abundant drink to the whole multitude. In remembrance of the murmuring, he called the place Massah (trial) and Meribah (quarrel). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From the wilderness of Sin</span>. See the comment on Exodus 16:1. The sandy coast tract (El Murka) was probably quitted in lat. 28&deg; 42' nearly, and the Wady Feiran entered on at its south-western extremity. Two stations, Dophkah and Alush, lay between the Sin wilderness and Rephidim, as we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-12.htm">Numbers 33:12, 13</a>. It is impossible to locate these places with exactness. <span class="cmt_word">After their journeys</span>. The three stages - from Sin to Dophkah, from Dophkah to Alush, and from Alush to Rephidim - seem to be alluded to. <span class="cmt_word">According to the commandment of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Lord.</span> Literally, "at the mouth of Jehovah," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as God ordered them. The command was signified by the movement of the "pillar of the cloud." <span class="cmt_word">And pitched in Rephidim</span>. The word Rephidim signifies "resting places," and "is the natural name for the paradise of the Bedouins in the palm-grove where the church and palace of the bishops of Paran formerly stood "(Stanley, Sinai and Palestine, p. 41). <span class="cmt_word">There was no water</span>. The Wady Feiran is watered ordinarily by a copious stream; but at times the brook is dry (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> p. 40, note 3). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-7 The children of Israel journeyed according to the commandment of the Lord, led by the pillar of cloud and fire, yet they came to a place where there was no water for them to drink. We may be in the way of duty, yet may meet with troubles, which Providence brings us into, for the trial of our faith, and that God may be glorified in our relief. They began to question whether God was with them or not. This is called their tempting God, which signifies distrust of him after they had received such proofs of his power and goodness. Moses mildly answered them. It is folly to answer passion with passion; that makes bad worse. God graciously appeared to help them. How wonderful the patience and forbearance of God toward provoking sinners! That he might show his power as well as his pity, and make it a miracle of mercy, he gave them water out of a rock. God can open fountains for us where we least expect them. Those who, in this wilderness, keep to God's way, may trust him to provide for them. Also, let this direct us to depend on Christ's grace. The apostle says, that Rock was Christ, 1Co 10:4, it was a type of him. While the curse of God might justly have been executed upon our guilty souls, behold the Son of God is smitten for us. Let us ask and receive. There was a constant, abundant supply of this water. Numerous as believers are, the supply of the Spirit of Christ is enough for all. The water flowed from the rock in streams to refresh the wilderness, and attended them on their way towards Canaan; and this water flows from Christ, through the ordinances, in the barren wilderness of this world, to refresh our souls, until we come to glory. A new name was given to the place, in remembrance, not of the mercy of their supply, but of the sin of their murmuring: Massah, Temptation, because they tempted God; Meribah, Strife, because they chid with Moses. Sin leaves a blot upon the name.</body></html>
