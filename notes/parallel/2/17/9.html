He was an Ephraimite, the son of a man called Nun, and the tenth in descent from Joseph (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-16.htm" title="And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.">Exodus 6:16</a>), in the prime of life--about 45 years old--and probably known as possessing military capacity. His actual name at the timo was Hoshea, which might have been viewed as a good omen, since the word meant "Saviour." Moses afterwards changed his name to Jehoshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-16.htm" title="These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.">Numbers 13:16</a>), which became by contraction Joshua. We find him, later in Exodus, acting as Moses' personal attendant, or "minister" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-13.htm" title="If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either good or bad of my own mind; but what the LORD said, that will I speak?">Numbers 24:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-17.htm" title="But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.">Numbers 32:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-11.htm" title="And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in the wilderness of Sin.">Numbers 33:11</a>), accompanying him to the top of Sinai, and placed by him in charge of the first "Tabernacle." Afterwards he, with Caleb, was the only one of the spies who brought back a true report of Canaan. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/14-6.htm" title="And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:">Numbers 14:6-9</a>.) His choice as leader to succeed Moses resulted naturally from his antecedents, and is related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/27-18.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Take you Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay your hand on him;">Numbers 27:18-23</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Choose us out men.</span>--The weakness of Israel was in its unwieldy numbers. Moses saw this, and, after deciding that he was himself unfit for battle, and passing the command on to Joshua, made the one suggestion that a select body of troops should be employed against the assailants. The advice was good, and "Joshua did as Moses had said to him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-10.htm" title="So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.">Exodus 17:10</a>).<p><span class= "bld">I will stand on the top of the hill.</span>--A particular "hill" was no doubt meant--a "hill," and not a mountain. But the <span class= "ital">exact </span>scene of the battle is too uncertain to make it possible to fix on any one particular eminence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Moses said</span> <span class="cmt_word">to Joshua.</span> On hearing what had happened, Moses summoned to his presence an Ephraimite in the prime of life - about 45 years old - and devolved on him the military command. The man's name at the time was Hoshea or Oshea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-8.htm">Numbers 13:8</a>). He was the son of a certain Nun (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>) or Non (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-27.htm">1 Chronicles 7:27</a>), and the tenth in descent from Ephraim, the son of Joseph (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 23-27). Some forty years later Moses changed his name from Hoshea to Jehoshua. which became contracted into Joshua. The occurrence of this form in the present passage may be accounted for. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> By Moses having written (or reviewed) Exodus late in his life; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> By a later authorised reviser (Ezra?) having altered the text. <span class="cmt_word">Choose out for us men</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Select from the congregation such a number of fit men as appear to thee sufficient, and with them fight Amalek." To-morrow. It was probably evening, when Moses heard of the attack on his rear, and there was consequently no possibility of retrieving the disaster till the next day. lie could but make his arrangements for retrieving it. <span class="cmt_word">I will stand on the top of the hill</span>. It is implied that there was a conspicuous hill (gibeah), not a rock (tsur) in the near vicinity of Rephidim, whence Moses could see the fight, and be seen by those engaged in it. Dean Stanley finds all the conditions answered by an eminence on the south side of the Wady Feiran (Sinai and Palestine, p. 41). Others suggest the Jebel Tahuneh north of the same wady. <span class="cmt_word">With the rod of God in my hand.</span> Moses meant to indicate by this, that he looked for victory to God alone, and did not trust in an "arm of flesh," while, nevertheless, he sent his soldiers to the combat. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:8-16 Israel engaged with Amalek in their own necessary defence. God makes his people able, and calls them to various services for the good of his church. Joshua fights, Moses prays, both minister to Israel. The rod was held up, as the banner to encourage the soldiers. Also to God, by way of appeal to him. Moses was tired. The strongest arm will fail with being long held out; it is God only whose hand is stretched out still. We do not find that Joshua's hands were heavy in fighting, but Moses' hands were heavy in praying; the more spiritual any service is, the more apt we are to fail and flag in it. To convince Israel that the hand of Moses, whom they had been chiding, did more for their safety than their own hands, his rod than their sword, the success rises and falls as Moses lifts up or lets down his hands. The church's cause is more or less successful, as her friends are more or less strong in faith, and fervent in prayer. Moses, the man of God, is glad of help. We should not be shy, either of asking help from others, or of giving help to others. The hands of Moses being thus stayed, were steady till the going down of the sun. It was great encouragement to the people to see Joshua before them in the field of battle, and Moses above them on the hill. Christ is both to us; our Joshua, the Captain of our salvation, who fights our battles, and our Moses, who ever lives, making intercession above, that our faith fail not. Weapons formed against God's Israel cannot prosper long, and shall be broken at last. Moses must write what had been done, what Amalek had done against Israel; write their bitter hatred; write their cruel attempts; let them never be forgotten, nor what God had done for Israel in saving them from Amalek. Write what should be done; that in process of time Amalek should be totally ruined and rooted out. Amalek's destruction was typical of the destruction of all the enemies of Christ and his kingdom.</body></html>
