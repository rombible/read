Such a supply as the people may have brought with them from Elim would have been exhausted. They would have looked forward to Rephidim both for their immediate necessity and for replenishing their water-skins. They would be suffering both from thirst and disappointment. The needs of their children and their cattle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-3.htm" title="And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Why is this that you have brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?">Exodus 17:3</a>) would be an aggravation of their pain. They would see no hope in the future. Under the circumstances we cannot be surprised at their "chiding." Nothing but a very lively faith, or an utter resignation to the will of God, could have made a people patient and submissive in such an extremity.<p><span class= "bld">Give us water.</span>--It was not faith that spoke in these words, but wrath. They had no belief that Moses could give them water, and <span class= "ital">"</span>were almost ready to stone" him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-4.htm" title="And Moses cried to the LORD, saying, What shall I do to this people? they be almost ready to stone me.">Exodus 17:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people did chide.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.<span class="cmt_word"></span></span> "quarrelled," made open murmurs and complaint - as before frequently (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-11.htm">Exodus 14:11, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-24.htm">Exodus 15:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2, 3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Give us</span> <span class="cmt_word">water</span>. As Moses had already given them flesh (the quails) and bread (the manna), so it perhaps seemed to the people easy that he should give them such a common thing as water. Stanley notices (p. 70) that the wadys suggest the idea of water, and make its absence the more intolerable - they are "exactly like rivers," with "torrent bed, and banks, and clefts in the rock for tributary streams, and at times even rushes and shrubs fringing their course" - signs of "water, water everywhere, yet not a drop to drink." <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore do ye tempt the Lord</span>? To "tempt the Lord" is to try his patience by want of faith, to arouse his anger, to provoke him to punish us. It was the special sin of the Israelites during the whole period of their sojourn in the wilderness. They "tempted and provoked the most high God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-56.htm">Psalm 78:56</a>); "provoked him to anger with their inventions" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-29.htm">Psalm 106:29</a>), "murmured in their tents" (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 25), "provoked him at the sea" (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 7), "tempted him in the desert" (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 14). God's long-suffering, notwithstanding all, is simply amazing! <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-7 The children of Israel journeyed according to the commandment of the Lord, led by the pillar of cloud and fire, yet they came to a place where there was no water for them to drink. We may be in the way of duty, yet may meet with troubles, which Providence brings us into, for the trial of our faith, and that God may be glorified in our relief. They began to question whether God was with them or not. This is called their tempting God, which signifies distrust of him after they had received such proofs of his power and goodness. Moses mildly answered them. It is folly to answer passion with passion; that makes bad worse. God graciously appeared to help them. How wonderful the patience and forbearance of God toward provoking sinners! That he might show his power as well as his pity, and make it a miracle of mercy, he gave them water out of a rock. God can open fountains for us where we least expect them. Those who, in this wilderness, keep to God's way, may trust him to provide for them. Also, let this direct us to depend on Christ's grace. The apostle says, that Rock was Christ, 1Co 10:4, it was a type of him. While the curse of God might justly have been executed upon our guilty souls, behold the Son of God is smitten for us. Let us ask and receive. There was a constant, abundant supply of this water. Numerous as believers are, the supply of the Spirit of Christ is enough for all. The water flowed from the rock in streams to refresh the wilderness, and attended them on their way towards Canaan; and this water flows from Christ, through the ordinances, in the barren wilderness of this world, to refresh our souls, until we come to glory. A new name was given to the place, in remembrance, not of the mercy of their supply, but of the sin of their murmuring: Massah, Temptation, because they tempted God; Meribah, Strife, because they chid with Moses. Sin leaves a blot upon the name.</body></html>
