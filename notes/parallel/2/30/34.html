Incense, as commonly used in the ancient world, was not a composition, but some single spice, most frequently frankincense. That, however, employed by the Hebrews was always a compound. According to Josephus (<span class= "ital">Bell. Jud., </span>v. 5, ? 5), the incense burnt in the later temple contained thirteen ingredients.<p><span class= "bld">Stacte </span>is probably the gum storax, which is the produce of the <span class= "ital">styrax officinalis, </span>a tree common in Syria and Palestine. It burns readily, and emits much smoke (Herod. iii. 107).<p><span class= "bld">Onycha </span>is thought to be the "claw" or <span class= "ital">operculum </span>of the <span class= "ital">unguis odoratus, </span>or <span class= "ital">blatta Byzantina, </span>a sort of shell-fish common in the Red Sea. This "claw" produces, when burnt, a strong odour.<p><span class= "bld">Galbanum </span>is a gum well known to modern chemists. It may be procured from various plants, as the <span class= "ital">opoidia galbanifera, </span>the <span class= "ital">galbanum Persicum, </span>and others. When burnt, this gum has a strong pungent odour, which is said to be disagreeable in itself, but to bring out and prolong the scent of other spices (Plin. <span class= "ital">H. N., xii.</span> 54).<p><span class= "bld">Frankincense </span>was probably the main element of the "holy incense," as it is of such incense as is burnt in modern times. It is a gum or resin obtained from incisions in the bark of the <span class= "ital">arbor thuris, </span>or frankincense-tree, which grows abundantly in India, and in the islands of the Indian archipelago. Anciently, the tree appears to have grown also in Arabia, whence the Egyptians (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>vol. x., pp. 14-17), the Ph?nicians, the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-6.htm" title="The multitude of camels shall cover you, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises of the LORD.">Isaiah 60:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-20.htm" title="To what purpose comes there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet to me.">Jeremiah 6:20</a>), and the Greeks obtained it in large quantities. The odour is very peculiar, and to most persons very agreeable. In England it is best known as the scent given out by the pastilles which are burnt in sick rooms.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 34-38.</span> - THE HOLY INCENSE. It remained to give directions concerning the composition of the incense, which, according to verse 7, was to be burnt upon the altar of gold. That it was to be of one and one only peculiar kind had been already implied in the prohibition to burn "strange incense" (ver. 9). Moses is now told exactly how it was to be composed. As the oil was to contain four spices, so was the incense to be made of a like number - stacte, onycha, galbanum, and frankincense - of each the same quantity (ver. 34). The art of the apothecary was to be called in for making it up (ver. 35). A portion of it was to be "beaten very small," and placed in front of the ark of the covenant, probably on the golden altar outside the vail (ver. 36). A prohibition is added, similar to that given with respect to the holy oil: no one is to make any like it for private use, under pain of being "cut off from his people" (vers. 37, 38). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take unto thee sweet spices.</span> Rather, "Take unto thee spices," or "perfumes." The word has no epithet. <span class="cmt_word">Stacte.</span> The Hebrew word used means simply "a drop" (Job 32:27), and might be applied to any gum or resin which exuded from a tree. We have no clue to the gum here intended but that which is furnished by the rendering of the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;</span>, which our translators have followed. Now the Greeks seem to have called two gums by this name - one, the natural exudation from the myrrh tree, called above (ver. 23) "pure myrrh," or "the myrrh that flows freely;" and the other gum storax. As it is not likely that the same substance has been given two names within the space of ten verses, we must suppose the latter to be meant. Gum storax is the produce of a tree allied to the poplar, and known as <span class="accented">Styrax officinalis</span>, which grows abundantly in Syria and Palestine. It was frequently used as a perfume by the ancients (Herod. 3:107; Plin. <span class="accented">H</span>. <span class="accented">N</span>. 12:17, &sect;40). <span class="cmt_word">Onycha</span>. The Hebrew word, <span class="accented">she-kheleth</span>, seems to mean a "shell" of some kind or other. The Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3be;</span>, Lat. onycha, was applied to the <span class="accented">operculum</span> - the "nail" or "claw" - of certain shell-fish of the genus Strombidae, which were common in the lied Sea, and elsewhere. The particular <span class="accented">strombus</span> which furnishes the onycha of the ancients is thought to have been the <span class="accented">Unguis odoratus</span> or <span class="accented">Blatta Byzantina</span>. The <span class="accented">opercula</span> of these shell-fish have, when burnt, a strong odour, "something like castoreum." The onycha is, again coupled with galbanum and gum storax in Ecclesiates 24:15. Galbanum. The Hebrew word <span class="accented">khelb'nah</span>, is so near the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;</span> and the Latin <span class="accented">galbanum</span> that it has with good reason been assumed to designate the same substance. Galbanum is a gum well known both to ancients and moderns. It is admitted into the pharmacopeia. Several plants seem to produce it, as the <span class="accented">Opoidia galbanifera</span>, the <span class="accented">Galbanum Persicum</span>, and a plant which grows in Northern Persia, very like the Ferula erubeseens. When burnt, <span class="accented">galbanum</span> has a strong pungent odour, which is said to be disagreeable by itself, but to improve and preserve other odours (Plin. <span class="accented">H</span>. <span class="accented">N</span>. 12:54). <span class="cmt_word">Frankincense</span>. On the wide use of frankincense, see the comment on ver. 1. It was the produce of a tree which anciently flourished in Arabia, but which appears to have degenerated, and now produces only an inferior quality. The best frankincense comes now from the high lands of India. It exudes from a tree called salai (the <span class="accented">Boswellia setrata</span> or <span class="accented">thurifera</span> of botanists). Some think that the frankincense exported largely from Arabia to the neighbouring nations was in part the produce of this tree imported by the Arab merchants from Hindustan. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:22-38 Directions are here given for making the holy anointing oil, and the incense to be used in the service of the tabernacle. To show the excellency of holiness, there was this spiced oil in the tabernacle, which was grateful to the sight and to the smell. Christ's name is as ointment poured forth, So 1:3, and the good name of Christians is like precious ointment, Ec 7:1. The incense burned upon the golden altar was prepared of sweet spices. When it was used, it was to be beaten very small; thus it pleased the Lord to bruise the Redeemer, when he offered himself for a sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savour. The like should not be made for any common use. Thus God would keep in the people's minds reverence for his own services, and teach us not to profane or abuse any thing whereby God makes himself known. It is a great affront to God to jest with sacred things, and to make sport with his word and ordinances. It is most dangerous and fatal to use professions of the gospel of Christ to forward wordly interests.</body></html>
