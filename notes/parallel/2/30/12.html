Hitherto, nothing but a rough estimate of the number had been attempted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-37.htm" title="And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.">Exodus 12:37</a>); now that a covenant had been made with God, an exact account of those who were within the covenant was needed. Moses, apparently, was contemplating such an exact enumeration when the command contained in this text was given him. It would be natural for one trained in Egyptian habits to desire such exact statistical knowledge. (For the minuteness and fulness of the Egyptian statistics of the time, see <span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>vol. ii., pp. 19-28; vol. iv. pp. 46, 47; vol. vi. pp. 35-69, &c.)<p><span class= "bld">Then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul.</span>--On being formally enrolled among the people of God, it would be brought home to every man how unworthy he was of such favour, how necessary it was that atonement should in some way or other be made for him. God therefore appointed a way--the same way for all--in order to teach strongly that all souls were of equal value in His sight, and that unworthiness, whatever its degree, required the same expiation.<p><span class= "bld">That there be no plague among them.</span>--If a man did not feel his need of "ransom," and gladly pay the small sum at which the ransom was fixed, he would show himself so proud and presumptuous that he might well provoke a Divine "plague," or punishment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When thou takest the sum</span>. The sum had been taken roughly at the time of the exodus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>). Moses was now, it would seem, about to take it again, more accurately. No command had ever been given that the people should not be numbered; and the Egyptian habit of compiling exact statistics naturally clung to one who had had an Egyptian training. (See the "Statistical Tables of Karnak," in the "<span class="accented">Records of the Past</span>," vol. 2. pp. 19-28.) <span class="cmt_word">A ransom</span>. Rather "an expiation," "an atonement" - (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-33.htm">Exodus 29:33, 36</a>) - something to show that he was conscious of sin, and of his not deserving to be numbered among God's people. That there was no plague. "That they be not punished for undue pride and presumption. There is no thought of such a plague as was provoked by David's numbering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-15.htm">2 Samuel 24:15</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:11-16 The tribute was half a shekel, about fifteen pence of our money. The rich were not to give more, nor the poor less; the souls of the rich and poor are alike precious, and God is no respecter of persons, Ac 10:34; Job 34:19. In other offerings men were to give according to their wordly ability; but this, which was the ransom of the soul, must be alike for all. The souls of all are of equal value, equally in danger, and all equally need a ransom. The money raised was to be used in the service of the tabernacle. Those who have the benefit, must not grudge the necessary charges of God's public worship. Money cannot make atonement for the soul, but it may be used for the honour of Him who has made the atonement, and for the maintenance of the gospel by which the atonement is applied.</body></html>
