Of our money. Their average weight was about 220 grains troy. In Moses's time coins were unknown, and a half-shekel was a small lump of silver, unstamped, weighing probably about 110 grains. The ransom of a soul was doubtless made thus light in order that the payment might not be felt practically as a burthen by any.<p><span class= "bld">After the shekel of the sanctuary.</span>--Without a standard laid up somewhere, weights and measures will always fluctuate largely. Even with a standard, they will practically vary considerably. The "shekel of the sanctuary" probably designates a standard weight kept carefully by the priests with the vessels of the sanctuary. All offerings were to be estimated by this shekel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-25.htm" title="And all your estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.">Leviticus 27:25</a>).<p><span class= "bld">A shekel is twenty gerahs.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the shekel, i.e.; </span>the shekel of the sanctuary is of this weight. A "gerah" was, literally, <span class= "ital">a bean, </span>probably the bean of the carob or locust tree (C<span class= "ital">eratonia siliqua</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>but became the name of a weight, just as our own "grain" did. It must have equalled about eleven grains troy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Half a shekel</span>. The shekel of later times was a silver coin, about the size round of our shilling, but considerably thicker, and worth about one shilling and eightpence. But at the date of the exodus coins were unknown, and the "shekel" meant a certain weight. The burthen imposed by the tax was evidently a light one. <span class="cmt_word">The shekel of the sanctuary</span>. A standard weight in the possession of the priests, equal probably to about 220 grains troy. <span class="cmt_word">Twenty gerahs</span>. The word "gerah" means "a bean;" and the <span class="accented">gerah</span> must bare been a weight equal to about eleven grains troy, It remained in use to the time of the captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-12.htm">Ezekiel 45:12</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:11-16 The tribute was half a shekel, about fifteen pence of our money. The rich were not to give more, nor the poor less; the souls of the rich and poor are alike precious, and God is no respecter of persons, Ac 10:34; Job 34:19. In other offerings men were to give according to their wordly ability; but this, which was the ransom of the soul, must be alike for all. The souls of all are of equal value, equally in danger, and all equally need a ransom. The money raised was to be used in the service of the tabernacle. Those who have the benefit, must not grudge the necessary charges of God's public worship. Money cannot make atonement for the soul, but it may be used for the honour of Him who has made the atonement, and for the maintenance of the gospel by which the atonement is applied.</body></html>
