In the tabernacle itself, the consecration was to begin with the ark of the testimony in the Holy of Holies, then to proceed to the Holy place, where the table of shewbread with its "vessels," the golden candlestick, and the altar of incense were to be anointed; and finally to pass the vail to the outer court, where the holy oil was to be sprinkled upon the brazen altar, and upon the laver, to sanctify them. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/30-26.htm" title="And you shall anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony,">Exodus 30:26-29</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/8-10.htm" title="And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.">Leviticus 8:10-11</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26-29</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt anoint the tabernacle</span>. The first application of the holy oil was to be to the inanimate objects constituting the paraphernalia of worship - viz., <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The tabernacle itself as a whole; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The furniture of the holy of holies - the ark and mercy seat; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The furniture of the holy place - the show-bread table, the candlestick, and the altar of incense; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The furniture of the court - the altar of burnt-offering, and the laver. After applying the oil to these, Moses was to proceed to the anointing of the priests. (Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10-12</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:22-38 Directions are here given for making the holy anointing oil, and the incense to be used in the service of the tabernacle. To show the excellency of holiness, there was this spiced oil in the tabernacle, which was grateful to the sight and to the smell. Christ's name is as ointment poured forth, So 1:3, and the good name of Christians is like precious ointment, Ec 7:1. The incense burned upon the golden altar was prepared of sweet spices. When it was used, it was to be beaten very small; thus it pleased the Lord to bruise the Redeemer, when he offered himself for a sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savour. The like should not be made for any common use. Thus God would keep in the people's minds reverence for his own services, and teach us not to profane or abuse any thing whereby God makes himself known. It is a great affront to God to jest with sacred things, and to make sport with his word and ordinances. It is most dangerous and fatal to use professions of the gospel of Christ to forward wordly interests.</body></html>
