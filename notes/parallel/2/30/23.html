but of these some few have always been regarded with especial favour. Herodotus (iii. 107-112) mentions five "principal spices" as furnished by Arabia to other countries, whereof two at least appear to be identical with those here spoken of.<p><span class= "bld">Pure myrrh.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">myrrh of freedom. </span>The shrub which produces myrrh is the <span class= "ital">balsamodendron myrrha. </span>The spice is obtained from it in two ways. That which is purest and best exudes from it naturally (Theophrast. <span class= "ital">De Odoribus, </span>? 29; Plin., <span class= "ital">H. N., xii.</span> 35), and is here called "myrrh of freedom," or "freely flowing myrrh." The other and inferior form is obtained from incisions made in the bark. Myrrh was very largely used in ancient times. The Egyptians employed it as a main element in their best method of embalming (Herod. ii. 86), and also burnt it in some of their sacrifices (<span class= "ital">ib. </span>40). In Persia it was highly esteemed as an odour (Athen., <span class= "ital">Deipn. 12</span>, p. 514A); the Greeks used it in unguents. And as incense; Roman courtesans scented their hair with it (Hor. <span class= "ital">Od., </span>iii. 14, 1. 22); the later Jews applied it as an antiseptic to corpses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-39.htm" title="And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.">John 19:39</a>). This is the first mention of myrrh (Heb., <span class= "ital">mor</span>) in the Bible, the word translated "myrrh" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-25.htm" title="And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.">Genesis 37:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-11.htm" title="And their father Israel said to them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:">Genesis 43:11</a> being <span class= "ital">lot, </span>which is properly, not myrrh, but ladanum.<p><span class= "bld">Sweet cinnamon.</span>--While myrrh was one of the commonest of spices in the ancient world, cinnamon was one of the rarest. It is the produce of the <span class= "ital">laurus cinnamomum, </span>or <span class= "ital">cinnamomum zeylanicum, </span>a tree allied to the laurel, which now grows only in Ceylon, Borneo, Sumatra, China, Cochin China, and in India on the coast of Malabar. According to Herodotus (iii. 111) and Strabo (16, p. 535), it grew anciently in Arabia; but this is doubted, and the Arabians are believed to have imported it from India or Ceylon, and passed it on to the Ph?nicians, who conveyed it to Egypt and Greece. The present passage of Scripture is the first in which it is mentioned, and in the rest of the Old Testament it obtains notice only twice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-16.htm" title="I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.">Proverbs 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-14.htm" title="Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:">Song of Solomon 4:14</a>). The word used, which is <span class= "ital">kinn?mon, </span>makes it tolerably certain that the true cinnamon is meant.<p><span class= "bld">Sweet calamus.</span>--There are several distinct kinds of aromatic reed in the East. One sort, according to Pliny (H. N., xii. 22), grew in Syria, near Mount Lebanon; others were found in India and Arabia. It is quite uncertain what particular species is intended, either here or in the other passages of Scripture where "sweet cane" is spoken of. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-14.htm" title="Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:">Song of Solomon 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-24.htm" title="You have bought me no sweet cane with money, neither have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices: but you have made me to serve with your sins, you have wearied me with your iniquities.">Isaiah 43:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-20.htm" title="To what purpose comes there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet to me.">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-17.htm" title="Judah, and the land of Israel, they were your merchants: they traded in your market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.">Ezekiel 27:17</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Principal</span> <span class="cmt_word">spices.</span> The ancients recognised a vast variety of spices. Pliny notices an ointment which was composed of twenty-six ingredients, chiefly spices (H.N. 13:2, &sect; 18). Herodotus mentions five "principal spices" as furnished by Arabia (3:107), of which four seem to be identical with those employed in the holy oil. <span class="cmt_word">Pure myrrh</span>. Literally, "myrrh of freedom," or "freely flowing myrrh." The shrub which yields myrrh (<span class="accented">Balsamodendron myrrha</span>) produces two kinds - one, which exudes spontaneously, and is regarded as the best (Plin. II. 4:12:35; Theophrast. <span class="accented">De Odoribus</span>, &sect; 29); and another, of inferior quality, which flows from incisions made in the bark. It is the former kind which is here intended. Myrrh was among the ancients in high request as a spice. It was used by the Egyptians for embalming (Herod 2:86), in Persia as an odour (Athen. <span class="accented">Deipn</span>, 12. p. 514, A); by the Greeks for incense (Soph. Fr. 340) and in unguents (Aristoph <span class="accented">Eq</span> 1. 1332); by the later Jews in funerals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39</a>); and was largely exported from Arabia and Ethiopia into various parts of Asia and Europe. <span class="cmt_word">Sweet</span> <span class="cmt_word">cinnamon</span>. Cinnamon was a far rarer spice than myrrh. It is only mentioned three times in the Old Testament (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-16.htm">Proverbs 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-14.htm">Song of Solomon 4:14</a>). I am not aware of any trace of it in Egypt; but Herodotus says that it was obtained by the Greeks from Arabia in his day (3:111). It is the inner bark or rind of a tree allied to the laurel, and called by some <span class="accented">Laurus cinnamomum</span>, by others <span class="accented">Cinnamomum zeylanicum</span>. The tree now grows only in India on the Malabar coast, in Ceylon, Borneo, Sumatra, Cochin China, and China. If its habitat has not suffered contraction, we must regard the mention of it here as indicative of a very early commerce of a very extensive character. <span class="cmt_word">Sweet</span> <span class="cmt_word">calamus</span>. Aromatic reeds, probably of several distinct kind, seem to have been the produce anciently of Palestine, Arabia, Mesopotamia, and India. It is impossible to say what exactly was the species here intended. Calamus is mentioned as a spice in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-24.htm">Isaiah 43:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-17.htm">Ezekiel 27:17</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-14.htm">Song of Solomon 4:14</a>; but the term used (kaneh, "cane ") is vague; and it is not at all clear that one species only is alluded to. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:22-38 Directions are here given for making the holy anointing oil, and the incense to be used in the service of the tabernacle. To show the excellency of holiness, there was this spiced oil in the tabernacle, which was grateful to the sight and to the smell. Christ's name is as ointment poured forth, So 1:3, and the good name of Christians is like precious ointment, Ec 7:1. The incense burned upon the golden altar was prepared of sweet spices. When it was used, it was to be beaten very small; thus it pleased the Lord to bruise the Redeemer, when he offered himself for a sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savour. The like should not be made for any common use. Thus God would keep in the people's minds reverence for his own services, and teach us not to profane or abuse any thing whereby God makes himself known. It is a great affront to God to jest with sacred things, and to make sport with his word and ordinances. It is most dangerous and fatal to use professions of the gospel of Christ to forward wordly interests.</body></html>
