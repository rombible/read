Hence the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews speaks of it as belonging, in a certain sense, to the Holy of Holies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-4.htm" title="Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;">Hebrews 9:4</a>; see Kay, in <span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>The "vail that is by the ark of the testimony" is distinguished here from the vail, or curtain, at the entrance to the holy place.<p><span class= "bld">Before the mercy seat.</span>--The altar bore a close relation to the mercy seat. It was the instrument by which the "mercy" there enthroned was made available to the penitent sinner.<p><span class= "bld">Where I will meet with thee.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-22.htm" title="And there I will meet with you, and I will commune with you from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are on the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give you in commandment to the children of Israel.">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/29-42.htm" title="This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there to you.">Exodus 29:42-43</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt put it</span> <span class="cmt_word">before the vail</span>. It might have been doubtful from what is said here, which side of the veil the altar was to be placed. The doubt is precluded by the narrative of what Moses actually did in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-21.htm">Exodus 40:21-29</a>, which makes it clear that the altar was placed with the golden candlestick and the table of shew-bread, outside the veil, in the "holy place," and not within the "holy of holies." <span class="cmt_word">Where I will meet with</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee.</span> See above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:1-10 The altar of incense represented the Son of God in his human nature, and the incense burned thereon typified his pleading for his people. The continual intercession of Christ was represented by the daily burning of incense thereon, morning and evening. Once every year the blood of the atonement was to be applied to it, denoting that the intercession of Christ has all its virtue from his sufferings on earth, and that we need no other sacrifice or intercessor but Christ alone.</body></html>
