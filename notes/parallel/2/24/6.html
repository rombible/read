The blood, which symbolised the life of the victim, was the essential part of every sacrifice, and was usually poured over the altar, or at any rate sprinkled upon it, as the very crowning act of offering. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-8.htm">Leviticus 3:8</a>; etc.) On this occasion Moses retained half of the blood, <span class="cmt_word">and put it in basins</span>, for the purpose of so uniting all the people in the sacrifice, and thereby the more solemnly pledging them to the covenant, which the sacrifice at once consecrated and consummated. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-18.htm">Hebrews 9:18-20</a>.) The other <span class="cmt_word">half of the blood</span> was, according to the usual practice, <span class="cmt_word">sprinkled upon the altar</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-8 A solemn covenant was made between God and Israel. Very solemn it was, typifying the covenant of grace between God and believers, through Christ. As soon as God separated to himself a peculiar people, he governed them by a written word, as he has done ever since. God's covenants and commands are so just in themselves, and so much for our good, that the more we think of them, and the more plainly and fully they are set before us, the more reason we may see to comply with them. The blood of the sacrifice was sprinkled on the altar, on the book, and on the people. Neither their persons, their moral obedience, nor religious services, would meet with acceptance from a holy God, except through the shedding and sprinkling' of blood. Also the blessings granted unto them were all of mercy; and the Lord would deal with them in kindness. Thus the sinner, by faith in the blood of Christ, renders willing and acceptable obedience.</body></html>
