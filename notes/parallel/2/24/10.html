and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.">Daniel 3:25</a>). It is not of this appearance that Moses says: "Ye saw no similitude" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-12.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only you heard a voice.">Deuteronomy 4:12</a>). The appearance which they saw had "feet."<p><span class= "bld">A paved work of a sapphire stone.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">a work of the clearness of sapphire. </span>The "sapphire" (<span class= "ital">sappir</span>) of the Pentateuch is probably <span class= "ital">lapis lazuli.</span><p><span class= "bld">The body of heaven</span>--i.e., "the very heaven," or "the heaven itself."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They saw the God of Israel</span>. These words can scarcely mean less than that they saw with their bodily eyes some appearance of the Divine being who had summoned them to his presence for the purpose. Moses, we know, saw a "similitude of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>). Isaiah "saw the Lord sitting upon his throne "(<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>). Ezekiel saw upon the throne "the appearance of a man" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>). It does not follow from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-12.htm">Deuteronomy 4:12, 15</a>, that <span class="accented">the elders</span> saw no similitude, since in that passage Moses is speaking, not to the elders, but to the people, and referring, not to what occurred at the sacrificial feast after the ratification of the covenant, but to the scene at the giving of the Ten Commandments previously (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-1.htm">Exodus 20:1-18</a>). What the form was which the elders saw, we are not told; but as it had "feet," it was probably a human form. It may have been hazy, indefinite, "too dazzling bright for mortal eye" to rest upon. But it was a true "vision of God" - and, as Keil says, "a foretaste of the blessedness of the sight of God in eternity." <span class="cmt_word">There was under his feet, as it were, a paved work of a sapphire stone.</span> Rather, "and under his feet was, as it were, a work of clear sapphire." Nothing is said concerning a pavement, but only that below the feet of the figure which they saw was something, which looked as if it were made of bright blue sapphire stone, something as clear and as blue as the blue of heaven. Canon Cook supposes the actual sky to be meant; but the expression, "<span class="accented">as it were</span>, the body of heaven," or "like the very heaven," makes this impossible. A thing is not like itself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:9-11 The elders saw the God of Israel; they had some glimpse of his glory, though whatever they saw, it was something of which no image or picture could be made, yet enough to satisfy them that God was with them of a truth. Nothing is described but what was under his feet. The sapphires are the pavement under his feet; let us put all the wealth of this world under our feet, and not in our hearts. Thus the believer sees in the face of Jesus Christ, far clearer discoveries of the glorious justice and holiness of God, than ever he saw under terrifying convictions; and through the Saviour, holds communion with a holy God.</body></html>
