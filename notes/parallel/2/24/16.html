The summons had been given to Moses, and he had obeyed it. He was there on the platform a little below the summit, ready, but waiting for a further call. The call was not made for six days. A holy calm reigned upon Sinai - the cloud rested upon the summit, and in the cloud was <span class="cmt_word">the glory of the Lord</span>. Moses and Joshua waited near - but for six days there was no sign. God thus taught Moses, and through him the world, that near approach to him requires long and careful preparation. Moses, no doubt, was occupied during <span class="cmt_word">the six days</span> in continual prayer. At last, <span class="cmt_word">on the seventh day</span>, the call, which Moses had expected, came. <span class="cmt_word">God called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud</span>. God summoned him to a closer approach - bade him enter the cloud - and draw as nigh to him as possible. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:12-18 A cloud covered the mount six days; a token of God's special presence there. Moses was sure that he who called him up would protect him. Even those glorious attributes of God which are most terrible to the wicked, the saints with humble reverence rejoice in. And through faith in the atoning Sacrifice, we hope for greater honour than Moses ever enjoyed on earth. Now we see through a glass darkly, but when he shall appear, then face to face. This vision of God will continue with equal, if not increasing brightness of joy; not for a few days only, but through eternity.</body></html>
