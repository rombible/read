The omission of the nominative is probably to be accounted for by the insertion into Exodus at this point of "the Book of the Covenant," which was originally a distinct document. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-1.htm" title="And he said to Moses, Come up to the LORD, you, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship you afar off.">Exodus 24:1</a> of Exodus 24 probably followed originally on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-21.htm" title="And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.">Exodus 20:21</a> of Exodus 20. The sequence of the words was then as follows: "And Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was. And he said unto Moses," &c.<p><span class= "bld">Come up.</span>--The ascent of Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy elders seems to have been commanded in order to give greater solemnity to the ratification of the covenant between God and Israel, which is the main subject of this section. Moses received instructions on the subject before descending, and no doubt was divinely guided in the steps which he took previously to ascending with them.<p><span class= "bld">Nadab, and Abihu.</span>--Aaron's two elder sons. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-23.htm" title="And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bore him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.">Exodus 6:23</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Seventy of the elders.</span>--These are not the "judges" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/18-21.htm" title="Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:">Exodus 18:21-26</a>, who were not yet appointed (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/18-24.htm" title="So Moses listened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.">Exodus 18:24-25</a>), but rather the heads of tribes and families who had exercised authority over the Israelites in Egypt, and through whom Moses had always communicated with the people. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-16.htm" title="Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:">Exodus 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-29.htm" title="And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:">Exodus 4:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-21.htm" title="Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.">Exodus 12:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/17-5.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Go on before the people, and take with you of the elders of Israel; and your rod, with which you smote the river, take in your hand, and go.">Exodus 17:5-6</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - THE RATIFICATION OF THE COVENANT. The giving of the Book of the Covenant being now completed, Moses, having received directions with respect to another ascent into the mount (vers. 1, 2), descended to the people, and in the first instance declared to them the main heads of the Covenant, which they received with favour, and expressed their willingness to obey (ver. 3). Not, however, regarding this as a sufficiently formal ratification, the Prophet proceeded to write out in a "Book" the whole of the commands which he had received, He then built an altar, erected twelve pillars, offered sacrifice, and having collected half the blood of the victims in basins, summoned the people to an assembly. At this, he read over solemnly all the words of the Book to them, and received their solemn adherence to it (ver. 7); whereupon, to complete the ceremony, and mark their entrance into covenant, he sprinkled the blood from the basins on the twelve tribes, represented by their leaders, and declared the acceptance complete (ver. 8). The ceremony was probably modelled on some customary proceedings, whereby important contracts between man and man were ratified among the Hebrews and Syrians. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - It has been supposed that these verses are out of place, and suggested to remove them to the end of verse 8. But no change is necessary. It is quite natural that God should have given the directions before Moses descended from the mount, and that he should have deferred executing them until the people had accepted the covenant. <span class="cmt_word">Nadab and Abihu</span> were the two eldest of Aaron's sons, and so his natural successors in the priesthood, had they not sinned by offering "strange fire" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1, 2</a>). They had been mentioned previously, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-23.htm">Exodus 6:23</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Seventy of the elders</span>. On the elders of Israel, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a>, and Exodus 18:21. The "seventy" eiders may, together with Nadab and Abihu, have represented the twelve tribes, six from each. <span class="cmt_word">Worship</span> <span class="cmt_word">ye afar off</span>. Though all were to ascend the mount to a certain height, only Moses was to go to the top. The others, being less holy than Moses, had to worship at a distance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-8 A solemn covenant was made between God and Israel. Very solemn it was, typifying the covenant of grace between God and believers, through Christ. As soon as God separated to himself a peculiar people, he governed them by a written word, as he has done ever since. God's covenants and commands are so just in themselves, and so much for our good, that the more we think of them, and the more plainly and fully they are set before us, the more reason we may see to comply with them. The blood of the sacrifice was sprinkled on the altar, on the book, and on the people. Neither their persons, their moral obedience, nor religious services, would meet with acceptance from a holy God, except through the shedding and sprinkling' of blood. Also the blessings granted unto them were all of mercy; and the Lord would deal with them in kindness. Thus the sinner, by faith in the blood of Christ, renders willing and acceptable obedience.</body></html>
