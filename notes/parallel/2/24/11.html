As they feasted on the sacrificial meal, the vision of God was made manifest to them. It is impossible to doubt that we have here a precious forecast of the Christian's highest privilege--the realisation of the presence of God in the sacred feast of the Holy Communion.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The nobles</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the notables - the seventy elders, and other persons, already mentioned (vers. 1, 9). <span class="cmt_word">He laid not his hand</span>. God did not smite them with death, or pestilence, or even blindness. It was thought to be impossible to see God and live.

Yet some times he chose to show himself, in vision or otherwise, to his people, and then, as there could be no guilt on their part, there was no punishment on his. It is generally supposed that, in all such cases, it was the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity who condescended to show himself. <span class="cmt_word">Also they saw God</span>.

Nothing is described but what was under his feet. The sapphires are the pavement under his feet; let us put all the wealth of this world under our feet, and not in our hearts. Thus the believer sees in the face of Jesus Christ, far clearer discoveries of the glorious justice and holiness of God, than ever he saw under terrifying convictions; and through the Saviour, holds communion with a holy God.</body></html>
