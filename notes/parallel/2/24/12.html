A series of laws had been laid down for the nation and accepted with unanimity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-3.htm" title="And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD has said will we do.">Exodus 24:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-7.htm" title="And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD has said will we do, and be obedient.">Exodus 24:7</a>). But "<span class= "ital">quid prosunt leges sine moribus</span>?" It was necessary for the sustentation of the religious life of the people that a sacred polity should be instituted, a form of worship set up, and regulations established with regard to all the externals of religion--holy persons, holy places, rites, ceremonies, vestments, incense, consecration. Moses was directed to ascend into the mount, and hold prolonged communion with God, in order that he might learn the mind of God with respect to all these things. His prolonged stay for "forty days and forty nights" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-18.htm" title="And Moses went into the middle of the cloud, and got him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.">Exodus 24:18</a>) was necessary to give him a full and complete knowledge of all the details so elaborately set forth in Exodus 25-30, and again in Exodus 35-40, which thenceforth constituted the essentials of the external worship of Israel, whereby the minds and habits of the people were moulded and impressed in a far more efficacious way than could ever have been done by a mere set of abstract propositions, appealing only to the intellect. "<span class= "ital">Segnius irritant animum demissa per aures, Quam qu? sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus." </span>The Decalogue and the Book of the Covenant had no doubt a considerable share in forming the character of the Hebrew nation; but a larger share must be assigned to the ritual and ceremonial which Moses was now instructed to set up, and which forms the main subject of the remainder of the Book.<p>(12) <span class= "bld">Come up to me into the mount, and be there.</span>--After the sacrificial meal, the seventy-four persons engaged in it had descended into the plain of Er-Rahah, and possibly spent some time there, before a second summons came to Moses. This time he was directed to ascend accompanied only by his minister, Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-13.htm" title="And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God.">Exodus 24:13</a>), and was warned that his stay was to be a prolonged one in the words, "And <span class= "ital">be there."</span><p><span class= "bld">And I will give thee tables of stone . . . --</span>It is remarkable that these are not expressly said, either here or in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm" title="And he gave to Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him on mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.">Exodus 31:18</a>, to have contained the ten commandments. The fact, however, is distinctly stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-22.htm" title="These words the LORD spoke to all your assembly in the mount out of the middle of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them to me.">Deuteronomy 5:22</a>; and with respect to the second tables, the same is affirmed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-28.htm" title="And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote on the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.">Exodus 34:28</a>. The fiction of a double decalogue is thus precluded.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-18.</span> - MOSES' ENTRY INTO THE CLOUD, AND FORTY DAYS' COMMUNE WITH GOD. It was necessary now that Moses should receive full directions for the external worship of God, the sanctuary, and the priesthood. Every religion has something tangible and material about it - holy places, holy things, rites, ceremonies, rules, forms, regulations. If man sets himself to devise these things of his own head, he may very easily go wrong, and find his elaborate inventions "an offence" to God. To avoid this - to secure the result that all should be pleasing and acceptable to "the High and Holy One which inhabiteth eternity," it was thought fitting that "patterns" should be shown to Moses of all that was to be made for the worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>), and exact details given him with respect to the material, size, shape, and construction of each. The results are put before us in seven chapters (chs. 25-31.). For the purpose of allowing ample time for the communications which had to be made and of securing that undivided attention which was requisite in order that all should remain fixed in the memory, God summoned his servant to a long and solitary colloquy, on the mountain summit whereon the cloud rested (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>), apart from all his people. Moses, of course, obeyed; but before ascending, arranged with the elders that in his absence Aaron and Hur should have the direction of affairs, and decide all doubtful questions (ver. 14). He then went up the mountain, accompanied for part of the way by Joshua, who is now spoken of as his "minister," or "attendant" (ver. 13). Joshua probably remained with him for six days, while Moses waited for a summons to enter the cloud. On the seventh day the summons came: and Moses, leaving Joshua, entered the cloud, and was hid from the sight of all men. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Come up to me</span>. Moses, apparently, had descended again into the plain, with Aaron and the seventy elders, after the festival was over. (See ver. 14, and compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-1.htm">Exodus 32:1</a>.) He is now commanded to reascend, <span class="cmt_word">and be</span> <span class="cmt_word">there</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "And continue there" - foreshadowing the length of the stay. <span class="cmt_word">Tables of stone, and a law, and commandments</span>, etc. Literally, "Tables of stone, and <span class="accented">the</span> law and the commandments which I have written." The three expressions alike refer to the Decalogue, which alone God <span class="accented">wrote</span>. <span class="cmt_word">That thou mayest teach them</span>. Rather," to teach them." God wrote the commandments on stone, in order to inculcate them with the greater force upon his people. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:12-18 A cloud covered the mount six days; a token of God's special presence there. Moses was sure that he who called him up would protect him. Even those glorious attributes of God which are most terrible to the wicked, the saints with humble reverence rejoice in. And through faith in the atoning Sacrifice, we hope for greater honour than Moses ever enjoyed on earth. Now we see through a glass darkly, but when he shall appear, then face to face. This vision of God will continue with equal, if not increasing brightness of joy; not for a few days only, but through eternity.</body></html>
