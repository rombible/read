Thus the two parties to the covenant, sprinkled with the blood of the same sacrifices, were brought into sacramental union. Rites somewhat similar, involving blood communion, were common throughout the East in connection with covenants (Horn. <span class= "ital">Il. iii.</span> 298, xix. 252; Herod. I. 74, iii. 8, iv. 70; Xen. <span class= "ital">Anab. ii.</span> 2, ? 9; Lucian. <span class= "ital">Toxar. </span>37; Pomp. <span class= "ital">Mel. </span>ii. 1; Tac. <span class= "ital">Ann. xii.</span> 47; &c), and were regarded as adding to their force and sacredness.<p><span class= "bld">On the people.</span>--It has been suggested (Abarbarnel) that the blood was really sprinkled on the twelve pillars which represented the people; but the words used scarcely seem to admit of such an interpretation. The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews understood the passage as declaring that the people were sprinkled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-19.htm" title="For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,">Hebrews 9:19</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - Moses then proceeded to the final act - He took the blood from the basins, <span class="cmt_word">and sprinkled it</span> - not certainly upon all the people, who numbered above two millions - but upon their leaders and representatives, the "elders" and other chief men, drawn up at the head of each tribe, and thus brought within his reach. It has been supposed by some that he merely sprinkled the blood on the twelve pillars, as representing the twelve tribes; but, had this been the case, the expression in the text would probably have been different. We read, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, that he "sprinkled both the book, <span class="accented">and all the people"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-19.htm">Hebrews 9:19</a>). As he sprinkled, he said, <span class="cmt_word">Behold the blood of the covenant</span>, etc. It was a common practice among the nations of antiquity to seal covenants with blood. Sometimes the blood was that of a victim, and the two parties to the covenant prayed, that, if they broke it, his fate might be theirs (Hom. <span class="accented">1l.</span> 3:298; 19:252; Leviticus 1:24; 21:45; etc.). Sometimes it was the blood of the two parties themselves, who each drank of the other's blood, and thereby contracted a blood-relationship, which would have made their breaking the covenant more unpardonable (Herod. 1:74; 4:70; Tacit. <span class="accented">Ann</span>. 12:47). Moses seems to have followed neither practice at all closely, but, adopting simply the principle that a covenant required to be sealed with blood, to have arranged the details as he thought best. By the sprinkling of both the altar and the people the two parties to the covenant were made partakers of one and the same blood, and so brought into a sort of sacramental union. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 24:9-11 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-8 A solemn covenant was made between God and Israel. Very solemn it was, typifying the covenant of grace between God and believers, through Christ. As soon as God separated to himself a peculiar people, he governed them by a written word, as he has done ever since. God's covenants and commands are so just in themselves, and so much for our good, that the more we think of them, and the more plainly and fully they are set before us, the more reason we may see to comply with them. The blood of the sacrifice was sprinkled on the altar, on the book, and on the people. Neither their persons, their moral obedience, nor religious services, would meet with acceptance from a holy God, except through the shedding and sprinkling' of blood. Also the blessings granted unto them were all of mercy; and the Lord would deal with them in kindness. Thus the sinner, by faith in the blood of Christ, renders willing and acceptable obedience.</body></html>
