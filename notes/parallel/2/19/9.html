The second step was now to be taken. The terms of the covenant must be declared, and it pleased God to declare them, or, at any rate, the most important and fundamental of them, in the hearing of the people. He therefore makes the announcement of His approaching manifestation of Himself, and proceeds to give directions connected with <span class= "bld">it </span>to Moses.<p><span class= "bld">Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">in the denseness of a cloud. </span>Though God is light--nay, because He is light, clouds and darkness are round about Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-2.htm" title="Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.">Psalm 97:2</a>). Even when He reveals Himself. He still "dwells in the thick darkness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-1.htm" title="Then said Solomon, The LORD has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.">2Chronicles 6:1</a>). It is absolutely necessary that He should be closely veiled when He draws near to men, for otherwise they could not endure for a moment "the brightness of His presence." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-35.htm" title="And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud stayed thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.">Exodus 40:35</a> :<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-14.htm" title="So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.">2Chronicles 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-2.htm" title="And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD's house.">2Chronicles 7:2</a>.) If even the light that remained on Moses' face after converse with God required him thenceforth ordinarily to wear a veil before the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/34-33.htm" title="And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.">Exodus 34:33-35</a>), how much more needful must it be that God should cover His face when He condescends to converse with men! In the present case, it would seem to have been "the pillar of the cloud" that had guided Israel, which served Him for a covering, and out of which He spake to Moses and the people.<p><span class= "bld">That the people may hear . . . and believe thee for ever.</span>--God's purpose in manifesting Himself to the people was twofold :--(1) To impress them with the awful sense of His presence, and through them, their descendants; (2) to make them more ready to submit to Moses, and "believe him for ever." On the whole, it must be said that the purpose was accomplished. God has remained to the Israelites, for more than three millennia, an awful power, real, personal, tremendous. The Law of Moses, under whatever false interpretations, has remained the guide of their life. Though the living Moses was often resisted and contemned, the dead Moses has been reverenced and obeyed from his death to the present time. His laws are still accepted and professedly obeyed by the entire Jewish community.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I came unto thee in a thick cloud</span>. Literally, "in the thickness of a cloud." God must always veil himself when he speaks with man, for man could not bear "the brightness of his presence." If he takes a human form that form is a veil; if he appears in a burning bush, the very. fire is a shroud. On the present occasion it was the more needful that he should cover himself up, as he was about to draw near to the whole congregation, among whom were many-who were impure and impenitent. It was necessary, in order that all might be convinced of the Divine mission of Moses, for all to be so near as to hear him speak out of the cloud; but sinners cannot abide the near presence of God, unless he is carefully hidden away from them. Probably, the cloud out of which he now spoke was that which had accompanied the Israelites out of Egypt, and directed their march (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21, 22</a>), though this is not distinctly stated. <span class="cmt_word">That the people may believe thee for ever</span>. In "the people" are included their descendants; and they are to "believe Moses <span class="accented">for</span> <span class="accented">ever</span>, because the law is in some sense of eternal obligation on all men" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord.</span> It is not easy to assign a reason for the repetition of this clause from vers. 8, in almost identical terms. There were no fresh "words of the people" to report. We can only say that such seemingly needless repetitions are <span class="accented">in the</span> <span class="accented">manner</span> of archaic writers, who seem to intend in this way to emphasise a fact. The acceptance of the covenant by the people beforehand, completed by Moses reporting it to God, is the necessary basis of all that follows - the required preliminary to the giving of any covenant at all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 19:10-15 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:9-15 The solemn manner in which the law was delivered, was to impress the people with a right sense of the Divine majesty. Also to convince them of their own guilt, and to show that they could not stand in judgment before God by their own obedience. In the law, the sinner discovers what he ought to be, what he is, and what he wants. There he learns the nature, necessity, and glory of redemption, and of being made holy. Having been taught to flee to Christ, and to love him, the law is the rule of his obedience and faith.</body></html>
