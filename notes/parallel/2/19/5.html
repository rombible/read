(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-3.htm" title="Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of my own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house.">1Chronicles 29:3</a>, where the English Version translates it by "mine own proper good.") God views the Israelites as made His own by the long series of mighty works done for their deliverance, whereby He is sometimes said to have "redeemed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-6.htm" title="Why say to the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:">Exodus 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-13.htm" title="You in your mercy have led forth the people which you have redeemed: you have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation.">Exodus 15:13</a>), or "purchased" them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-16.htm" title="Fear and dread shall fall on them; by the greatness of your arm they shall be as still as a stone; till your people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which you have purchased.">Exodus 15:16</a>). The word <span class= "ital">s?gullah </span>is here used for the first time. Later it be comes an <span class= "ital">epitheton usitatum </span>of Israel. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-6.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God: the LORD your God has chosen you to be a special people to himself, above all people that are on the face of the earth.">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-2.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God, and the LORD has chosen you to be a peculiar people to himself, above all the nations that are on the earth.">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-18.htm" title="And the LORD has avouched you this day to be his peculiar people, as he has promised you, and that you should keep all his commandments;">Deuteronomy 26:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-4.htm" title="For the LORD has chosen Jacob to himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.">Psalm 135:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-17.htm" title="And they shall be mine, said the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son that serves him.">Malachi 3:17</a>; and comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm" title="Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.">Titus 2:14</a>;1Pe 2:9.)<p><span class= "bld">Above all people: for all the earth is mine.</span>--While claiming a peculiar right in Israel, God does not mean to separate Himself from the other nations, to cease to care for them, or give them up to their own devices. He is always "the Most High <span class= "ital">over all the earth</span>" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-18.htm" title="That men may know that you, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, are the most high over all the earth.">Psalm 83:18</a>), "a light to lighten <span class= "ital">the Gentiles," </span>one who "judges <span class= "ital">the people </span>righteously, and <span class= "ital">governs all the nations upon earth" </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/67-4.htm" title="O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for you shall judge the people righteously, and govern the nations on earth. Selah.">Psalm 67:4</a>). Israel's prerogative does not rob them of their birthright. He is the favoured son; but they, too, "are, all of them, children of the Most High" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/82-6.htm" title="I have said, You are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.">Psalm 82:6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore</span>. Instead of asking the simple question - "Will ye promise to obey me and keep my covenant. - God graciously entices the Israelites to their own advantage by a most loving promise. If they will agree to obey his voice, and accept and keep his covenant, then they shall be to him <span class="cmt_word">a peculiar treasure</span> (<span class="accented">segullah</span>) - a precious possession to be esteemed highly and carefully guarded from all that might injure it. (Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-4.htm">Psalm 135:4</a>; and see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1-4</a>.) and this preciousness they shall not share with others on equal terms, but enjoy exclusively - it shall be theirs <span class="cmt_word">above</span> <span class="cmt_word">all</span> <span class="cmt_word">people.</span> No other nation on the earth shall hold the position which they shall hold, or be equally precious in God's sight. All the earth is his: and so all nations are his in a certain sense. But this shall not interfere with the special Israelite prerogative they alone shall be his "peculiar people" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-2.htm">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-8 Moses was called up the mountain, and was employed as the messenger of this covenant. The Maker and first Mover of the covenant, is God himself. This blessed charter was granted out of God's own free grace. The covenant here mentioned was the national covenant, by which the Israelites were a people under the government of Jehovah. It was a type of the new covenant made with true believers in Christ Jesus; but, like other types, it was only a shadow of good things to come. As a nation they broke this covenant; therefore the Lord declared that he would make a new covenant with Israel, writing his law, not upon tables of stone, but in their hearts, Jer 31:33; Heb 8:7-10. The covenant spoken of in these places as ready to vanish away, is the national covenant with Israel, which they forfeited by their sins. Unless we carefully attend to this, we shall fall into mistakes while reading the Old Testament. We must not suppose that the nation of the Jews were under the covenant of works, which knows nothing of repentance, faith in a Mediator, forgiveness of sins, or grace; nor yet that the whole nation of Israel bore the character, and possessed the privileges of true believers, as being actually sharers in the covenant of grace. They were all under a dispensation of mercy; they had outward privileges and advantages for salvation; but, like professing Christians, most rested therein, and went no further. Israel consented to the conditions. They answered as one man, All that the Lord hath spoken we will do. Oh that there had been such a heart in them! Moses, as a mediator, returned the words of the people to God. Thus Christ, the Mediator, as a Prophet, reveals God's will to us, his precepts and promises; and then, as a Priest, offers up to God our spiritual sacrifices, not only of prayer and praise, but of devout affections, and pious resolutions, the work of his own Spirit in us.</body></html>
