The warning is required, and is to be given. Moses, submissive as usual, yields, and "goes down unto the people and speaks unto them." The result is that no attempt to break through the barrier is made.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said...</span> <span class="cmt_word">Away, Get thee down.</span> God wholly rejected the plea of Moses, that there was no need to give an additional warning. <span class="accented">He knew best</span>, and would not have issued the order to "go down and charge the people "(ver. 21), unless there had been a need for it. In the abrupt words "Away, get thee down," we may see a rebuke, addressed to Moses, for his folly in thinking that he could change the purposes of God. <span class="cmt_word">Thou and Aaron with thee.</span> This is the first express mention of Aaron as called to ascend with Moses. But it is quite possible that he may have accompanied his brother in either or both the previous ascents (vers. 3, 20. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-1.htm">Exodus 10:1, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-21.htm">Exodus 12:21, 28</a>; etc.) <span class="cmt_word">But let not the priests and the people break</span> <span class="cmt_word">through</span>. Both the <span class="accented">priests</span> and the people were to be again solemnly warned that it would be death to break through the fence. This warning seems to have been sufficient. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:16-25 Never was there such a sermon preached, before or since, as this which was preached to the church in the wilderness. It might be supposed that the terrors would have checked presumption and curiosity in the people; but the hard heart of an unawakened sinner can trifle with the most terrible threatenings and judgments. In drawing near to God, we must never forget his holiness and greatness, nor our own meanness and pollution. We cannot stand in judgment before him according to his righteous law. The convinced transgressor asks, What must I do to be saved? and he hears the voice, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved. The Holy Ghost, who made the law to convince of sin, now takes of the things of Christ, and shows them to us. In the gospel we read, Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us. We have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins. Through him we are justified from all things, from which we could not be justified by the law of Moses. But the Divine law is binding as a rule of life. The Son of God came down from heaven, and suffered poverty, shame, agony, and death, not only to redeem us from its curse, but to bind us more closely to keep its commands.</body></html>
