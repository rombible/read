(<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/4-11.htm" title="And you came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the middle of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.">Deuteronomy 4:11-12</a>), which is fuller in some respects:--"Ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain <span class= "ital">burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, </span>with darkness, clouds, and <span class= "ital">thick darkness. </span>And the Lord spake unto you out of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice." The phenomena accumulated to impress the people seem to have been loud thunder, fierce flashes of lightning, a fire that streamed up from the mountain to the middle of the sky, dense volumes of smoke producing an awful and weird darkness, a trembling of the mountain as by a continuous earthquake, a sound like the blare of a trumpet loud and prolonged, and then finally a clear penetrating voice. So awful a manifestation has never been made at any other place or time, nor will be until the consummation of all things. To regard it as a mere "storm of thunder and lightning," or as "an earthquake with volcanic eruptions," is to miss altogether the meaning of the author, and to empty his narrative of all its natural significance.<p><span class= "bld">The voice of the trumpet.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">a voice of a trumpet. </span>The trumpet's blare is the signal of a herald calling attention to a proclamation about to be made. At the last day the coming of Christ is to be announced by "the trump of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm" title="For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:">1Thessalonians 4:16</a>). In the Apocalypse angels are often represented as sounding with trumpets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/8-7.htm" title="The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast on the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.">Revelation 8:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-10.htm" title="And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell on the third part of the rivers, and on the fountains of waters;">Revelation 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-12.htm" title="And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.">Revelation 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-1.htm" title="And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.">Revelation 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-14.htm" title="Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.">Revelation 9:14</a>, &c.) when some great event is about to occur.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-20.</span> - THE MANIFESTATION OF GOD UPON SINAI. All was ready. The fence had been made (ver. 23); the people had purified themselves - at least so far as externals went. The third day was come - there was a breathless hush of expectation. Then suddenly, in the morning, the presence manifested itself. "There were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud" (ver. 16); "and Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace and the whole mount quaked greatly" (ver. 18) Or, as the scene is elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-11.htm">Deuteronomy 4:11, 12</a>) described by Moses - "Ye came near and stood under the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire <span class="accented">unto the midst of heaven</span>, with darkness, clouds, and <span class="accented">thick darkness</span>. And the Lord spoke unto you <span class="accented">out of the midst of the fire</span>: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice." The phenomena were not a mere "storm of thunder and lightning, whereof Moses took advantage to persuade the people that they had heard God's voice" - not "an earthquake with volcanic eruptions" - not even these two combined - but a real theophany, in which amid the phenomena of storm and tempest, and fire and smoke, and thick darkness, and hearings of the ground as by an earthquake shock, first the loud blast of a trumpet sounded long commanding attention, and then a clear penetrating voice, like that of a man, made itself heard in distinctly articulated words, audible to the whole multitude, and recognised by them as superhuman - as "the voice of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-33.htm">Deuteronomy 4:33</a>). It is in vain to seek to minimise, and to rationalise the scene, and tone it down into something not supernatural. The only honest course is either to accept it as a plain record of plain (albeit miraculous) facts, or to reject it altogether as the fiction of a romancer. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There were thunders</span>. Literally, "voices," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23</a>; but there can be no doubt that "thunder" is meant. <span class="cmt_word">A thick cloud</span>. Compare above, ver. 9, and the comment ad loc. <span class="cmt_word">The voice of the trumpet</span>. Literally, "a trumpet's voice." The word used for "trumpet" is not the same as in ver. 13; but the variation does not seem to have any importance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:16-25 Never was there such a sermon preached, before or since, as this which was preached to the church in the wilderness. It might be supposed that the terrors would have checked presumption and curiosity in the people; but the hard heart of an unawakened sinner can trifle with the most terrible threatenings and judgments. In drawing near to God, we must never forget his holiness and greatness, nor our own meanness and pollution. We cannot stand in judgment before him according to his righteous law. The convinced transgressor asks, What must I do to be saved? and he hears the voice, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved. The Holy Ghost, who made the law to convince of sin, now takes of the things of Christ, and shows them to us. In the gospel we read, Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us. We have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins. Through him we are justified from all things, from which we could not be justified by the law of Moses. But the Divine law is binding as a rule of life. The Son of God came down from heaven, and suffered poverty, shame, agony, and death, not only to redeem us from its curse, but to bind us more closely to keep its commands.</body></html>
