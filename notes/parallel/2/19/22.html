It is a reasonable conjecture that hitherto the heads of families had exercised sacerdotal functions.<p><span class= "bld">Break forth</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., punish in some open and manifest way. </span>Compare the "breach" upon Uzzah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-8.htm" title="And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach on Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.">2Samuel 6:8</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let the priests also</span>. It has been objected, that no priests had been as yet appointed, and that we have here therefore an anachronism. But every nation in ancient times had priests, appointed on one principle or another: and the Levitical priesthood must be regarded as having superseded one previously existent, not as the first priesthood known to Israel. We have a second mention of priests, previous to the appointment of Aaron's sons to the office (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5</a>), which confirms the present passage. <span class="cmt_word">Sanctify</span> <span class="cmt_word">themselves.</span> The verb used is identical with that which occurs in ver. 10; and there is no reason to believe that any different sanctification was intended. The natural inference is that the priests had neglected to sanctify themselves. (See the introductory paragraph.) <span class="cmt_word">Lest the Lord break forth</span>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-8.htm">2 Samuel 6:8</a>, where we have an instance of such a "breaking forth" upon Uzzah. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:16-25 Never was there such a sermon preached, before or since, as this which was preached to the church in the wilderness. It might be supposed that the terrors would have checked presumption and curiosity in the people; but the hard heart of an unawakened sinner can trifle with the most terrible threatenings and judgments. In drawing near to God, we must never forget his holiness and greatness, nor our own meanness and pollution. We cannot stand in judgment before him according to his righteous law. The convinced transgressor asks, What must I do to be saved? and he hears the voice, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved. The Holy Ghost, who made the law to convince of sin, now takes of the things of Christ, and shows them to us. In the gospel we read, Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us. We have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins. Through him we are justified from all things, from which we could not be justified by the law of Moses. But the Divine law is binding as a rule of life. The Son of God came down from heaven, and suffered poverty, shame, agony, and death, not only to redeem us from its curse, but to bind us more closely to keep its commands.</body></html>
