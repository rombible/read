The meaning is, beyond all doubt, "There shall not a hand touch <span class= "ital">him," i.e., </span>the transgressor. To stop him and seize him, another person must have transgressed the bounds, and so have repeated the act which was forbidden. This course was to be avoided, and punishment was to be inflicted on the transgressor by stoning him, or transfixing him with arrows, from within the barrier.<p><span class= "bld">Whether it be beast or man.</span>--Though beasts are innocent of wrong-doing, and are thus no proper objects of punishment, yet the law of God requires their slaughter in certain eases--<span class= "ital">e.g. </span>(1) when they are dangerous (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-28.htm" title="If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.">Exodus 21:28</a>); (2) when they have become polluted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-15.htm" title="And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and you shall slay the beast.">Leviticus 20:15</a>); (3) When their owner's sin is appropriately punished through their loss (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-13.htm" title="And every firstling of an ass you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among your children shall you redeem.">Exodus 13:13</a>). In the present case, it could only be through the culpable carelessness of an owner that a beast could get inside the barrier.<p><span class= "bld">When the trumpet soundeth long.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-19.htm" title="And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.">Exodus 19:19</a>.<p><span class= "bld">They shall come up to the mount.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">into the mount. </span>The expression used is identical with that of the preceding verse, and there rendered "go up into the mount." Thus the act forbidden in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-12.htm" title="And you shall set bounds to the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that you go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whoever touches the mount shall be surely put to death:">Exodus 19:12</a> is allowed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-13.htm" title="There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mount.">Exodus 19:13</a>; it is not, however, allowed to the same persons. The word "they" (<span class= "ital">hemah</span>) in this present place is emphatic, and refers to certain privileged persons, as Moses and Aaron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-24.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, Away, get you down, and you shall come up, you, and Aaron with you: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD, lest he break forth on them.">Exodus 19:24</a>), not to the people generally.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There shall not an hand touch it</span>. Rather, "there shall not an hand touch <span class="accented">him</span>." The transgressor shall not be seized and apprehended, for that would involve the repetition of the offence by his arrester, who must overpass the "bounds" set by Moses, in order to make the arrest. Instead of seizing him, they were to kill him with stones or arrows from within the "bounds," and the same was to be done, if any stray beast approached the mountain. <span class="cmt_word">When the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount</span>. By translating the same Hebrew phrase differently here and in verse 12, the A. V. avoids the difficulty which most commentators see in this passage. According to the apparent construction, the people are first told that they may, on no account, ascend the mountain (ver. ,12), and then that they may do so, so soon as the trumpet sounds long (ver. 13). But they do not ascend at that time (ver. 19), nor are they allowed to do so - on the contrary, Moses is charged anew to prevent it (ver. 21-25); nor indeed do <span class="accented">the</span> <span class="accented">people</span> ever ascend, but only Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy eiders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-1.htm">Exodus 24:1, 2</a>). What, then, is the permission here given? When we scrutinise the passage closely, we observe that the pronoun "they" is in the Hebrew, <span class="accented">emphatic</span>, and, therefore, unlikely to refer to "the people" of ver. 12. To whom then does it refer? Not, certainly, to "the Elders" of ver. 7, which would be too remote an antecedent, but to those chosen persons who are in the writer's mind, whom God was about to allow to ascend. Even these were not allowed to go up until summoned by the prolonged blast of the trumpet. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:9-15 The solemn manner in which the law was delivered, was to impress the people with a right sense of the Divine majesty. Also to convince them of their own guilt, and to show that they could not stand in judgment before God by their own obedience. In the law, the sinner discovers what he ought to be, what he is, and what he wants. There he learns the nature, necessity, and glory of redemption, and of being made holy. Having been taught to flee to Christ, and to love him, the law is the rule of his obedience and faith.</body></html>
