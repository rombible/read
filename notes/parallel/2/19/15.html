A similar obligation lay on the Egyptian priests (Porphyr. <span class="accented">De Abstin</span>. 4:7); and the idea which underlies it was widespread in the ancient world (See Herod. 1:198; Hesiod. <span class="accented">Op. et Di</span>. 733-4; Tibul. <span class="accented">Carm</span>. 2:1; 51:11, 12.)

Also to convince them of their own guilt, and to show that they could not stand in judgment before God by their own obedience. In the law, the sinner discovers what he ought to be, what he is, and what he wants. There he learns the nature, necessity, and glory of redemption, and of being made holy. Having been taught to flee to Christ, and to love him, the law is the rule of his obedience and faith.</body></html>
