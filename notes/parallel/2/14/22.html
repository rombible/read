<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-11.htm" title="The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.">Proverbs 18:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-1.htm" title="In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.">Isaiah 26:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-18.htm" title="For, behold, I have made you this day a defended city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.">Jeremiah 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-8.htm" title="Are you better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was from the sea?">Nahum 3:8</a>). In the present case, the waters protected Israel on either flank--the Red Sea upon the right, the Bitter Lakes upon the left. Poetical writers, as was natural, used language still more highly metaphorical (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-13.htm" title="He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.">Psalm 78:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-8.htm" title="And with the blast of your nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.">Exodus 15:8</a>), and spoke of the waters as "standing on an heap." Hence, some moderns have gone so far as to maintain that on this occasion the water "gave up its nature, formed with its waves a strong wall, and instead of streaming like a fluid, congealed into a hard substance" (Kalisch). But this is to turn poetry into prose, and enslave oneself to a narrow literalism.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The waters were a wall</span> - i<span class="accented">.e.</span>, a protection, a defence. Pharaoh could not attack them on either flank, on account of the two bodies of water between which their march lay. He could only come at them by following after them. The metaphor has been by some understood literally, especially on account of the expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a> - "The floods stood upright as an heap;" and again that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-13.htm">Psalm 78:13</a> - "He made the waters to stand as an heap." But those phrases, occurring in poems, must be taken as poetical; and can scarcely have any weight in determining the meaning of "wall" here. We must ask ourselves - is there not an economy and a restraint in the exertion by God even of miraculous power? - is more used than is needed for the occasion? - and would not all that was needed at this time have been effected by such a division of the sea as we have supposed, without the fluid being converted into a solid, or having otherwise the laws of its being entirely altered. Kalisch's statement, that the word "wall" here is "not intended to convey the idea of protection, but only of hardness and solidity," seems to us the very reverse of the truth. Protection is at any rate the main idea, and any other is secondary and subordinate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 14:23-31 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:21-31 The dividing the Red sea was the terror of the Canaanites, Jos 2:9; the praise and triumph of the Israelites, Ps 114:3; 106:9; 136:13. It was a type of baptism, 1Co 10:1,2. Israel's passage through it was typical of the conversion of souls, Isa 11:15; and the Egyptians being drowned in it was typical of the final ruin of all unrepenting sinners. God showed his almighty power, by opening a passage through the waters, some miles over. God can bring his people through the greatest difficulties, and force a way where he does not find it. It was an instance of his wonderful favour to his Israel. They went through the sea, they walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea. This was done, in order to encourage God's people in all ages to trust him in the greatest straits. What cannot he do who did this? What will not he do for those that fear and love him, who did this for these murmuring, unbelieving Israelites? Then followed the just and righteous wrath of God upon his and his people's enemies. The ruin of sinners is brought on by their own rage and presumption. They might have let Israel alone, and would not; now they would flee from the face of Israel, and cannot. Men will not be convinced, till it is too late, that those who meddle with God's people, meddle to their own hurt. Moses was ordered to stretch out his hand over the sea; the waters returned, and overwhelmed all the host of the Egyptians. Pharaoh and his servants, who had hardened one another in sin, now fell together, not one escaped. The Israelites saw the Egyptians dead upon the sands. The sight very much affected them. While men see God's works, and feel the benefit, they fear him and trust in him. How well were it for us, if we were always in as good a frame as sometimes! Behold the end to which a Christian may look forward. His enemies rage, and are mighty; but while he holds fast by God, he shall pass the waves in safety guarded by that very power of his Saviour, which shall come down on every spiritual foe. The enemies of his soul whom he hath seen to-day, he shall see no more for ever.</body></html>
