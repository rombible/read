In returning and rest shall you be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and you would not.">Isaiah 30:15</a>). So long as we have means of resistance put in our power, with a reasonable prospect of success, it is our duty to use them--to exert ourselves to the uttermost, to make all possible efforts. God, for the most part, "helps those who help themselves." But there are occasions when we can do nothing--when all must be left to Him. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-17.htm" title="You shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand you still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the LORD will be with you.">2Chronicles 20:17</a>.) Under these circumstances, our duty and our true wisdom is to wait patiently, quietly, courageously. Moses, probably, did not yet know how God would effect Israel's deliverance, but he was confident that, in one way or another, it would be effected.<p><span class= "bld">The Egyptians whom ye have seen . . . --</span>Heb., <span class= "ital">As ye have seen the Egyptians to-day, ye shall see them no more for ever: i.e.,</span> never again shall ye see them in the pride of power, haughty, menacing, terrible. When next you behold them they will be stiff and lifeless--pale corpses strewing the Red Sea shore (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-30.htm" title="Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the sea shore.">Exodus 14:30</a>). The reference is to the present time only, not to the future relations of the two peoples.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Moses said... fear ye not</span>. Moses knew that the pursuit of Israel by the host of the Egyptians was a part of the counsel of God, and was to tend in some way or other to the promotion of God's honour and glory (ver. 4). He had sufficient faith to believe in a deliverance the nature of which it is not likely that he could anyway conjecture. Whether hail would fall from heaven and destroy them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>); or the earth gape and swallow them up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-32.htm">Numbers 16:32</a>); or the angel of death smite them all in the night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>); or any other strange form of destruction come upon them, he did not know; but he concluded from what had been revealed to him, that God was about to vindicate his own honour without the aid of man. Hence his words - <span class="cmt_word">Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord</span> - which assigned to the Israelites a mere passive attitude of expectation. <span class="cmt_word">For the Egyptians</span>, etc. The order of the words in the original favours the marginal rendering, which is to be adopted with one slight change. Translate - "For, as ye have seen the Egyptians to-day, ye shall see them again no more for ever," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, ye shall see them no more alive, vigorous and menacing, but still and lifeless upon the Red Sea shore (ver. 30). There is no reference to any other Egyptians than those with Pharaoh in the camp, nor to any later relations between Egypt and the chosen people. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:10-14 There was no way open to Israel but upward, and thence their deliverance came. We may be in the way of duty, following God, and hastening toward heaven, yet may be troubled on every side. Some cried out unto the Lord; their fear led them to pray, and that was well. God brings us into straits, that he may bring us to our knees. Others cried out against Moses; fear set them murmuring as if God were not still able to work miracles. They quarrel with Moses for bringing them out of Egypt; and so were angry with God for the greatest kindness ever done them; thus gross are the absurdities of unbelief. Moses says, Fear ye not. It is always our duty and interest, when we cannot get out of troubles, yet to get above our fears; let them quicken our prayers and endeavours, but not silence our faith and hope. Stand still, think not to save yourselves either by fighting or flying; wait God's orders, and observe them. Compose yourselves, by confidence in God, into peaceful thoughts of the great salvation God is about to work for you. If God brings his people into straits, he will find a way to bring them out.</body></html>
