God made answer that it was not a time to cry, but to act: "Speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward," &c. The Israelites were to strike their tents at once, and prepare for a forward movement. Moses was to descend to the edge of the sea, with his rod in his hand, and to stretch it out over the sea, and then await the consequences, which would be a "division" of the waters--the sea-bed would for a certain space become dry, and Israel would be able to cross to the other side (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-16.htm" title="But lift you up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the middle of the sea.">Exodus 14:16</a>); the Egyptians would follow, and then destruction would come upon them, and God would "get himself honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/14-17.htm" title="And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honor on Pharaoh, and on all his host, on his chariots, and on his horsemen.">Exodus 14:17-18</a>). The exact mode of the destruction was not announced.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-18.</span> - GOD'S ANSWER TO MOSES' PRAYER. To the faithful prayer of Moses, albeit pitched perhaps in too low a key, God made gracious answer. A "cry" had been unnecessary, since his word was already pledged to bring his people safe to Canaan, and to get himself honour upon Pharaoh in connection with the pursuit (ver. 4). But, as the appeal has been made, he responds with a plain statement of what has now to be done: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The Israelites are to make themselves ready for a forward movement (ver. 15); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Moses is to stretch oat his rod over the Red Sea, and it will be divided; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The Israelites are then to make the passage on dry ground; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The Egyptians are to follow, and then honour is to be gotten upon them; and they are to know by the result that God is indeed Jehovah. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15, 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore criest thou to me?</span> It is evident that Moses, while boldly encouraging the people, himself needed the support and consolation of prayer. The Syriac translator shows us that he divined the fact aright, when he without authority intruded the words, "Moses then cried to Jehovah." The form of the Divine reply to his prayer seems to indicate a certain amount of reproach, as if Moses himself had become unduly anxious. <span class="cmt_word">Speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward</span>. The Israelites were not to rest in their encampment, but to form in line of march, and descend to the very shore of the sea, and there hold themselves in readiness. Moses was to lift up his rod - the rod with which his other miracles had been wrought - and stretch out his hand over the sea, and then the drying up was to begin. Thus was most of the night passed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:15-20 Moses' silent prayers of faith prevailed more with God than Israel's loud outcries of fear. The pillar of cloud and fire came behind them, where they needed a guard, and it was a wall between them and their enemies. The word and providence of God have a black and dark side toward sin and sinners, but a bright and pleasant side toward the people of the Lord. He, who divided between light and darkness, Ge 1:4, allotted darkness to the Egyptians, and light to the Israelites. Such a difference there will be between the inheritance of the saints in light, and that utter darkness which will be the portion of hypocrites for ever.</body></html>
