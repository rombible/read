Diodorus Siculus gives his Sesostris 24,000 cavalry to 27,000 chariots (Book i. 54, ? 4). Shishak invaded Judaea with 60,000 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-3.htm" title="With twelve hundred chariots, and three score thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.">2Chronicles 12:3</a>). Herodotus makes Amasis lead an army on horseback (ii. 162). The Egyptian monuments appear to make frequent mention of cavalry as forming a portion of the armed force. (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past,</span> vol. ii., pp. 68, 70, 72, 83, &c, vol. iv., 41, 44, 45, &c.) It is suspected that some conventional rules of art prevented the representation of cavalry in the sculptures, which never show us an Egyptian, and but rarely a foreigner, on horseback.<p><span class= "bld">And his army</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., his infantry.</span> The host of this Pharaoh, like that of Shishak (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-3.htm" title="With twelve hundred chariots, and three score thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.">2Chronicles 12:3</a>), consisted apparently of the three arms, cavalry infantry, and chariots.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the horses and chariots of Pharaoh</span> Rather, "all the chariot horses." There is no "and" in the original. <span class="cmt_word">His horsemen</span>. Rather "his riders," or "mounted men " - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, those who rode in the chariots. That the Egyptians had a powerful cavalry at a later date appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>; but the Hebrew text of Exodus, in remarkable accordance with the native monuments of the time, represents the army of this Pharaoh as composed of two descriptions of troops only - a chariot and an infantry force. (See Hengstenberg, <span class="accented">Aegypten und Mose</span>, pp. 127-9). <span class="cmt_word">Overtook them</span>. It is uncertain how long the Israelites remained encamped at Pi-hahiroth. They would wait so long as the pillar of the cloud did not move (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/9-18.htm">Numbers 9:18-20</a>). It must have taken Pharaoh a day to hear of their march from Etham, at least another day to collect his troops, and three or four days to effect the march from Tanis to Pi-hahiroth. The Jewish tradition that the Red Sea was crossed on the night of the 21st of Nisan (Abib) is therefore, conceivably, a true one. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 14:10-14 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-9 Pharaoh would think that all Israel was entangled in the wilderness, and so would become an easy prey. But God says, I will be honoured upon Pharaoh. All men being made for the honour of their Maker, those whom he is not honoured by, he will be honoured upon. What seems to tend to the church's ruin, is often overruled to the ruin of the church's enemies. While Pharaoh gratified his malice and revenge, he furthered the bringing to pass God's counsels concerning him. Though with the greatest reason he had let Israel go, yet now he was angry with himself for it. God makes the envy and rage of men against his people, a torment to themselves. Those who set their faces heavenward, and will live godly in Christ Jesus, must expect to be set upon by Satan's temptations and terrors. He will not tamely part with any out of his service.</body></html>
