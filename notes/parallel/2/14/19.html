The angel is distinguished from the cloud, and represented as antedating its movements and directing them. It is clear that the object of the movement now made was double: (1) to check and trouble the Egyptians by involving them in "cloud and darkness;" and (2) to cheer and assist the Israelites by affording them abundant light for all their necessary arrangements. Although there is nothing in the original corresponding to our translators' expressions, "to them," "to these," yet those expressions seem to do no more than to bring out the true sense.

The Egyptians had arrived in the near neighbourhood of the Israelite camp, at the close of a long day's march, towards evening. Having ascertained that the fugitives were still, as they had expected them to be, shut in between the sea and the wilderness, they were content, and made no immediate attack, but encamped over against them. Hereupon, "the pillar of the cloud," which was at the time in front of the Israelite camp - probably near the point where God intended the passage of the sea to be effected "removed" from this position, and placed itself directly behind the Israelite encampment, between them and the Egyptians. This movement alone was calculated to alarm the latter, and prevent them from stirring till near daybreak; but, the better to secure their inaction, the pillar was made to overshadow them with a deep and preternatural darkness, so that it became almost impossible for them to advance. Meanwhile, on the side which was turned towards the Israelites, the pillar presented the appearance of a bright flame, lighting up the whole encampment, and rendering it as easy to make ready for the march as it would have been by day. Thus, the beasts were collected and laden the columns marshalled and prepared to proceed in a certain fixed order - and everything made ready for starting so soon as the bed of the sea should be sufficiently dry. Moses, about nightfall, descending to the water's edge, stretched forth his rod over the waves, and, an east wind at once springing up - accompanied perhaps by a strong ebb of the tide - the waters of the gulf were parted in the vicinity of the modern Suez, and a dry space left between the Bitter Lakes, which were then a prolongation of the Gulf, and the present sea-bed. The space may have been one of considerable width. The Israelites entering upon it, perhaps about midnight, accomplished the distance, which may not have exceeded a mile, with all their belongings, in the course of five or six hours, the pillar of the cloud withdrawing itself, as the last Israelites entered the sea-bed, and retiring after them like a rearguard. Thus protected, they made the transit in safety, and morning saw them encamped upon the shores of Asia. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The angel of God</span>. The Divine Presence, which manifested itself in the pillar of the cloud, is called indifferently "the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24</a>), and "the Angel of God" - just as the appearance to Moses in the burning bush is termed both "God" and "the angel of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which went before</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>., "which ordinarily, and (so to speak) habitually preceded the camp" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-14.htm">Psalm 78:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And stood behind them</span>.

The pillar of cloud and fire came behind them, where they needed a guard, and it was a wall between them and their enemies. The word and providence of God have a black and dark side toward sin and sinners, but a bright and pleasant side toward the people of the Lord. He, who divided between light and darkness, Ge 1:4, allotted darkness to the Egyptians, and light to the Israelites. Such a difference there will be between the inheritance of the saints in light, and that utter darkness which will be the portion of hypocrites for ever.</body></html>
