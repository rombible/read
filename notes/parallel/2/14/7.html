Diodorus Siculus assigns to his Sesostris (probably Rameses II.) a force of 27,000 chariots; but this is, no doubt, an exaggeration. The largest number of chariots brought together on any one occasion that is <span class= "ital">sufficiently attested,</span> is believed by the present writer to be 3,940, which were collected by various confederates against an Assyrian king (<span class= "ital">Ancient Monarchies,</span> vol. ii, p. 103, Note). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-5.htm" title="And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.">1Samuel 13:5</a>, 30,000 chariots are mentioned, no doubt by some numerical error. A force of 2,500 is said by Rameses II. to have been brought against him in his great Hittite campaign (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past,</span> vol. ii., pp. 69, 71). Sheshonk I. (Shishak) invaded Judaea with 1,200 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-3.htm" title="With twelve hundred chariots, and three score thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.">2Chronicles 12:3</a>). The "six hundred <span class= "ital">chosen</span> chariots" of the present passage are thus quite within the limits of probability. Most likely they constituted a division of the royal guard, and were thus always at the king's disposal.<p><span class= "bld">And all the chariots of Egypt.</span>--The word "all" must not be pressed. The writer means "all that were available--that could be readily summoned." These could only be the chariots of Lower Egypt--those stationed at Memphis, Heliopolis, Bubastis, Pithom, Sebennytus perhaps, and Pelusium. They would probably amount to several hundreds.<p><span class= "bld">Captains over every one of them.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">over the whole of them.</span> These "captains" are again mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-4.htm" title="Pharaoh's chariots and his host has he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.">Exodus 15:4</a>. The word in the original--a derivative from the numeral three--is supposed to have meant, primarily, "persons occupying the third rank below the king."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Six hundred chosen chariots</span>. Diodorus Siculus assigns to one Egyptian king a force of 27,000 chariots (1. 54, &sect; 4), which however is probably beyond the truth. But the 1200 assigned to Shishak (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>) may well be regarded as historical; and the great kings of the nineteenth dynasty would possess at least an equal number. The "six hundred chosen chariots" set in motion on this occasion probably constituted a division of the royal body-guard (Herod. 2:168). The remaining force would be collected from the neighbouring cities of Northern Egypt, as Memphis, Heliopolis, Bubastis, Pithom, and Pelusium. <span class="cmt_word">Captains over every one of them</span>. Rather, "Captains over the whole of them." So the LXX. the Vulgate and Syriac version. Some, however, understand "warriors in each of them ' (Gesenius, Bodiger, Kalisch). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-9 Pharaoh would think that all Israel was entangled in the wilderness, and so would become an easy prey. But God says, I will be honoured upon Pharaoh. All men being made for the honour of their Maker, those whom he is not honoured by, he will be honoured upon. What seems to tend to the church's ruin, is often overruled to the ruin of the church's enemies. While Pharaoh gratified his malice and revenge, he furthered the bringing to pass God's counsels concerning him. Though with the greatest reason he had let Israel go, yet now he was angry with himself for it. God makes the envy and rage of men against his people, a torment to themselves. Those who set their faces heavenward, and will live godly in Christ Jesus, must expect to be set upon by Satan's temptations and terrors. He will not tamely part with any out of his service.</body></html>
