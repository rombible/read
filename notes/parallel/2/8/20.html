In the original it is called the plague of "the '<span class= "ital">ar�b."</span> which is used throughout in the singular number. The LXX. translate <span class= "ital">ha-'arob</span> by "the dog-fly" (<span class= "greekheb">? ????????</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The Jewish commentators connect the word with the root 'ereb or <span class= "ital">'arab,</span> and suppose it to designate either a mixed multitude of all kinds of wild beasts (Josephus and Jonathan), or a mixture of all sorts of insects (Aquila, &c). Moderns generally agree with the LXX. that a definite species of animal--probably an insect--is meant, but doubt about the particular creature. The dog-fly, it is said <span class= "ital">(Musca canina),</span> is not a pest in houses, as the '<span class= "ital">arob</span> was (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-21.htm" title="Else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you, and on your servants, and on your people, and into your houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground where on they are.">Exodus 8:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-24.htm" title="And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.">Exodus 8:24</a>), nor does it do any damage to the land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-24.htm" title="And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.">Exodus 8:24</a>). It is therefore suggested that the plague was really one of the kakerlaque, a kind of beetle, which is injurious both to the persons of men, to the furniture and fittings of houses, and to the crops in the fields. It is in favour of the kakerlaque that, like all beetles, it was sacred, and might not be destroyed, being emblematic of the sun-god, Ra, especially in his form of Khepra, or "the creator." Egyptians were obliged to submit to such a plague without attempting to diminish it, and would naturally view the infliction as a sign that the sun-god was angry with them. They would also suffer grievously in person, for the kakerlaque "inflicts very painful bites with its jaws" (Kalisch); and they would begin for the first time to suffer in their property, which neither the frogs nor the mosquitoes had damaged. The plague was thus--if one of the kakerlaque--an advance on previous plagues, and if less disgusting than some others, was far more injurious.<p>(20) <span class= "bld">Early in the morning.--</span>Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-15.htm" title="Get you to Pharaoh in the morning; see, he goes out to the water; and you shall stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shall you take in your hand.">Exodus 7:15</a>; and on the early habits of an Egyptian king, see Herod. ii. 172.<p><span class= "bld">He cometh forth to the water.</span>--It is conjectured that this was on the occasion of the great autumn festival, when, after the retirement of the Nile within its banks, and the scattering of the grain upon the fresh deposit of mud, the first blades of corn began to appear. It is not improbable that Khepra, "the creator," was then especially worshipped.<p>(21) <span class= "bld">Swarms of flies.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">the 'arob.</span> Comp. <span class= "ital">"</span>the frog<span class= "ital">"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-13.htm" title="And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.">Exodus 8:13</a>), and "the mosquito" (<span class= "ital">ha-kinnim</span>) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-17.htm" title="And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.">Exodus 8:17</a>. On the species intended, sec the comment on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/8-20.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; see, he comes forth to the water; and say to him, Thus said the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.">Exodus 8:20-21</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-24.</span> - It has been noticed that - setting apart the last and most terrible of the plagues, which stands as it were by itself - the remainder divide themselves into three groups of three each - two in each group coming with a warning, and the third without. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-16.htm">Exodus 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-8.htm">Exodus 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21</a>.) In other respects, no great regularity is observable. There is a general principle of increasing severity in the afflictions, but it does not obtain throughout the entire series. The first three caused annoyance, rather than actual injury, either to persons or property. Of the next three, two were upon property, one upon both property and person (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-10.htm">Exodus 9:10</a>). Of the remaining three, two again inflicted injury on property, while one (the plague of darkness) was a mere personal annoyance. The exact character of the fourth plague depends on the proper translation of the word <span class="accented">arob. The</span> Jewish commentators connected this word with <span class="accented">Ereb and 'Arab</span>, words meaning "mingled" or "mixed;" and supposed a mixed multitude of animals - beasts, reptiles, and insects - to be meant. But the expression used throughout, which is <span class="accented">ha-'arob</span>, "the <span class="accented">arob</span>," marks very clearly a single definite species. So much was clear to the LXX., who rendered the word by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, "the dog-fly," which is not the common house-fly (M<span class="accented">usca domestica</span>), but a distinct species (<span class="accented">Musca canina</span>). Flies of this kind are said to constitute a terrible affliction in Egypt (Philo, De <span class="accented">vit</span>. Mos. 2. p. 101; Munk, <span class="accented">Palestine</span>, p. 120; etc.); but they attack men chiefly, and do no harm to houses or to the fruits of the field, whereas the '<span class="accented">arob</span> is spoken of as a pest in the houses, and as "destroying the land" (verse 24). It has been, therefore, suggested that the <span class="accented">Blatta orientalis</span>, or kakerlaque, a kind of beetle, is really intended. These creatures suddenly appear upon the Nile in great numbers; they "inflict very painful bites with their jaws; gnaw and destroy clothes, household furniture, leather, and articles of every kind, and either consume or render unavailable all eatables"(Kalisch). They sometimes drive persons out of their houses; and they also devastate the fields. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lo, he cometh forth to the water</span>. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-15.htm">Exodus 7:15</a>, and comment. It is suspected that on this occasion Pharaoh "went to the Nile with a procession to open the solemn festival "held in the autumn when the inundation was beginning to abate (Cook). <span class="cmt_word">Say unto him</span>. Repeat, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the Divine command so often given (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-1.htm">Exodus 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-16.htm">Exodus 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-1.htm">Exodus 8:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:20-32 Pharaoh was early at his false devotions to the river; and shall we be for more sleep and more slumber, when any service to the Lord is to be done? The Egyptians and the Hebrews were to be marked in the plague of flies. The Lord knows them that are his, and will make it appear, perhaps in this world, certainly in the other, that he has set them apart for himself. Pharaoh unwillingly entered into a treaty with Moses and Aaron. He is content they should sacrifice to their God, provided they would do it in the land of Egypt. But it would be an abomination to God, should they offer the Egyptian sacrifices; and it would be an abomination to the Egyptians, should they offer to God the objects of the worship of the Egyptians, namely, their calves or oxen. Those who would offer acceptable sacrifice to God, must separate themselves from the wicked and profane. They must also retire from the world. Israel cannot keep the feast of the Lord, either among the brick-kilns or among the flesh-pots of Egypt. And they must sacrifice as God shall command, not otherwise. Though they were in slavery to Pharaoh, yet they must obey God's commands. Pharaoh consents for them to go into the wilderness, provided they do not go so far but that he might fetch them back again. Thus, some sinners, in a pang of conviction, part with their sins, yet are loth they should go very far away; for when the fright is over, they will turn to them again. Moses promised the removal of this plague. But let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more. Be not deceived; God is not mocked: if we think to cheat God by a sham repentance and a false surrender of ourselves to him, we shall put a fatal cheat upon our own souls. Pharaoh returned to his hardness. Reigning lusts break through the strongest bonds, and make men presume and go from their word. Many seem in earnest, but there is some reserve, some beloved, secret sin. They are unwilling to look upon themselves as in danger of everlasting misery. They will refrain from other sins; they do much, give much, and even punish themselves much. They will leave it off sometimes, and, as it were, let their sin depart a little way; but will not make up their minds to part with all and follow Christ, bearing the cross. Rather than that, they venture all. They are sorrowful, but depart from Christ, determined to keep the world at present, and they hope for some future season, when salvation may be had without such costly sacrifices; but, at length, the poor sinner is driven away in his wickedness, and left without hope to lament his folly.</body></html>
