Pharaoh had borne the infliction of the water turned to blood without flinching, probably because individually he had suffered but little from it. (See the comment on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-23.htm" title="And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.">Exodus 7:23</a>.) But he suffered from the frogs as much as any one else (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/8-3.htm" title="And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into your house, and into your bedchamber, and on your bed, and into the house of your servants, and on your people, and into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs:">Exodus 8:3-4</a>); and the personal inconvenience drove him to make a concession. As far as words could go, the concession was complete. (1) He acknowledged the power of Jehovah ("Intreat the Lord, that <span class= "ital">He</span> may take away, &c."'); (2) he acknowledged the power of righteous men's prayers; (3) he made an absolute unreserved promise to "let the people go."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-15.</span> - How long the plague of frogs endured, we are not told. Probably every effort was made, short of intentionally killing them, to get rid of them. Snakes, and chameleons, and ibises would destroy many - others would be crushed beneath wheels, trampled on by animals, squeezed to death by the opening of doors, unintentionally killed by men. But the vacancies made were constantly filled; and there seemed no prospect of the infliction passing away. The influence of his counsellors would under these circumstances be brought to bear upon the mind of the Pharaoh - he would be warned that his subjects were attributing their sufferings to his obstinacy - he would be recommended - perhaps pressed - to yield, and would find in the annoyance which he individually endured a strong motive for compliance. Accordingly, he after a while sent for the two Israelite chiefs, and made the request recorded in the text. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Intreat the Lord</span> - <span class="accented">i.e</span>., "Intreat your God, Jehovah, who has sent this plague, and can doubtless take it away." An acknowledgment of Jehovah's power is now for the first time forced from the reluctant king, who has hitherto boasted that "he knew not Jehovah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will let the people go</span>. The royal word is passed. A positive promise is made. If the Pharaoh does not keep his word, he will outrage even Egyptian morality - he will be without excuse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-15 Pharaoh is plagued with frogs; their vast numbers made them sore plagues to the Egyptians. God could have plagued Egypt with lions, or bears, or wolves, or with birds of prey, but he chose to do it by these despicable creatures. God, when he pleases, can arm the smallest parts of the creation against us. He thereby humbled Pharaoh. They should neither eat, nor drink, nor sleep in quiet; but wherever they were, they should be troubled by the frogs. God's curse upon a man will pursue him wherever he goes, and lie heavy upon him whatever he does. Pharaoh gave way under this plague. He promises that he will let the people go. Those who bid defiance to God and prayer, first or last, will be made to see their need of both. But when Pharaoh saw there was respite, he hardened his heart. Till the heart is renewed by the grace of God, the thoughts made by affliction do not abide; the convictions wear off, and the promises that were given are forgotten. Till the state of the air is changed, what thaws in the sun will freeze again in the shade.</body></html>
