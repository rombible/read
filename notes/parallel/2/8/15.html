Literally, "a taking of breath," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "a breathing-space." <span class="cmt_word">He hardened his heart</span>. He became hard and merciless once more, believing that the danger was past, and not expecting any fresh visitation. As Isaiah says - "Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-10.htm">Isaiah 26:10</a>). Bad men "despise the riches of God's goodness and forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth them to repentance." In this way, they "treasure up to themselves wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4, 5</a>), either in this world or in the world to come. <span class="cmt_word">As the Lord had said</span>.

CHAPTER 8:16-19 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-15 Pharaoh is plagued with frogs; their vast numbers made them sore plagues to the Egyptians. God could have plagued Egypt with lions, or bears, or wolves, or with birds of prey, but he chose to do it by these despicable creatures. God, when he pleases, can arm the smallest parts of the creation against us. He thereby humbled Pharaoh. They should neither eat, nor drink, nor sleep in quiet; but wherever they were, they should be troubled by the frogs. God's curse upon a man will pursue him wherever he goes, and lie heavy upon him whatever he does. Pharaoh gave way under this plague. He promises that he will let the people go. Those who bid defiance to God and prayer, first or last, will be made to see their need of both. But when Pharaoh saw there was respite, he hardened his heart. Till the heart is renewed by the grace of God, the thoughts made by affliction do not abide; the convictions wear off, and the promises that were given are forgotten. Till the state of the air is changed, what thaws in the sun will freeze again in the shade.</body></html>
