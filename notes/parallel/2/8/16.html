(16, 17)</span><p>It is disputed whether this plague was one of lice or of mosquitoes. Josephus and the Jewish commentators generally take the former view, while the latter is supported by the LXX. and Vulgate, by the authorities of Philo, Artapanus, Origen, and St. Augustine in ancient, and by those of Rosenmller, Michaelis, ?dmann, Gesenius, Keil, and Kalisch in modern times. The word used (<span class= "ital">kinnim</span>) seems connected with the Greek <span class= "greekheb">????</span>, or <span class= "greekheb">?????</span>, and is reasonably regarded as formed by <span class= "ital">onomatopoeia,</span> from the sharp tingling sound given out by the insect when on the wing.<span class= "note">[58]</span> The trouble caused to the Egyptians of the Delta by mosquitoes is noticed by Herodotus (ii. 95); while moderns, as Forskal (<span class= "ital">Descript. Anim.</span> p. 85), declare that they amount to an absolute pest at certain seasons. They are most troublesome towards October, and are said to attack not only the exposed parts of the skin, but especially the ears, the nostrils, and the eyes, where they do great damage. Some have thought that mosquitoes do not molest cattle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-17.htm" title="And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.">Exodus 8:17</a>); but Kalisch says, "They molest <span class= "ital">especially</span> beasts, as oxen and horses, flying into their eyes and nostrils, driving them to madness and fury, and sometimes even torturing them to death."<p><span class= "note">[58] In Egyptian the word for "mosquito" is <span class= "ital">Khnemms,</span> (Brugsch, <span class= "ital">Diet. Hierogl.</span> p. 1103).</span><p>It is to be noticed that the third plague, whatever it was, came without warning. It was God's judgment on Pharaoh for hardening his heart and breaking his promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-15.htm" title="But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and listened not to them; as the LORD had said.">Exodus 8:15</a>); and he was not given the option of avoiding it by submission to God's will.<p>(16) <span class= "bld">Smite the dust of the land.</span>--Dust prevails in Egypt to an extent that is highly inconvenient. "We travelled to Ashmim." says one writer, "through clouds of dust, raised by a high wind, which intercepted our view as much as if we had been travelling in a fog." "There is one great source of discomfort," says another, "arising from the dryness of the atmosphere, namely, an excessive quantity of dust." When "all the dust of the land became mosquitoes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-17.htm" title="And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.">Exodus 8:17</a>), the plague must indeed have been great.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-19.</span> - THE THIRD PLAGUE. The breach of promise on the part of Pharaoh (ver. 15), was punished by the third plague, which was inflicted without being announced. It is disputed among the best critics, whether the plague was really one of "lice"(as given in the Authorised Version) or of mosquitoes. To the present writer the arguments in favour of mosquitoes seem to preponderate; and he believes the <span class="accented">kinnim to</span> represent those subtle pests. Such is the view of the LXX. translators, of Philo, Artapanus, Origen, Rosenmuller, Gesenins, Geddes, Boothroyd, Keil, and Kalisch. Mosquitoes are, under ordinary circumstances, a terrible annoyance in Egypt, when the inundation is going off, especially about October. Their power to annoy is witnessed to in ancient times by Herodotus (2:95), Philo (<span class="accented">Vit. Mos.</span> 2. p. 97), and St. Augustine; in modern by Wilkinson and others. That Aaron was ordered to produce them out of "the dust of the land," whereas mosquitoes come from larvae deposited in stagnant waters (Cook), is only a proof that God can transform any kind of matter into any other. He who made man of the dust of the ground (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>) could with still greater ease have transformed that dust into gnats. It is undoubtedly remarkable that the magi-clans could not produce the <span class="accented">kinnim</span>; but this disability does not help us to determine what exactly the <span class="accented">kinnim</span> were. Conceivably, the magicians were tired of the contest, and feeling that they would ultimately be worsted in it, . withdrew before the circumstances compelled them to withdraw. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lice</span>. <span class="accented">Kinnim - the</span> word is only found here and in the Psalms which celebrate the Exodus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-46.htm">Psalm 78:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-31.htm">Psalm 105:31</a>). It was understood as "lice"by Josephus, the Talmudical writers, Bochart, Pool, and our translators in the reign of James I. But the great weight of authority is in favour of the rendering "<span class="accented">gnats"</span> or "mosquitoes." See the preceding paragraph. It must also be berne in mind that the nearest Egyptian equivalent, <span class="accented">khennems</span>, <span class="accented">has the</span> signification of mosquito (Speaker's <span class="accented">Commentary</span>, vol. 1. p. 490). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:16-19 These lice were produced out of the dust of the earth; out of any part of the creation God can fetch a scourge, with which to correct those who rebel against him. Even the dust of the earth obeys him. These lice were very troublesome, as well as disgraceful to the Egyptians, whose priests were obliged to take much pains that no vermin ever should be found about them. All the plagues inflicted on the Egyptians, had reference to their national crimes, or were rendered particularly severe by their customs. The magicians attempted to imitate it, but they could not. It forced them to confess, This is the finger of God! The check and restraint put upon us, must needs be from a Divine power. Sooner or later God will force even his enemies to acknowledge his own power. Pharaoh, notwithstanding this, was more and more obstinate.</body></html>
