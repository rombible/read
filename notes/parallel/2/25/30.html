The Hebrew expression translated "shewbread" is literally, "bread of face," or "bread of presence"--bread, that is, which was set forth always before the presence of God.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou</span> <span class="cmt_word">shalt set upon the table shew-bread before me alway</span>. Here we have at once the object of the table, and its name, explained. The table was to have set upon it continually twelve loaves, or cakes, of bread (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5</a>), which were to be renewed weekly on the sabbath-day (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 8), the stale loaves being at the same time consumed by the priests in the holy place. These twelve loaves or cakes were to constitute a continual thank-offering to God from the twelve tribes of Israel in return for the bless-Lugs of life and sustenance which they received from him. The bread was called "bread of face," or "bread of presence," because it was set before the "face" or "presence" of God, which dwelt in the holy of holies. The Septuagint renders the phrase by <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> "loaves that are face to face" - St. Matthew by <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, "loaves of setting-forth" - whence the <span class="accented">Schaubrode</span> of Luther, and our "shew-bread," which is a paraphrase rather than a translation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 25:31 THE GOLDEN CANDLESTICK (vers. 31-40). Though the holy of holies was always dark, unless when lighted by. the glory of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34, 35</a>), the holy place, in which many of the priests' functions were to be performed, was to be always kept light. In the day-time sufficient light entered from the porch in front; but, as evening drew on, some artificial illumination was required. In connection with this object, the golden candlestick, or rather lamp-stand, was designed, which, together with its appurtenances, is described in the remainder of the chapter. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:23-30 A table was to be made of wood, overlaid with gold, to stand in the outer tabernacle, to be always furnished with the shew-bread. This table, with the articles on it, and its use, seems to typify the communion which the Lord holds with his redeemed people in his ordinances, the provisions of his house, the feasts they are favoured with. Also the food for their souls, which they always find when they hunger after it; and the delight he takes in their persons and services, as presented before him in Christ.</body></html>
