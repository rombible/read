Herodotus describes the manufacture of his own times (<span class= "ital">Hist. iv.</span> 189). Even at the present day, we bind our best books in <span class= "ital">morocco. </span>Brilliant colours always were, and still are, affected by the North African races, and their "red skins" have been famous in all ages. It is probable that the Israelites had brought with them many skins of this kind out of Egypt.<p><span class= "bld">Badgers' skins.</span>--The badger is not a native of North Africa, nor of the Arabian desert; and the translation of the Hebrew <span class= "ital">takhash </span>by "badger" is a very improbable conjecture. In Arabic, <span class= "ital">tukhash </span>or <span class= "ital">dukhash </span>is the name of a marine animal resembling the seal; or, perhaps it should rather be said, is applied with some vagueness to a number of sea-animals, as seals, dugongs, dolphins, sharks, and dog-fish. The skins here spoken of are probably those of some one or more of these animals. They formed the outer covering of the Tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-14.htm" title="And you shall make a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering above of badgers' skins.">Exodus 26:14</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Shittim wood.</span>--That the <span class= "ital">shittah </span>(plural, <span class= "ital">shittim</span>) was a species of Acacia is now generally admitted.<p>It was certainly not the palm; and there are no trees in the Sinaitic region from which boards could be cut (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-15.htm" title="And you shall make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood standing up.">Exodus 26:15</a>) except the palm and the acacia. The Sinaitic acacia (<span class= "ital">A. Seyal</span>) is a "gnarled and thorny tree, somewhat like a solitary hawthorn in its habit and manner of growth, but much larger" (Tristram). At present it does not, in the Sinaitic region, grow to such <span class= "bld">a </span>size as would admit of planks, ten cubits long by one and a half wide, being cut from it; but, according to Canon Tristram (<span class= "ital">Nat. Hist. Of the Bible, </span>p. 392), it attains such a size in Palestine, and therefore may formerly have done so in Arabia. The wood is "hard and close-grained, of an orange colour with a darker heart, well adapted for cabinetwork."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And rams' skins dyed red</span>. The manufacture of leather was well-known in Egypt from an early date, and the Libyan tribes of North Africa were celebrated for their skill in preparing and dyeing the material (Herod. 4:189). Scarlet was one of the colours which they peculiarly affected (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>). We must suppose that the skins spoken of had been brought with them by the Israelites cut of Egypt. <span class="cmt_word">And badgers' skins</span>. It is generally agreed among moderns that this is a wrong translation. Badgers are found in Palestine, but not either in Egypt or in the wilderness. The Hebrew <span class="accented">takhash</span> is evidently the same word as the Arabic <span class="accented">tukhash</span> or <span class="accented">dukhash</span>, which is applied to marine animals only, as to seals, dolphins, dugongs, and perhaps sharks and dog-fish. "Seals' skins" would perhaps be the best translation. (Compare Plin. <span class="accented">H.</span> <span class="accented">N.</span> 2:55; Sueton. <span class="accented">Octav</span> &sect; 90.) <span class="accented">Shittim wood</span>. It is generally agreed that the Shittah (plural Shittim) was an acacia, whether the seyal (<span class="accented">Acacia seyal</span>) which now grows so abundantly in the Sinaitic peninsula, or the <span class="accented">Acacia Nilotica</span>, or the <span class="accented">Serissa</span>, is uncertain. The seyal wood is "hard and close-grained of an orange colour with a darker heart, well-adapted for cabinet work;" but the tree, as it exists nowadays, could certainly not furnish the planks, ten cubits long by one and a half wide, which were needed for the Tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-21.htm">Exodus 35:21</a>). The <span class="accented">Serissa</span> might do so, but it is not now found in the wilderness. We are reduced to supposing either that the seyal grew to a larger size anciently than at present, or that the serissa was more widely spread than at the present day. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-9 God chose the people of Israel to be a peculiar people to himself, above all people, and he himself would be their King. He ordered a royal palace to be set up among them for himself, called a sanctuary, or holy place, or habitation. There he showed his presence among them. And because in the wilderness they dwelt in tents, this royal palace was ordered to be a tabernacle, that it might move with them. The people were to furnish Moses with the materials, by their own free will. The best use we can make of our worldly wealth, is to honour God with it in works of piety and charity. We should ask, not only, What must we do? but, What may we do for God? Whatever they gave, they must give it cheerfully, not grudgingly, for God loves a cheerful giver, 2Co 9:7. What is laid out in the service of God, we must reckon well bestowed; and whatsoever is done in God's service, must be done by his direction.</body></html>
