The erection of sanctuaries is one of the fittest occasions for man to shew his gratitude to God by giving to Him of His own, largely and liberally.<p><span class= "bld">Of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">of every man whose heart impels him. </span>Unless gifts come from the heart, they are an offence to God. He "loveth a cheerful giver." When the time came, a noble and liberal spirit was not wanting. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/35-21.htm" title="And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD's offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments.">Exodus 35:21-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/36-3.htm" title="And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it with. And they brought yet to him free offerings every morning.">Exodus 36:3-7</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">My offering.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">my heave-offering. </span>But the word seems to be intended in a generic sense.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Speak unto the children of Israel that they bring me an offering</span>. The word translated "offering" is that commonly rendered" heave-offering;" but it seems to be used here (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-5.htm">Exodus 35:5</a>, etc.) in a generic sense. The propriety of the people, when God was about establishing his habitation among them, presenting to God all the materials needed, is self-evident and requires no comment. <span class="cmt_word">Of every man that giveth it willingly</span>. Literally, "of every man whose heart drives him." God will have no gifts but such as are freely offered. He "loveth a cheerful giver. If a man gives grudgingly or of necessity," God rejects the gift. On the noble spirit which the people showed when the appeal was made to them, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-21.htm">Exodus 35:21-29</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/36-3.htm">Exodus 36:3</a>7 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-9 God chose the people of Israel to be a peculiar people to himself, above all people, and he himself would be their King. He ordered a royal palace to be set up among them for himself, called a sanctuary, or holy place, or habitation. There he showed his presence among them. And because in the wilderness they dwelt in tents, this royal palace was ordered to be a tabernacle, that it might move with them. The people were to furnish Moses with the materials, by their own free will. The best use we can make of our worldly wealth, is to honour God with it in works of piety and charity. We should ask, not only, What must we do? but, What may we do for God? Whatever they gave, they must give it cheerfully, not grudgingly, for God loves a cheerful giver, 2Co 9:7. What is laid out in the service of God, we must reckon well bestowed; and whatsoever is done in God's service, must be done by his direction.</body></html>
