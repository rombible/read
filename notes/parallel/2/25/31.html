It was composed of a straight stem, rising perpendicularly from a base, and having on either side of it three curved arms or branches, all of them in the same plane, and all rising to the same level. The stem and arms were ornamented with representations of almond flowers, pomegranates, and lily blossoms, repeated as there was room for them, the top ornament being in every case a lily blossom, which held a hemispherical lamp. The form and ornamentation of the base are unknown, since the representation of the base upon the Arch of Titus is manifestly from some Roman work which had superseded the original pedestal. The special object of the candlestick seems to have been to give light by night. Its lamps were to be lighted at even (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-8.htm" title="And when Aaron lights the lamps at even, he shall burn incense on it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations.">Exodus 30:8</a>) by the High Priest, and were to burn from evening to morning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-21.htm" title="In the tabernacle of the congregation without the veil, which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it from evening to morning before the LORD: it shall be a statute for ever to their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel.">Exodus 27:21</a>), when they were to be <span class= "ital">"</span>dressed," or trimmed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-7.htm" title="And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresses the lamps, he shall burn incense on it.">Exodus 30:7</a>), and "extinguished" (Kalisch, <span class= "ital">Comment, on Exodus, </span>p. 370). The Holy Place had sufficient light during the day from the entrance, where the curtain would let the light through, if indeed it were not also partially looped up.<p>(31) <span class= "bld">Of beaten work.</span>--Like the cherubim. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-18.htm" title="And you shall make two cherubim of gold, of beaten work shall you make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.">Exodus 25:18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">His bowls, his knops, and his flowers.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">its cups, its pomegranates, and its blossoms. </span>The "cups<span class= "ital">" </span>are afterwards said to be "like almonds" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-33.htm" title="Three bowls made like to almonds, with a bud and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, with a bud and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick.">Exodus 25:33</a>), <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>almond blossoms.<p><span class= "bld">Shall be of the same</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., "</span>of one piece with the stem and branches;" not separate ornaments put together.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A candlestick</span>. The golden candlestick is figured upon the Arch of Titus, and appears by that representation to have consisted of an upright shaft, from which three curved branches were carried out on either side, all of them in the same plane. It stands there on an octagonal pedestal, in two stages, ornamented with figures of birds and sea-monsters. This pedestal is, however, clearly Roman work, and no part of the original. <span class="cmt_word">Of beaten work</span>. Not cast, but fashioned by the hand, like the cherubim (ver. 18). <span class="cmt_word">His shaft</span>. Rather, "its base" (literally "flank"). <span class="cmt_word">His branches</span>. Our version follows the Septuagint; but the Hebrew noun is in the singular number, and seems to designate the upright stem, or shaft. The "branches are not mentioned till ver. 32, where the same noun is used in the plural. <span class="cmt_word">His bowls, his knops, and his flowers</span>. Rather, "its cups, its pomegranates, and its lilies." The "cups" are afterwards likened to almond flowers (ver. 33); they formed the first ornament on each branch; above them was a representation of the pomegranate fruit; above this a lily blossom. The lily-blossoms supported the lamps, which were separate (ver. 37). The remainder were of one piece with the candlestick. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:31-40 The candlestick represents the light of God's word and Spirit, in and through Christ Jesus, afforded in this dark world to his believing people, to direct their worship and obedience, and to afford them consolations. The church is still dark, as the tabernacle was, in comparison with what it will be in heaven; but the word of God is a light shining in a dark place,</body></html>
