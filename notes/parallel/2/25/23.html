When this had been shown to Moses the next thing to be done was to set before him the furniture of the outer sanctuary, or holy place. This consisted of three articles--(1) The table of shewbread, described in the present passage; (2) the golden candlestick, described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/25-31.htm" title="And you shall make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.">Exodus 25:31-40</a>; and (3) the altar of incense, described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/30-1.htm" title="And you shall make an altar to burn incense on: of shittim wood shall you make it.">Exodus 30:1-10</a>. The "table of shewbread" was a receptacle for the twelve loaves, which were to be "set continually before the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-8.htm" title="Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.">Leviticus 24:8</a>) as a thank-offering on the part of His people--a perpetual acknowledgment of His perpetual protection and favour. It was to be just large enough to contain the twelve loaves, set in two rows, being a yard long, and a foot and a-half broad. The vessels belonging to the table (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-29.htm" title="And you shall make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover with: of pure gold shall you make them.">Exodus 25:29</a>) were not placed on it.<p>(23) <span class= "bld">Of shittim wood.</span>--See the last Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-5.htm" title="And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,">Exodus 25:5</a>. No other wood was to be employed, either for the sanctuary itself, or for its furniture.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-30.</span> - THE TABLE OF SHEW-BREAD. From the description of the ark, which constituted the sole furniture of the most holy place, God proceeded to describe the furniture of the holy place, or body of the tabernacle, which was to consist of three objects - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> A table, called the table of shew-bread ("bread of presence" or "bread of setting-forth"). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> A candelabrum, or lamp-stand; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> An altar for the offering of incense. Of these the table seems to have been regarded as of primary importance; and its description is therefore made to follow immediately on that of the ark. It was of acacia wood, overlaid with pure gold, and was of the most ordinary shape - oblong-square, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, with four legs, one at each corner. The only peculiar features of the table, besides its material, were the border, or edging, which surrounded it at the top, the framework which strengthened the legs (ver. 25), and the rings by which it was to be carried from place to place. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Two cubits shall be the length thereof,</span> etc. The table was to be three feel long, one foot six inches broad, and two feet three inches high. It was thus quite a small table, narrow for its length, and about two inches below the ordinary height. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:23-30 A table was to be made of wood, overlaid with gold, to stand in the outer tabernacle, to be always furnished with the shew-bread. This table, with the articles on it, and its use, seems to typify the communion which the Lord holds with his redeemed people in his ordinances, the provisions of his house, the feasts they are favoured with. Also the food for their souls, which they always find when they hunger after it; and the delight he takes in their persons and services, as presented before him in Christ.</body></html>
