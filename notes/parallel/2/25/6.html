Oil therefore is to be provided for the lighting.

We find afterwards that the Tabernacle itself, all its vessels, and the priests appointed to serve in it, had to be consecrated by anointing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-7.htm" title="Then shall you take the anointing oil, and pour it on his head, and anoint him.">Exodus 29:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-36.htm" title="And you shall offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement: and you shall cleanse the altar, when you have made an atonement for it, and you shall anoint it, to sanctify it.">Exodus 29:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/30-26.htm" title="And you shall anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony,">Exodus 30:26-30</a>). The particular spices to be mixed with the "anointing oil" are enumerated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/30-23.htm" title="Take you also to you principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,">Exodus 30:23-24</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And for sweet incense.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">for the sweet incense--the </span>incense, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>which would have to be burnt.

That the sanctuary to be erected would require to be artificially lighted is assumed. Later, a "candlestick" is ordered (vers. 31-37). The people were to provide the oil which was to be burnt in the "candlestick." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-20.htm">Exodus 27:20</a>, we are told that the oil was to be "pure oil olive beaten." <span class="cmt_word">Spices for anointing oil.</span> Anointing oil would be needed for the sanctification of the Tabernacle, the ark, and all the holy vessels, as also for the consecration of Aaron and his sons to the priesthood. The spices required are enumerated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23, 24</a>. They consisted of pure myrrh, sweet cinnamon, sweet calamus, and cassia. <span class="cmt_word">And for sweet incense</span>. The spices needed for the incense were, according to our translators, stacte, onycha, galbanum and frankincense (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 34). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-9 God chose the people of Israel to be a peculiar people to himself, above all people, and he himself would be their King. He ordered a royal palace to be set up among them for himself, called a sanctuary, or holy place, or habitation. There he showed his presence among them. And because in the wilderness they dwelt in tents, this royal palace was ordered to be a tabernacle, that it might move with them. The people were to furnish Moses with the materials, by their own free will. The best use we can make of our worldly wealth, is to honour God with it in works of piety and charity. We should ask, not only, What must we do? but, What may we do for God? Whatever they gave, they must give it cheerfully, not grudgingly, for God loves a cheerful giver, 2Co 9:7. What is laid out in the service of God, we must reckon well bestowed; and whatsoever is done in God's service, must be done by his direction.</body></html>
