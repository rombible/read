Linen yarn of the three colours mentioned seems to have been what the people were asked to furnish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-25.htm" title="And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.">Exodus 35:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-1.htm" title="And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.">Exodus 39:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Fine linen</span>--i.e., white thread spun from flax, which is found to be the material of almost all the Egyptian dresses, mummy cloths, and other undyed fabrics. It is of a yellowish white, soft, and wonderfully fine and delicate. (See Wilkinson in Rawlinson's <span class= "ital">Herodotus, </span>vol. ii., p. 233).<p><span class= "bld">Goats' hair.</span>--The covering of an Arab tent is to this day almost always of goats'-hair. An excellent fabric is woven from the soft inner hair of the Syrian goat, and a coarse one from the outer coat of the animal. Yarn of goats'-hair was to be offered, that from it might be produced the first of the three outer coverings of the Tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/26-7.htm" title="And you shall make curtains of goats' hair to be a covering on the tabernacle: eleven curtains shall you make.">Exodus 26:7-14</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And blue, and purple, and scarlet</span>. Cloths of these three colours seem to be meant. The material was probably wool; the blue dye probably indigo, which was the ordinary blue dye of Egypt; the purple was no doubt derived from one or other of the shell-fish so well-known to the Syrians (of which the one most used was <span class="accented">the Murex trunculus</span>), and was of a warm reddish hue, not far from crimson; the scarlet (literally, "scarlet <span class="accented">worm"</span> or "<span class="accented">worm</span> scarlet,") was the produce of the <span class="accented">Corcus ilicis</span>, or cochineal insect of the holm oak, which has now been superseded by the <span class="accented">Coccus cacti</span>, or cochineal insect of the prickly pear, introduced into Europe from Mexico. <span class="cmt_word">And fine linen</span>. The word used is Egyptian. It seems to have designated properly the fine linen spun from flax in Egypt, which was seldom dyed. and was of a beautiful soft white hue. The fineness of the material is extraordinary, equalling that of the best Indian muslins (Wilkinson's <span class="accented">Ancient</span> <span class="accented">Egyptians</span>, vol. 3. p. 121). It would seem that the Israelite women spun the thread from the flax (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-25.htm">Exodus 35:25</a>), and that the skilled workmen employed by Moses wove the thread into linen (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 35). <span class="cmt_word">And goat's hair</span>. The soft inner wool of the Angora goat was also spun by the women into a fine worsted (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 26), which was woven into cloths, used especially as coverings for tents. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-9 God chose the people of Israel to be a peculiar people to himself, above all people, and he himself would be their King. He ordered a royal palace to be set up among them for himself, called a sanctuary, or holy place, or habitation. There he showed his presence among them. And because in the wilderness they dwelt in tents, this royal palace was ordered to be a tabernacle, that it might move with them. The people were to furnish Moses with the materials, by their own free will. The best use we can make of our worldly wealth, is to honour God with it in works of piety and charity. We should ask, not only, What must we do? but, What may we do for God? Whatever they gave, they must give it cheerfully, not grudgingly, for God loves a cheerful giver, 2Co 9:7. What is laid out in the service of God, we must reckon well bestowed; and whatsoever is done in God's service, must be done by his direction.</body></html>
