rooms shall you make in the ark, and shall pitch it within and without with pitch.">Genesis 6:14</a>); but <span class= "ital">kipper, </span>the Piel form of the same verb, has never any other meaning than that of "covering," or "expiating <span class= "ital">sins." </span>And <span class= "ital">kapporeth </span>is not formed from <span class= "ital">kaphar, </span>but from <span class= "ital">kipper. </span>Hence the <span class= "greekheb">??????????</span> of the LXX., the <span class= "ital">propitiatorium </span>of the Vulg., and the "mercy seat" of the Authorised Version are correct translations. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm" title="Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlors thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,">1Chronicles 28:11</a>, where the Holy of Holies is called <span class= "ital">beyth-hak-kapporeth, </span>which is certainly not" the house of the cover,' but "the house of expiation.")<p><span class= "bld">Of pure gold.</span>--Not of shittim wood, overlaid with a plating of gold, but a solid mass of the pure metal. It has been calculated that the weight would be 750 lbs. Troy, and the value above 25,000 of our money. It was intended to show by this lavish outlay, that the "mercy seat" was that object in which the accessories of worship culminated, the crowning glory of the material tabernacle.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt make a mercy seat.</span> Modern exegesis has endeavoured to empty the word <span class="accented">kapporeth</span> of its true meaning, witnessed to by the Septuagint, as well as by the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-5.htm">Hebrews 9:5</a>). It tells us that a kapporeth is simply a cover, "being derived from <span class="accented">kaphar</span>, to cover," - used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-14.htm">Genesis 5:14</a>, with respect to covering the ark with pitch. But the truth is that <span class="accented">kapporeth</span> is not derived from <span class="accented">kaphar</span>, but from <span class="accented">kipper</span>, the Piel form of the same verb, which has never any other sense than that of covering, or forgiving sins. In this sense it is used in the Old Testament some seventy times. Whether the mercy seat was the real cover of the ark of the covenant, or whether that had its own lid of acacia wood, as Kalisch supposes, is uncertain. At any rate, it was not called <span class="accented">kipporeth</span> because it was a cover, but because it was a seat of propitiation. On the importance of the mercy seat, as in some sort transcending the ark itself, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11</a>. Atonement was made by sprinkling the blood of expiation upon it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-14.htm">Leviticus 16:14, 15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of pure gold</span>, Not of wood, plated with metal, or richly gilt, but of solid gold - an oblong slab, three feet nine inches long, two feet three inches wide, and probably not less than an inch thick. The weight of such a slab would be above 750 lbs. troy, and its value above 25,000<span class="accented">l</span>. of our money. The length and breadth were exactly those of the ark itself, which the mercy seat thus exactly covered (ver. 10). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:10-22 The ark was a chest, overlaid with gold, in which the two tables of the law were to be kept. These tables are called the testimony; God in them testified his will. This law was a testimony to the Israelites, to direct them in their duty, and would be a testimony against them, if they transgressed. This ark was placed in the holy of holies; the blood of the sacrifices was sprinkled, and the incense burned, before it, by the high priest; and above it appeared the visible glory, which was the symbol of the Divine presence. This was a type of Christ in his sinless nature, which saw no corruption, in personal union with his Divine nature, atoning for our sins against it, by his death. The cherubim of gold looked one towards another, and both looked downward toward the ark. It denotes the angels' attendance on the Redeemer, their readiness to do his will, their presence in the assemblies of saints, and their desire to look into the mysteries of the gospel. It was covered with a covering of gold, called the mercy-seat. God is said to dwell, or sit between the cherubim, on the mercy-seat. There he would give his law, and hear supplicants, as a prince on his throne.</body></html>
