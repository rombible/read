They had added to their wealth by the plunder of the Amalekites. Thus they possessed a considerable store of the precious metals; and there is no difficulty in supposing that they furnished the gold needed for the tabernacle without seriously impoverishing themselves. The silver, which was of small amount comparatively, appears ultimately to have been furnished in another way (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/30-12.htm" title="When you take the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul to the LORD, when you number them; that there be no plague among them, when you number them.">Exodus 30:12-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/38-25.htm" title="And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and three score and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:">Exodus 38:25-28</a>) The brass, or rather bronze, for brass seems to have been unknown at this time, was small in amount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-29.htm" title="And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels.">Exodus 38:29</a>), and of no great value. It would have constituted no serious drain on the resources of the people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is the offering - gold and silver and brass</span>. Gold was needed for the overlaying of the boards, whereof the ark was composed (ver. 11); for the "crown of gold," which surmounted it (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>); for the "rings" (ver. 12); the "mercy-seat" (ver. 17) - the cherubim (ver. 18); the dishes, the spoons, the covers, the bowls (ver. 29); the candlestick (ver. 31); the tongs and snuff dishes (ver. 28); the hooks and taches (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-6.htm">Exodus 26:6, 32</a>); for the covering of the table of shew bread (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-24.htm">Exodus 25:24</a>); and of the staves and pillars (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 28: <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-32.htm">Exodus 26:32, 37</a>); and also for many parts of the dress of the High Priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-6.htm">Exodus 28:6, 8, 11, 14</a>, etc.). Silver was required for the sockets which supported the hoards of the Tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-19.htm">Exodus 26:19</a>); and for the "hooks" and "fillets" of the pillars of the court (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-10.htm">Exodus 27:10</a>) Brass, or rather bronze, was wanted for the "taches" which coupled together the curtains of the tent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-11.htm">Exodus 26:11</a>); for the "sockets" which received the pillars or tent-poles (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 37); for the external coating of the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-2.htm">Exodus 27:2</a>); for the vessels and utensils of the altar (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 3); for the covering of its staves (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 6); for the sockets of the pillars of the Court (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-10.htm">Exodus 27:10</a>); for the "pins" of the Court (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 19); and generally for the vessels of the Tabernacle (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>). To understand how the Israelites could supply all that was wanted, we must remember, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That they had a certain amount of ancestral wealth, as that which Joseph had accumulated, and what Jacob and his sons had brought with them into Egypt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That they had received large presents of gold and silver from the Egyptians just before their departure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That they had recently defeated, and no doubt despoiled, the Amalekites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-8.htm">Exodus 16:8-13</a>). Whether they had further made money by trade since they entered the Sinaitic peninsula, may be doubted. The supposition is not at all needed in order to account for their wealth. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-9 God chose the people of Israel to be a peculiar people to himself, above all people, and he himself would be their King. He ordered a royal palace to be set up among them for himself, called a sanctuary, or holy place, or habitation. There he showed his presence among them. And because in the wilderness they dwelt in tents, this royal palace was ordered to be a tabernacle, that it might move with them. The people were to furnish Moses with the materials, by their own free will. The best use we can make of our worldly wealth, is to honour God with it in works of piety and charity. We should ask, not only, What must we do? but, What may we do for God? Whatever they gave, they must give it cheerfully, not grudgingly, for God loves a cheerful giver, 2Co 9:7. What is laid out in the service of God, we must reckon well bestowed; and whatsoever is done in God's service, must be done by his direction.</body></html>
