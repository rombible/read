The golden pot with manna, or bread from heaven, the flesh of Jesus Christ, which he gave for the life of the world.

The shew-bread represented that provision for those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, which the gospel, the ordinances and the sacraments of the house of prayer, abundantly bestow.
