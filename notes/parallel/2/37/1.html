On the history of the construction of the tabernacle follows naturally that of the construction of its furniture. The order of dignity is followed, as in ch. 25, and the furniture of the holy of holies taken first. Vers. 1-9 correspond to vers. 10-20 of ch. 25; vers. 10-16 to vers. 23-29; vers. 17-24 to vers. 31-39 of the same; and vers. 25-28 to vers. 1-5 of ch. 30. Ver. 29 is an abbreviation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23-25</a>, and 34, 35. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bezaleel made the ark</span>. The particular maker of the various parts and contents of the tabernacle is not elsewhere pointed out. Thus this mention of Bezaleel is emphatic, and seems intended to mark the employment of the highest artistic skill on that which was the most precious of all objects connected with the new construction. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/37.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>37:1-29 The making of the ark, and the furniture of the tabernacle. - In the furniture of the tabernacle were emblems of a spiritual and acceptable service. The incense represented the prayers of the saints. The sacrifice of the alter represented the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world. The golden pot with manna, or bread from heaven, the flesh of Jesus Christ, which he gave for the life of the world. The candlestick, with its lights, the teaching and enlightening of the Holy Spirit. The shew-bread represented that provision for those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, which the gospel, the ordinances and the sacraments of the house of prayer, abundantly bestow. The exactness of the workmen to their rule, should be followed by us; seeking for the influences of the Holy Spirit, that we may rejoice in and glorify God while in this world, and at length be with him for ever.</body></html>
