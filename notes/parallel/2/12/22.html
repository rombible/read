It was regarded as having purifying properties (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-4.htm" title="Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:">Leviticus 14:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/14-49.htm" title="And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:">Leviticus 14:49-52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-6.htm" title="And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the middle of the burning of the heifer.">Numbers 19:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-7.htm" title="Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.">Psalm 51:7</a>), and was therefore suitable for sprinkling the blood of expiation.<p><span class= "bld">In the bason.</span>--The word translated "bason" has another meaning also, viz., "threshold;" and this meaning was preferred in the present place both by the LXX. and by Jerome. Whichever translation we adopt, there is a difficulty in the occurrence of the article, since neither the threshold nor any bason had been mentioned previously. Perhaps Moses assumed that whenever a victim was offered, the blood had to be caught in a bason, and therefore spoke of "<span class= "ital">the</span> bason" as something familiar to his hearers in this connection. If the lamb had been sacrificed <span class= "ital">on the threshold,</span> it would scarcely have been necessary to put the blood on the lintel and doorposts also.<p><span class= "bld">None of you shall go out.</span>--Moses seems to have given this command by his own authority, without any positive Divine direction. He understood that the Atoning blood was the sole protection from the destroying angel, and that outside the portal sprinkled with it was no safety.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A bunch of hyssop</span>. The hyssop was regarded as having purging or purifying qualities, and was used in the cleansing of the leper (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-4.htm">Leviticus 14:4</a>), and of the leprous house (<span class="accented">ibid</span>. 51-52), and also formed an element in the "water of separation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-6.htm">Numbers 19:6</a>). It was a species of plant which grew on walls, and was generally low and insignificant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-33.htm">1 Kings 4:33</a>), yet which could furnish a stick or stalk of some length (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-29.htm">John 19:29</a>). It must also have been a common plant in Egypt, the wilderness, and Palestine. Two suggestions are made with respect to it. One, that it was a species of marjoram (<span class="accented">Origanum Aegyptiacum</span>, <span class="accented">or O. Syriacum</span>) common in both Egypt and Syria; the other that it was the caper plant (<span class="accented">Capparis spinosa</span>), which abounds especially in the Desert. (Stanley, <span class="accented">Sinai and Palestine</span>, p. 21.) It is in favour of this latter identification, that the modern Arabic name for the caper plant is <span class="accented">asaf</span> or <span class="accented">asuf</span>, which excellently represents the Hebrew <span class="accented">ezob</span>, the word uniformly rendered in our version by "hyssop" <span class="cmt_word">The blood that is in the basin</span>. The Septuagint and Vulgate render - "that is <span class="accented">on the threshold."</span> <span class="accented">Saph</span> - the word translated "basin" has the double meaning. None of you shall go out. Moses may well have given this advice on his own authority, without any Divine command. (See introductory paragraph.) He would feel that beyond the protection of the blood of the lamb, there was no assurance of safety. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:21-28 That night, when the first-born were to be destroyed, no Israelite must stir out of doors till called to march out of Egypt. Their safety was owing to the blood of sprinkling. If they put themselves from under the protection of that, it was at their peril. They must stay within, to wait for the salvation of the Lord; it is good to do so. In after-times they should carefully teach their children the meaning of this service. It is good for children to ask about the things of God; they that ask for the way will find it. The keeping of this solemnity every year was, 1. To look backward, that they might remember what great things God had done for them and their fathers. Old mercies, to ourselves, or to our fathers, must not be forgotten, that God may be praised, and our faith in him encouraged. 2. It was designed to look forward, as an earnest of the great sacrifice of the Lamb of God in the fulness of time. Christ our passover was sacrificed for us; his death was our life.</body></html>
