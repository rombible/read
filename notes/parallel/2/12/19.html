It is not improbable that many of the "six hundred thousand" reckoned to "Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-37.htm" title="And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.">Exodus 12:37</a>) were of this class--persons who had joined themselves to the nation during the sojourn in Egypt, or even earlier. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-13.htm" title="He that is born in your house, and he that is bought with your money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.">Genesis 17:13</a>.) When the "exclusiveness" of the Hebrews is made a charge against them, justice requires us to remember that from the first it was open to those who were not of Hebrew blood to share in the Hebrew privileges by accepting the covenant of circumcision, and joining themselves to the nation. It was in this way that the Kenites. and even the Gibeonites, became reckoned to Israel.<p><span class= "bld">Born in the land.</span>--Hob., <span class= "ital">natives of the land: i.e.,</span> of Canaan.

It adds an important extension of the punitive clause - "that soul shall be cut off from Israel" - from Israelites proper to proselytes. We are thus reminded, at the very time when Israel is about to become a nation and to enter upon its inheritance of exclusive privileges, that no exclusion of the Gentiles by reason of race or descent was ever contemplated by God, either at the giving of the law, or at any other time. In Abraham all the families of them were to be blessed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). It was always open to any Gentiles to join themselves to Israel by becoming "proselytes of justice," adopting circumcision and the general observance of the law, and joining the Israelite community. The whole law is full of references to persons of this class (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-12.htm">Exodus 23:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-26.htm">Leviticus 18:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-15.htm">Numbers 35:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-14.htm">Deuteronomy 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-17.htm">Deuteronomy 24:17, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-19.htm">Deuteronomy 27:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-11.htm">Deuteronomy 29:11</a>, etc.). It must have been largely recruited in the times immediately following the exodus from the "mixed multitude" which accompanied the Israelites out of Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>), and from the Kenites who joined them in the wilderness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-29.htm">Numbers 10:29-31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Born in the land</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, an Israelite by birth - "the land" is, no doubt, Canaan, which is regarded as the true "Land of Israel" from the time when it was assigned by God to the posterity of Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-20 The Lord makes all things new to those whom he delivers from the bondage of Satan, and takes to himself to be his people. The time when he does this is to them the beginning of a new life. God appointed that, on the night wherein they were to go out of Egypt, each family should kill a lamb, or that two or three families, if small, should kill one lamb. This lamb was to be eaten in the manner here directed, and the blood to be sprinkled on the door-posts, to mark the houses of the Israelites from those of the Egyptians. The angel of the Lord, when destroying the first-born of the Egyptians, would pass over the houses marked by the blood of the lamb: hence the name of this holy feast or ordinance. The passover was to be kept every year, both as a remembrance of Israel's preservation and deliverance out of Egypt, and as a remarkable type of Christ. Their safety and deliverance were not a reward of their own righteousness, but the gift of mercy. Of this they were reminded, and by this ordinance they were taught, that all blessings came to them through the shedding and sprinkling of blood. Observe, 1. The paschal lamb was typical. Christ is our passover, 1Co 5:7. Christ is the Lamb of God, Joh 1:29; often in the Revelation he is called the Lamb. It was to be in its prime; Christ offered up himself in the midst of his days, not when a babe at Bethlehem. It was to be without blemish; the Lord Jesus was a Lamb without spot: the judge who condemned Christ declared him innocent. It was to be set apart four days before, denoting the marking out of the Lord Jesus to be a Saviour, both in the purpose and in the promise. It was to be slain, and roasted with fire, denoting the painful sufferings of the Lord Jesus, even unto death, the death of the cross. The wrath of God is as fire, and Christ was made a curse for us. Not a bone of it must be broken, which was fulfilled in Christ, Joh 19:33, denoting the unbroken strength of the Lord Jesus. 2. The sprinkling of the blood was typical. The blood of the lamb must be sprinkled, denoting the applying of the merits of Christ's death to our souls; we must receive the atonement, Ro 5:11. Faith is the bunch of hyssop, by which we apply the promises, and the benefits of the blood of Christ laid up in them, to ourselves. It was to be sprinkled on the door-posts, denoting the open profession we are to make of faith in Christ. It was not to be sprinkled upon the threshold; which cautions us to take heed of trampling under foot the blood of the covenant. It is precious blood, and must be precious to us. The blood, thus sprinkled, was a means of preserving the Israelites from the destroying angel, who had nothing to do where the blood was. The blood of Christ is the believer's protection from the wrath of God, the curse of the law, and the damnation of hell, Ro 8:1. 3. The solemn eating of the lamb was typical of our gospel duty to Christ. The paschal lamb was not to be looked upon only, but to be fed upon. So we must by faith make Christ our own; and we must receive spiritual strength and nourishment from him, as from our food, see Joh 6:53,55. It was all to be eaten; those who by faith feed upon Christ, must feed upon a whole Christ; they must take Christ and his yoke, Christ and his cross, as well as Christ and his crown. It was to be eaten at once, not put by till morning. To-day Christ is offered, and is to be accepted while it is called to-day, before we sleep the sleep of death. It was to be eaten with bitter herbs, in remembrance of the bitterness of their bondage in Egypt; we must feed upon Christ with sorrow and brokenness of heart, in remembrance of sin. Christ will be sweet to us, if sin be bitter. It was to be eaten standing, with their staves in their hands, as being ready to depart. When we feed upon Christ by faith, we must forsake the rule and the dominion of sin; sit loose to the world, and every thing in it; forsake all for Christ, and reckon it no bad bargain, Heb 13:13,14. 4. The feast of unleavened bread was typical of the Christian life, 1Co 5:7,8. Having received Christ Jesus the Lord, we must continually delight ourselves in Christ Jesus. No manner of work must be done, that is, no care admitted and indulged, which does not agree with, or would lessen this holy joy. The Jews were very strict as to the passover, so that no leaven should be found in their houses. It must be a feast kept in charity, without the leaven of malice; and in sincerity, without the leaven of hypocrisy. It was by an ordinance for ever; so long as we live we must continue feeding upon Christ, rejoicing in him always, with thankful mention of the great things he has done for us.</body></html>
