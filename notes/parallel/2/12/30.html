The combination of public calamity, private grief, and shocked religious fanaticism might well produce a cry "such as there was none like it, neither shall be like it any more" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-6.htm" title="And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.">Exodus 11:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Not a house where there was not one dead.</span> This cannot have been literally true. In half the families a daughter would have "opened the womb;" in others, the firstborn son would have been absent, or dead previously. To judge Scripture fairly, we must make allowance for the hyperbole of Oriental thought and expression, which causes the substitution of universal terms for general ones, and the absence of qualifying clauses. The meaning is that in the great majority of houses there was one dead. This may, well have been so, if we include the dependants and the <span class= "ital">animals.</span> Pet animals--dogs, cats, gazelles, and monkeys--abounded in Egyptian homes.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And Pharaoh rose up in the night, and all his servants</span>. This general disturbance differentiates the present visitations from that which came upon the host of Sennacherib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>). Then, the calamity came with such silence and secrecy, that the deaths were not suspected until men rose to go about their various tasks in the morning Now, every household seems to have been aroused from its sleep in the night. We must suppose sharp and painful illness, terminating after a few hours in death. The disaster itself may have been one from which Egypt often suffers in the spring of the year (Kalisch); but its attacking all the firstborn and no others, and no Israelites, as well as its announcement, plainly showed it to be miraculous. <span class="cmt_word">There was a great cry</span>. See the comment on Exodus 11:6. <span class="cmt_word">For there was not a house where there was not one dead</span>. This is perhaps a slight hyperbole. There would be many families in which there was no son; and some houses might contain no male who had opened the womb. It is always to be borne in mind, that the language of Scripture - especially where exciting and tragical events are narrated - is poetical, or at the least highly rhetorical. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 12:31-36 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:29-36 The Egyptians had been for three days and nights kept in anxiety and horror by the darkness; now their rest is broken by a far more terrible calamity. The plague struck their first-born, the joy and hope of their families. They had slain the Hebrews' children, now God slew theirs. It reached from the throne to the dungeon: prince and peasant stand upon the same level before God's judgments. The destroying angel entered every dwelling unmarked with blood, as the messenger of woe. He did his dreadful errand, leaving not a house in which there was not one dead. Imagine then the cry that rang through the land of Egypt, the long, loud shriek of agony that burst from every dwelling. It will be thus in that dreadful hour when the Son of man shall visit sinners with the last judgment. God's sons, his first-born, were now released. Men had better come to God's terms at first, for he will never come to theirs. Now Pharaoh's pride is abased, and he yields. God's word will stand; we get nothing by disputing, or delaying to submit. In this terror the Egyptians would purchase the favour and the speedy departure of Israel. Thus the Lord took care that their hard-earned wages should be paid, and the people provided for their journey.</body></html>
