It has been denied that the Paschal lamb was, in the true sense of the word, a sacrifice (Carpzov and others). But this passage alone is decisive on the question, and proves that it was. Moreover, it was offered in the holy place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-5.htm">Deuteronomy 16:5, 6</a> ); the blood of it was sprinkled upon the altar, and the fat was burnt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-16.htm">2 Chronicles 30:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-11.htm">2 Chronicles 35:11</a>). Compare also <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-18.htm">Exodus 23:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/9-7.htm">Numbers 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-2.htm">Deuteronomy 16:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The people bowed the head and worshipped</span>. Rather, "and made obeisance." Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-31.htm">Exodus 4:31</a>. By "the people" seems to be meant "the elders of the people." (See ver. 21.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:21-28 That night, when the first-born were to be destroyed, no Israelite must stir out of doors till called to march out of Egypt. Their safety was owing to the blood of sprinkling. If they put themselves from under the protection of that, it was at their peril. They must stay within, to wait for the salvation of the Lord; it is good to do so. In after-times they should carefully teach their children the meaning of this service. It is good for children to ask about the things of God; they that ask for the way will find it. The keeping of this solemnity every year was, 1. To look backward, that they might remember what great things God had done for them and their fathers. Old mercies, to ourselves, or to our fathers, must not be forgotten, that God may be praised, and our faith in him encouraged. 2. It was designed to look forward, as an earnest of the great sacrifice of the Lamb of God in the fulness of time. Christ our passover was sacrificed for us; his death was our life.</body></html>
