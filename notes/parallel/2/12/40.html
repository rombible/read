In the "Introduction" to the Book, we have examined the question, which here arises, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> As to the soundness; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> As to the true meaning, of the Hebrew text, and have arrived at the conclusion that it is sound, and that it means what it says, viz., that 430 years elapsed between the arrival of Jacob in Egypt, with his sons, and sons' sons, and their families, as related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-1.htm">Genesis 46:1-27</a>, and the commencement of the exodus. The time is required by the genealogy of Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-22.htm">1 Chronicles 7:22-27</a>). It is in remarkable accordance with the traditions that Joseph was the minister of Apspi, and that the Jews went out under Menephthah. If not absolutely required for the multiplication of the race from "seventy souls" to above two millions, it is at any rate more in accord with that fact than the alternative number, 215. It is twice repeated, so that "the mistake of a copyist" is almost impossible. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sojourning of the children of Israel, which dwelt in Egypt</span>. Rather, "Which they sojourned in Egypt." (Compare the Septuagint - <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1ff4;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>.) Four hundred and thirty years. Literally "thirty years and four hundred years." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:37-42 The children of Israel set forward without delay. A mixed multitude went with them. Some, perhaps, willing to leave their country, laid waste by plagues; others, out of curiosity; perhaps a few out of love to them and their religion. But there were always those among the Israelites who were not Israelites. Thus there are still hypocrites in the church. This great event was 430 years from the promise made to Abraham: see Ga 3:17. So long the promise of a settlement was unfulfilled. But though God's promises are not performed quickly, they will be, in their season. This is that night of the Lord, that remarkable night, to be celebrated in all generations. The great things God does for his people, are to be not only a few days' wonder, but to be remembered throughout all ages; especially the work of our redemption by Christ. This first passover-night was a night of the Lord, much to be observed; but the last passover-night, in which Christ was betrayed and in which the first passover, with the rest of the Jewish ceremonies, was done away, was a night of the Lord, much more to be observed. Then a yoke, heavier than that of Egypt, was broken from off our necks, and a land, better than that of Canaan, set before us. It was a redemption to be celebrated in heaven, for ever and ever.</body></html>
