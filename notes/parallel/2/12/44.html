Bought slaves were allowed their choice. It is noticeable that the circumcised slave was to be admitted to full religious equality with his master.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every man's servant that is bought for money</span>. Or "every man's slave." The Mosaic Law found servitude existing, and left it existing, only guarding against its extreme <span class="accented">abuses</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-20.htm">Exodus 21:20-27</a>). It put no check on the traffic in slaves. <span class="cmt_word">When thou hast circumcised him</span>. The Jewish commentators say, that the desire of the slave to receive the rite and become a Jew is here implied. But it would seem rather, that opposition and refusal is not thought of as possible (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-13.htm">Genesis 17:13, 17</a>). The case is like that of baptism among the barbarous nations, where no sooner was the king converted than a general order went forth for the baptism of his subjects, which no one thought of resisting. <span class="cmt_word">Then shall he eat thereof</span>. It was a principle of the Jewish law that the slaves should be admitted to complete religious equality with the native Israelites. (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-11.htm">Leviticus 22:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:43-51 In times to come, all the congregation of Israel must keep the passover. All that share in God's mercies should join in thankful praises for them. The New Testament passover, the Lord's supper, ought not to be neglected by any. Strangers, if circumcised, might eat of the passover. Here is an early indication of favour to the gentiles. This taught the Jews that their being a nation favoured by God, entitled them to their privileges, not their descent from Abraham. Christ our passover is sacrificed for us, 1Co 5:7; his blood is the only ransom for our souls; without the shedding of it there is no remission; without the sprinkling of it there can be no salvation. Have we, by faith in him, sheltered our souls from deserved vengeance under the protection of his atoning blood? Do we keep close to him, constantly depending upon him? Do we so profess our faith in the Redeemer, and our obligations to him, that all who pass by may know to whom we belong? Do we stand prepared for his service, ready to walk in his ways, and to separate ourselves from his enemies? These are questions of vast importance to the soul; may the Lord direct our consciences honestly to answer them.</body></html>
