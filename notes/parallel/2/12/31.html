The messengers were undoubtedly chief officials; they "bowed themselves down" before Moses, who was now recognised as "very great" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-3.htm" title="And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.">Exodus 11:3</a>), and delivered their master's message, which granted in express terms all that Moses had ever demanded. Pharaoh's spirit was, for the time, thoroughly broken.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-36.</span> - THE DISMISSAL The first action seems to have been taken by Pharaoh. The "cry" of the people had no doubt been heard in the palace, and he was aware that the blow had not fallen on himself alone, and may have anticipated what the people's feelings would be; but he did not wait for any direct pressure to be put upon him before yielding. He sent his chief officers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-8.htm">Exodus 11:8</a>) while it was still night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31</a>), to inform Moses and Aaron, not only that they might, but that they must take their departure immediately, with all the people, and added that they might take with them their flocks and herds. The surrender was thus complete; and it was accompanied by a request which we should scarcely have expected. Pharaoh craved at the hands of the two brothers a blessing! We are not told how his request was received; but that it should have been made is a striking indication of how his pride was humbled. The overture from Pharaoh was followed rapidly by a popular movement, which was universal and irresistible. The Egyptians "rose up" everywhere, and "were urgent upon the people," to "send them out of the land in haste" (ver. 33); and to expedite their departure readily supplied them at their request with gold and silver and raiment (ver. 35), thus voluntarily spoiling themselves for the benefit of the foreigners. The Israelites, long previously prepared for the moment which had now arrived, made their final arrangements, and before the day was over a lengthy column was set in motion, and proceeded from Rameses, which seems to have been a suburb of Tunis (Brugsch, <span class="accented">Hist</span>. <span class="accented">of Egypt</span>, vol. 2. pp. 96-99), to an unknown place called Succoth, which must have lain towards the south-east, and was probably not very remote from the capital <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he called for Moses and Aaron</span>. Kalisch understands this as a summons to the King's presence (Commentary, p. 130), and even supposes that the two brothers complied, notwithstanding what Moses had said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-29.htm">Exodus 10:29</a>). But perhaps no more is meant than at Pharaoh's instance Moses and Aaron were summoned to an interview with some of the Court officials (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-8.htm">Exodus 11:8</a>). As ye have said. Literally, "according to your words." The reference is to such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-1.htm">Exodus 8:1, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-1.htm">Exodus 9:1, 13</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:29-36 The Egyptians had been for three days and nights kept in anxiety and horror by the darkness; now their rest is broken by a far more terrible calamity. The plague struck their first-born, the joy and hope of their families. They had slain the Hebrews' children, now God slew theirs. It reached from the throne to the dungeon: prince and peasant stand upon the same level before God's judgments. The destroying angel entered every dwelling unmarked with blood, as the messenger of woe. He did his dreadful errand, leaving not a house in which there was not one dead. Imagine then the cry that rang through the land of Egypt, the long, loud shriek of agony that burst from every dwelling. It will be thus in that dreadful hour when the Son of man shall visit sinners with the last judgment. God's sons, his first-born, were now released. Men had better come to God's terms at first, for he will never come to theirs. Now Pharaoh's pride is abased, and he yields. God's word will stand; we get nothing by disputing, or delaying to submit. In this terror the Egyptians would purchase the favour and the speedy departure of Israel. Thus the Lord took care that their hard-earned wages should be paid, and the people provided for their journey.</body></html>
