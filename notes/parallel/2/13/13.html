Horses were well known in Egypt at the time, but were kept only by the kings and the great men. The Hebrews had not been in a position ever to have possessed any. Asses, on the contrary, were exceedingly common, and formed the ordinary beasts of burden in the country. In default of camels, which they seem not to have owned, the Israelites must have carried their tents and other baggage on asses.<p><span class= "bld">Thou shalt redeem.</span>--Since the ass was unclean. In Egypt he is said to have been "Typhonian;" and Set, the Evil Principle, is represented with long ears, which may be those of an ass, cropped towards the upper extremity. The redeeming of an ass with a lamb (or kid) was favourable to the owner, since the ass colt must have been of considerably more value.<p><span class= "bld">If thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck.</span>--There will always be in every nation those who grudge to make any offering to God, and who will seek to evade every requisition for a gift. To check such stinginess, the present law was made. It would be effectual without requiring to be put in force.<p><span class= "bld">All the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.</span>--This was declared in anticipation of the arrangement afterwards to be made, whereby the tribe of Levi was taken in lieu of the firstborn for the service Of the sanctuary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/3-40.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names.">Numbers 3:40-45</a>), and an obligation was imposed on Israelites of other tribes to "redeem" their sons by a payment of five shekels for each to the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/18-15.htm" title="Every thing that opens the matrix in all flesh, which they bring to the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be yours: nevertheless the firstborn of man shall you surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shall you redeem.">Numbers 18:15-16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every firstling of an ass</span>. The ass was the sole beast of burthen taken by the Israelites out of Egypt. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>.) Neither the horse nor the camel was among their possessions in the wilderness. This is agreeable to the Egyptian monuments, by which the camel appears to have been rare in Egypt at this time, and the horse as yet mainly used for war and by the nobles in their chariots. <span class="cmt_word">With a lamb</span>. A lamb or a kid. The word used is the generic one. (See the comment on Exodus 12:3.) <span class="cmt_word">If thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck</span>. This enactment was evidently made to prevent a refusal to redeem. It would not require to be put in force, since by refusing under such a penalty a man would suffer pecuniary loss. <span class="cmt_word">All the first-born of men among thy children</span>. Rather "among thy sons." <span class="cmt_word">Shalt thou redeem</span>. Later on, the amount of the redemption money was fixed at five shekels of the sanctuary for each. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-47.htm">Numbers 3:47</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:11-16 The firstlings of beast not used in sacrifice, were to be changed for others so used, or they were to be destroyed. Our souls are forfeited to God's justice, and unless ransomed by the sacrifice of Christ, will certainly perish. These institutions would continually remind them of their duty, to love and serve the Lord. In like manner, baptism and the Lord's supper, if explained and attended to, would remind us, and give us occasion to remind one another of our profession and duty.</body></html>
