The other two were the Perizzites and the Girgashites, which seem to have been the least important. The most important were the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites; and these are consequently almost always placed first. At the time of the Exodus, and for many centuries afterwards, the actually most powerful nation would seem to have been that of the Hittites. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-4.htm" title="From the wilderness and this Lebanon even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.">Joshua 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-29.htm" title="And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.">1Kings 10:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-6.htm" title="For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, See, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come on us.">2Kings 7:6</a>; and compare the Egyptian and Assyrian remains <span class= "ital">passim.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">A land flowing with milk and honey.</span>--See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm" title="And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good land and a large, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.">Exodus 3:8</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Thou shalt keep this service.</span>--Kalisch concludes from this verse, and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-25.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, when you be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he has promised, that you shall keep this service.">Exodus 12:25</a>, that there was no obligation upon the Israelites to keep the Passover until they obtained possession of Canaan.

This injunction had been already given (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-25.htm">Exodus 12:25</a>) almost in the same words; but on the former occasion it was delivered to the elders only; now it is laid upon the whole people. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-10 In remembrance of the destruction of the first-born of Egypt, both of man and of beast, and the deliverance of the Israelites out of bondage, the first-born males of the Israelites were set apart to the Lord. By this was set before them, that their lives were preserved through the ransom of the atonement, which in due time was to be made for sin. They were also to consider their lives, thus ransomed from death, as now to be consecrated to the service of God. The parents were not to look upon themselves as having any right in their first-born, till they solemnly presented them to God, and allowed his title to them. That which is, by special mercy, spared to us, should be applied to God's honour; at least, some grateful acknowledgment, in works of piety and charity, should be made. The remembrance of their coming out of Egypt must be kept up every year. The day of Christ's resurrection is to be remembered, for in it we were raised up with Christ out of death's house of bondage. The Scripture tells us not expressly what day of the year Christ rose, but it states particularly what day of the week it was; as the more valuable deliverance, it should be remembered weekly. The Israelites must keep the feast of unleavened bread. Under the gospel, we must not only remember Christ, but observe his holy supper. Do this in remembrance of him. Also care must be taken to teach children the knowledge of God. Here is an old law for catechising. It is of great use to acquaint children betimes with the histories of the Bible. And those who have God's law in their heart should have it in their mouth, and often speak of it, to affect themselves, and to teach others.</body></html>
