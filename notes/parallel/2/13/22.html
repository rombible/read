The last distinct mention of the cloud is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-42.htm">Numbers 16:42</a>, after the destruction of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. There is perhaps a later allusion to it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-6.htm">Numbers 20:6</a>. In Nehemiah it is said that "the pillar of the cloud departed not from them," so long as they were in the wilderness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-19.htm">Nehemiah 9:19</a>); and the same is implied, though not formally stated, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15-23</a>. There is no mention of the pillar of the cloud as still with the Israelites in the Book of Joshua. Probably it was last seen on the journey from Beth-jesimoth to Abel-Shittim in the rich Jordan valley (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-49.htm">Numbers 33:49</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:21,22 The Lord went before them in a pillar, or appearance of the Divine Majesty. Christ was with the church in the wilderness, 1Co 10:9. Those whom God brings into a wilderness, he will not leave nor lose there, but will take care to lead them through it. It was great satisfaction to Moses and the pious Israelites, to be sure that they were under Divine guidance. Those who make the glory of God their end, and the word of God their rule, the Spirit of God the guide of their affections, and the providence of God the guide of their affairs, may be sure that the Lord goes before them, though they cannot see it with their eyes: we must now live by faith. When Israel marched, this pillar went before, and pointed out the place of encampment, as Divine Wisdom saw fit. It sheltered by day from the heat, and gave light by night. The Bible is a light to our feet, a lantern to our paths, with which the Saviour's love has provided us. It testifies of Christ. It is to us like the pillar to the Israelites. Listen to that voice which cries, I am the Light of the world; he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the Light of life, Joh 8:12. Jesus Christ alone, as shown in the Bible, and as the Holy Spirit, in answer to prayer, recommends him to the soul, is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, Joh 14:6.</body></html>
