The chapter terminates with a parenthetic insertion of various promises, intended to cheer the Israelites under the hard circumstances of their wanderings in the wilderness, and growing out of the mention of the tabernacle as "the tabernacle of meeting" (ver. 42). "There," says God, "He will meet, not only Moses, to speak to him, but also the children of Israel, to receive their offerings, hear their prayers, and grant their requests. There will he meet them, and there his glory shall be; and the tabernacle shall be thereby sanctified. He will sanctify both the tabernacle and the altar; he will sanctify, moreover, both Aaron and his sons; and he will dwell among the children of Israel, and be their God; and they shall know him." Very precious and gracious promises, made absolutely; though, as the result showed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14-18</a>), contingent on their obedience; and faithfully performed, as long as even a remnant was obedient, during a space of above seven hundred years from the Exodus to the Captivity! <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There will I meet the children of Israel</span>. Lay Israelites might not enter the tabernacle, and could only "meet God" at its entrance, when they brought their sacrifices to the altar. He promises, however, to meet them on these occasions with favour and. acceptance<span class="cmt_word">. The tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory</span>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>. The presence of the Shechinah was the true sanctification of the tabernacle - all the rest was mere type and figure. God not only "put his name there," but put his presence there visibly. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:38-46 A lamb was to be offered upon the altar every morning, and a lamb every evening. This typified the continual intercession which Christ ever lives to make for his church. Though he offered himself but once for all, that one offering thus becomes a continual offering. This also teaches us to offer to God the spiritual sacrifices of prayer and praise every day, morning and evening. Our daily devotions are the most needful of our daily works, and the most pleasant of our daily comforts. Prayer-time must be kept up as duly as meal-time. Those starve their own souls, who keep not up constant attendance on the throne of grace; constancy in religion brings in the comfort of it.</body></html>
