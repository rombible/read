It is the number almost exclusively used under the old covenant, when acts are to attain their result by repetition. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-6.htm" title="And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the veil of the sanctuary.">Leviticus 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-17.htm" title="And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the veil.">Leviticus 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-11.htm" title="And he sprinkled thereof on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.">Leviticus 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-7.htm" title="And he shall sprinkle on him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.">Leviticus 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-14.htm" title="And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.">Leviticus 16:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-4.htm" title="And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times:">Numbers 19:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-4.htm" title="And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day you shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.">Joshua 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-43.htm" title="And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea.

The repetition of the ceremony seven times on seven separate days seems to be intended. Thus was an ideal completeness given to it. Compare the seven days' compassing around of Jericho (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-3.htm">Joshua 6:3, 4</a>,), the seven washings in Jordan by Naaman (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-14.htm">2 Kings 5:14</a>), the seven ascents to the top of Carmel by the servant of Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-43.htm">1 Kings 18:43, 44</a>), etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:1-37 Aaron and his sons were to be set apart for the priest's office, with ceremony and solemnity.
