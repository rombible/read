By "the rump" is meant the broad fat tail which characterises Oriental sheep, and which is said to weigh from six to twenty pounds. (Fellows, <span class= "ital">Asia Minor, </span>p. 10. Comp.

Rather, "the tail." Oriental sheep have very commonly a broad fat tail, which weighs from six to twenty pounds, and is sometimes laid upon a little cart with two wheels, which the sheep drags after it (Herod. 3:113; Leo African. 9. p. 293 A; Fellows, <span class="accented">Asia Minor</span>, p. 10; Gesenius ad voc. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;</span>).

See the comment on ver 13. <span class="cmt_word">The right shoulder</span>. Or "leg," according to some.
