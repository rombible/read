Its composition is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23-25</a>; a passage from which we gather that it was exceedingly rich and costly. <span class="cmt_word">And pour it upon his</span> <span class="cmt_word">head.</span> Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/133-2.htm">Psalm 133:2</a>. While ablution is a rite common to many religions, the religious use of unction is peculiar to the Mosaic and the Christian. In the Mosaic it was applied to initiate into their office the prophet, the priest, and the king. In Christianity it was originally a rite by which sick persons were miraculously cured (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14, 15</a>), from which use it was afterwards extended by ecclesiastical authority to other important ceremonies. The typical meaning under Christianity is clear; the oil represents the Holy Spirit, and the anointing the outpouring of that Spirit on those who are the objects of it. Christ himself obtained his title of Christ (or Messiah), because he was "anointed with the Holy Ghost and with power" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>). Under Mosaism this idea was, at most, latent. Unction was understood to mark <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Dignity, because the olive was the first of trees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-9.htm">Judges 9:9</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Continuance, because oil preserves things for a long time from corruption. Unction with the holy oil of the sanctuary no doubt further signified consecration to God's service. It was applied not only to the priests, but to the tabernacle, the ark, the table of shew-bread with its vessels, the seven branched candlestick, the altar of incense, the altar of burnt offering, and the laver, all of which thereupon became "most holy" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-26.htm">Exodus 30:26-29</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:1-37 Aaron and his sons were to be set apart for the priest's office, with ceremony and solemnity. Our Lord Jesus is the great High Priest of our profession, called of God to be so; anointed with the Spirit, whence he is called Messiah, the Christ; clothed with glory and beauty; sanctified by his own blood; made perfect, or consecrated through sufferings, Heb 2:10. All believers are spiritual priests, to offer spiritual sacrifices,</body></html>
