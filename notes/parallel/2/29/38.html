Two lambs were to be offered every day, one in the morning, the other "between the evenings" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-39.htm" title="The one lamb you shall offer in the morning; and the other lamb you shall offer at even:">Exodus 29:39</a>); partly in expiation of the daily sins of the nation<span class= "bld">, </span>but mainly as a sign that the nation daily renewed its self-dedication to Jehovah, and offered itself afresh to be "a reasonable, holy, and lively sacrifice" to Him. Meat and drink offerings were to accompany the burnt sacrifice--signs of the gratitude due to God for His perpetual mercies, and acknowledgments of His protecting care and lovingkindness. At the same time incense was to be burnt upon the golden altar before the vail, as a figure of the perpetual prayer that it behoved the nation to send up to the Throne of Grace for a continuance of the Divine favour. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/30-7.htm" title="And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresses the lamps, he shall burn incense on it.">Exodus 30:7-8</a>.)<p>(38) <span class= "bld">Two lambs of the first year.</span>--See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-5.htm" title="Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: you shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:">Exodus 12:5</a>. The LXX. insert <span class= "greekheb">???????</span>, "without blemish;" but this general requirement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-22.htm" title="Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a running sore, or scurvy, or scabbed, you shall not offer these to the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them on the altar to the LORD.">Leviticus 22:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/22-24.htm" title="You shall not offer to the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall you make any offering thereof in your land.">Leviticus 22:24-25</a>), relaxed only in the case of free-will offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-23.htm" title="Either a bullock or a lamb that has any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that may you offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.">Leviticus 22:23</a>), does not need to be perpetually repeated.<p>(39) <span class= "bld">At even.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">between the two evenings. </span>(On the meaning of the phrase, see Note 2 on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-6.htm" title="And you shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.">Exodus 12:6</a>.)<p>(40) <span class= "bld">A tenth deal.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">a tenth. </span>A tenth of what measure is not said, but we may presume an ephah to be intended.

The omer is reckoned at rather less than half a gallon.<p><span class= "bld">An hin.</span>--The hin was, like the omer and the ephah, an Egyptian measure.

Scripture says nothing of the disposal of the drink offering. According to Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant. Jud. </span>iii. <span class= "ital">9</span>, ? 4), it was poured out in libation upon the altar. According to others, a portion only was thus disposed of, while the rest was the priests'.

It was not the place where the congregation met together, for the congregation were forbidden to enter it, but the place where God met His people through their mediator and representative, the high priest, who could there commune with God and obtain replies from Him on all practical matters that were of national importance. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-22.htm" title="And there I will meet with you, and I will commune with you from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are on the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give you in commandment to the children of Israel.">Exodus 25:22</a> and Note <span class= "ital">ad loc.</span>) The fact that all communication was to be through the high priest is indicated by the change of person: "Where I will meet <span class= "ital">you, </span>to speak there <span class= "bld">unto </span><span class= "ital">thee.</span>"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 38-42.</span> - THE DAILY SACRIFICE. The consecration of the altar, which is made a part of the consecration of the priests, is to be followed immediately by the establishment of the daily sacrifice. Two lambs are to be offered day by day to the Lord, one in the morning and the other in the evening, as "a continual burnt-offering" (ver. 42), in acknowledgment that the life of the people belonged to Jehovah (Cook), aria that they were bound to offer perpetually "themselves, their souls and bodies, to be a reasonable holy, and lively sacrifice" to him. The burnt-offerings were to be accompanied by appropriate "meat and drink-offerings" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, by a certain quantity of flour mingled with olive oil for the one, and a certain quantity of wine for the other - indications of the debt of gratitude which the nation owed to God for his continual benefits <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lambs of the first year</span>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>. The LXX. add "without blemish." But this is unnecessary, as all victims were to be without blemish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-20.htm">Leviticus 22:20</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-21.htm">Deuteronomy 15:21</a>, etc.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:38-46 A lamb was to be offered upon the altar every morning, and a lamb every evening. This typified the continual intercession which Christ ever lives to make for his church. Though he offered himself but once for all, that one offering thus becomes a continual offering. This also teaches us to offer to God the spiritual sacrifices of prayer and praise every day, morning and evening. Our daily devotions are the most needful of our daily works, and the most pleasant of our daily comforts. Prayer-time must be kept up as duly as meal-time. Those starve their own souls, who keep not up constant attendance on the throne of grace; constancy in religion brings in the comfort of it.</body></html>
