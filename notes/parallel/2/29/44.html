See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a>, where we learn that on the first occasion of Aaron's offering sacrifice upon the brazen altar, "there came a fire out from before the Lord, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat." Thus the altar had its miraculous sanctification, as well as the tabernacle, and was not merely consecrated by human instrumentality. <span class="cmt_word">I will sanctify also both Aaron and his</span> <span class="cmt_word">sons.</span> It would seem to follow, by parity of reasoning, that here also something more is intended than had been accomplished by the rites of consecration. The verb is in the future - "I will sanctify" - and must allude to something which has not yet taken place. Probably, sanctification of the spirit is intended - that Divine influence upon the heart which alone makes men really and truly "holy." (Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-8.htm">Leviticus 21:8, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-9.htm">Leviticus 22:9, 16</a>.) But in this case the promise must have been conditional. God would sanctify them so far as they would allow him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:38-46 A lamb was to be offered upon the altar every morning, and a lamb every evening. This typified the continual intercession which Christ ever lives to make for his church. Though he offered himself but once for all, that one offering thus becomes a continual offering. This also teaches us to offer to God the spiritual sacrifices of prayer and praise every day, morning and evening. Our daily devotions are the most needful of our daily works, and the most pleasant of our daily comforts. Prayer-time must be kept up as duly as meal-time. Those starve their own souls, who keep not up constant attendance on the throne of grace; constancy in religion brings in the comfort of it.</body></html>
