The tenth part of an ephah is no doubt meant. This was sometimes called "an omen" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-36.htm">Exodus 16:36</a>), and would be about three pounds weight of flour, or a little more<span class="cmt_word">. One fourth part of an hin of beaten oil</span>. The word hin is said to be Egyptian. It occurs here for the first time. The bin was the sixth part of a bath, and probably contained about one pint and a half English. <span class="cmt_word">The fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink-offering</span>. The application of the "drink-offerings" is uncertain. Josephus says (<span class="accented">Ant. Jud.</span> 3:9, &sect; 4) that they were poured out round the brazen altar. But the analogy of the "meat offering" makes it probable that a portion only was thus treated, while the greater part belonged to the priests. In the entire provision by which burnt and peace-offering were to be necessarily accompanied with meat-offerings and drink-offerings, we can scarcely be wrong in seeing an arrangement made especially for the convenience of the priests. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:38-46 A lamb was to be offered upon the altar every morning, and a lamb every evening. This typified the continual intercession which Christ ever lives to make for his church. Though he offered himself but once for all, that one offering thus becomes a continual offering. This also teaches us to offer to God the spiritual sacrifices of prayer and praise every day, morning and evening. Our daily devotions are the most needful of our daily works, and the most pleasant of our daily comforts. Prayer-time must be kept up as duly as meal-time. Those starve their own souls, who keep not up constant attendance on the throne of grace; constancy in religion brings in the comfort of it.</body></html>
