and shall anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister to me in the priest's office.">Exodus 28:41</a>). The method of it is now laid down. It consists of five things :--(1) Ablution (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-4.htm" title="And Aaron and his sons you shall bring to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall wash them with water.">Exodus 29:4</a>); (2) Investiture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/29-5.htm" title="And you shall take the garments, and put on Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod:">Exodus 29:5-9</a>); (3) Chrism, or anointing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-7.htm" title="Then shall you take the anointing oil, and pour it on his head, and anoint him.">Exodus 29:7</a>); (4) Sacrifice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/29-10.htm" title="And you shall cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands on the head of the bullock.">Exodus 29:10-23</a>); and (5) Filling the hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-24.htm" title="And you shall put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD.">Exodus 29:24</a>). All of these were symbolical acts, typical of things spiritual--ablution, of the putting away of impurity; investiture, of being clothed with holiness; unction, of the giving of Divine grace, &c.; the entire consecration forming an acted parable, very suggestive and full of instruction to such as understood its meaning.<p><span class= "bld">Take one young bullock.</span>--The <span class= "ital">first </span>thing to be done was to prepare the victims which would be needed, and to have them ready against the time when they would be required for sacrifice.<p><span class= "bld">Without blemish.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">perfect </span>(See Note 1 on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-5.htm" title="Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: you shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:">Exodus 12:5</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-37.</span> - THE CONSECRATION OF THE PRIESTS. From the description of the priestly attire, the Divine Law-giver passed to the form of priestly consecration, whereof investiture in the "holy garments" was a part. The ceremony of consecration was to consist of four things: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Ablution; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Investiture; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Chrism or Anointing with oil; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> Sacrifice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the directions given, we have, first, the preparation of the offerings (vers. 1-3); secondly, directions for the ablutions (ver. 4); thirdly, directions for the investiture of Aaron (vers. 5, 6), of his sons (vers. 8, 9); fourthly, directions for the anointing (ver. 7); and fifthly, directions as to the mode in which the sacrifices should be offered and disposed of (vers. 10-34). A command is then given that the ceremonies should be repeated every day for a week (ver. 35); and another, that the altar should receive consecration at the same time as the priests (vers. 36, 37). Additional light is thrown on most of these matters by the account contained in Leviticus (ch. 8.), of the manner in which Moses carried oat the directions here given to him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is the thing that thou shalt do to them</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "This is the ceremonial that thou shalt use on the occasion." There is a tacit reference to verse 41 of ch. 28, which had announced that the priests were to be consecrated. <span class="cmt_word">Take one young bullock</span>. The offerings were to be provided beforehand, so as to be in readiness when the investiture and anointing were over. Hence they are mentioned first. <span class="cmt_word">Rams without blemish</span>. Literally "perfect."
