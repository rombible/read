It must be viewed as a "peace-offering" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-1.htm">Leviticus 3:1-17</a>), but one of a peculiar character. The application of the blood to the persons of the priests was altogether unique, and most significant. It was the crowning act of consecration, and implied the complete dedication of their life and of all their powers to the service of the Almighty. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:1-37 Aaron and his sons were to be set apart for the priest's office, with ceremony and solemnity.
