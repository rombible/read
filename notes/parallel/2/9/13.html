This is the first plague of the third group, and presents to us several new features. (1) It is ushered in with an unusually long and exceeding awful message (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/9-13.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus said the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.">Exodus 9:13-19</a>), in which Pharaoh is warned that God is now about to "send <span class= "ital">all</span> His plagues <span class= "ital">upon his heart,"</span> and that he has been raised up simply that God may show forth His power in his person. (2) It is the first plague that attacks human life; and this it does upon a large scale: all those exposed to it perish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-19.htm" title="Send therefore now, and gather your cattle, and all that you have in the field; for on every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down on them, and they shall die.">Exodus 9:19</a>). (3) It is more destructive than any previous plague to property. It not only slays cattle, like the murrain. but destroys plants and trees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-25.htm" title="And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.">Exodus 9:25</a>), and ruins half the harvest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-31.htm" title="And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom.">Exodus 9:31</a>). (4) It is accompanied with terrible demonstrations--"mighty thunderings," huge hailstones, rain, and fire that "runs along upon the ground" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-23.htm" title="And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along on the ground; and the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt.">Exodus 9:23</a>). (5) It is made to test the degree of faith to which the Egyptians have attained, by means of a revelation of the way whereby it may be escaped (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-20.htm" title="He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:">Exodus 9:20</a>). Though the plagues do not form a regularly ascending series, each transcending the last, yet there is a certain progression observable. The earlier ones cause annoyance rather than injury; those which follow cause loss of property; then God's hand is laid on men's persons, so as to hurt, but not to kill; lastly, life itself is attacked. The seventh plague was peculiarly astonishing and alarming to the Egyptians, because hail and thunder, even rain, were rare phenomena in their country; and a thunderstorm accompanied by such features as characterised this one was absolutely unknown. The hailstones must have been of an enormous size and weight to kill men and cattle. The "fire infolding itself amid the hail" must indicate a very unusual form of the electric fluid. It is not surprising that the visitation brought down the pride of Pharaoh more than any preceding one, and made him for the time consent unconditionally to the people's departure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-28.htm" title="Entreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunder and hail; and I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.">Exodus 9:28</a>).<p>(13) <span class= "bld">Early in the morning.</span>--Comp, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-15.htm" title="Get you to Pharaoh in the morning; see, he goes out to the water; and you shall stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shall you take in your hand.">Exodus 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-20.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; see, he comes forth to the water; and say to him, Thus said the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.">Exodus 8:20</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-26.</span> - THE SEVENTH PLAGUE. The sixth plague had had no effect at all upon the hard heart of the Pharaoh, who cared nothing for the physical sufferings of his subjects, and apparently was not himself afflicted by the malady. Moses was therefore ordered to appear before him once more, and warn him of further and yet more terrible visitations which were impending. The long message (vers. 13-19) is without any previous parallel, and contains matter calculated to make an impression even upon the most callous of mortals. First there is an announcement that God is about to send "<span class="accented">all</span> his plagues" upon king and people (ver. 14); then a solemn warning that a pestilence might have been sent which would have swept both king and people from the face of the earth (ver. 15); and finally (ver. 18) an announcement of the actual judgment immediately impending, which is to be a hailstorm of a severity never previously known in Egypt, and but rarely experienced elsewhere. Pharaoh is moreover told that the whole object of his having been allowed by God to continue in existence is the glory about to accrue to his name from the exhibition of his power in the deliverance of his people (ver. 16). A peculiar feature of the plague is the warning (ver. 19) whereby those who believed the words of Moses, were enabled to escape a great part of the ill effects of the storm. It is a remarkable indication of the impression made by the previous plagues, that the warning was taken by a considerable number of the Egyptians, who by this means saved their cattle and their slaves (ver. 20). The injury caused by the plague was very great. The flax and barley crops, which were the most advanced suffered complete destruction. Men and beasts were wounded by the hail-stones, which might have been - as hail-stones sometimes are - jagged pieces of ice; and some were even killed, either by the hail (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>), or by the lightning which accompanied it. Even trees were damaged by the force of the storm, which destroyed the foliage and broke the branches. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rise up early</span>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-15.htm">Exodus 7:15</a>, and Exodus 8:20. The practice of the Egyptian kings to rise early and proceed at once to the dispatch of business is noted by Herodotus (2:173). It is a common practice of oriental monarchs. <span class="cmt_word">And say unto him</span>. The same message is constantly repeated in the same words as a token of God's unchangingness. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-1.htm">Exodus 8:1-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-1.htm">Exodus 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-3.htm">Exodus 10:3</a>; etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:13-21 Moses is here ordered to deliver a dreadful message to Pharaoh. Providence ordered it, that Moses should have a man of such a fierce and stubborn spirit as this Pharaoh to deal with; and every thing made it a most signal instance of the power of God has to humble and bring down the proudest of his enemies. When God's justice threatens ruin, his mercy at the same time shows a way of escape from it. God not only distinguished between Egyptians and Israelites, but between some Egyptians and others. If Pharaoh will not yield, and so prevent the judgment itself, yet those that will take warning, may take shelter. Some believed the things which were spoken, and they feared, and housed their servants and cattle, and it was their wisdom. Even among the servants of Pharaoh, some trembled at God's word; and shall not the sons of Israel dread it? But others believed not, and left their cattle in the field. Obstinate unbelief is deaf to the fairest warnings, and the wisest counsels, which leaves the blood of those that perish upon their own heads.</body></html>
