Doubts may be entertained as to its exact character, and its proper medical designation, but all agree, and cannot but agree, that it was a visitation of the bodies of men with a severe cutaneous disorder, accompanied by pustules or ulcers. It was not announced beforehand to the Egyptians, nor were they allowed the opportunity of escaping it. Like the third plague, it was altogether of the nature of a judgment; and the judgment was a severe one. Now, for the first time, was acute suffering inflicted on the persons of men; now, for the first time, was it shown how Jehovah could smite with a terrible disease; and if with a disease, why not with death? No doubt those stricken suffered unequally; but with some the affliction may have resembled the final affliction of Job, when he was smitten with "sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-7.htm" title="So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to his crown.">Job 2:7</a>). Its severity is marked by the statement that "the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-11.htm" title="And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was on the magicians, and on all the Egyptians.">Exodus 9:11</a>). And it was universal, or quasi-universal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-11.htm" title="And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was on the magicians, and on all the Egyptians.">Exodus 9:11</a>). Moreover, it was not confined to men; it was also "upon the beasts"--i.e., upon such of the domesticated animals as had escaped the preceding plague. It does not, however, seem to have been fatal; and it wrought no change upon the Pharaoh, whose heart God is now, for the first time, said to have hardened (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-12.htm" title="And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he listened not to them; as the LORD had spoken to Moses.">Exodus 9:12</a>), as He had declared to Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-21.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, When you go to return into Egypt, see that you do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in your hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.">Exodus 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-3.htm" title="And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.">Exodus 7:3</a>).<p>(8) <span class= "bld">Ashes of the furnace.</span>--Furnaces in Egypt were either for the melting of metal, the preparing of lime, or the baking of bricks. It was probably from a furnace of this last kind that the ashes were now taken. Much of Goshen had been converted into a brick-field (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-14.htm" title="And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigor.">Exodus 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/5-7.htm" title="You shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.">Exodus 5:7-13</a>); and though most of the bricks made would be simply dried in the sun, a portion would be subjected to artificial heat in brick-kilns. When ashes from one of these kilns were made the germs of a disease that was a sore infliction, their own wrongdoing became to the Egyptians a whip wherewith God scourged them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-12.</span> - THE SIXTH PLAGUE. The sixth plague was sent, like the third, without notice given. It was also, like the third, a plague which inflicted direct injury upon the person. There was a very solemn warning in it; for the same power that could afflict the body with "boils and blains," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, with a severe cutaneous disease accompanied by pustulous ulcers - could also (it must have been felt) smite it with death. It is uncertain what exactly the malady was. Some have supposed elephantiasis, some "black leprosy," some merely an eruptive disease such as is even now common m Egypt during the autumn. But it is, at any rate, evident that the malady was exceedingly severe - "the magicians could not stand before Moses" because of it (ver. 11). If it was "the botch of Egypt" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27</a>), as seems probable, since the name in the Hebrew is the same, it was incurable. Pharaoh and his people were warned by it that God's power would be shown on themselves, not in the way of mere annoyance - as with the earlier plagues - but of serious injury - and if <span class="accented">so</span>, why not of death? Thus, the sixth plague heralded the tenth, and, except the tenth, was the most severe of all. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ashes of the furnace</span>. Rather "soot from the furnace." The word commonly used in Hebrew for "ashes" is different. Many recondite reasons have been brought forward for the directions here given. But perhaps the object was simply to show that as water, and earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-13.htm">Exodus 8:13</a>) and air (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-13.htm">Exodus 10:13</a>) could be turned into plagues, so fire could be. The "soot of the furnace" might well represent fire, and was peculiarly appropriate for the preduction of a disease which was in the main an "inflammation." It is not likely that Moses imitated any superstitious practice of the priests of Egypt. <span class="cmt_word">Toward the heaven</span>. The act indicated that the plague would come from heaven - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from God. <span class="cmt_word">In the sight of Pharaoh</span>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20</a> It is probable that the symbolic act which brought the plague was performed "in the sight of Pharaoh" in every case, except where the plague was unannounced, though the fact is not always recorded. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:8-12 When the Egyptians were not wrought upon by the death of their cattle, God sent a plague that seized their own bodies. If lesser judgments do not work, God will send greater. Sometimes God shows men their sin in their punishment. They had oppressed Israel in the furnaces, and now the ashes of the furnace are made a terror to them. The plague itself was very grievous. The magicians themselves were struck with these boils. Their power was restrained before; but they continued to withstand Moses, and to confirm Pharaoh in his unbelief, till they were forced to give way. Pharaoh continued obstinate. He had hardened his own heart, and now God justly gave him up to his own heart's lusts, permitting Satan to blind and harden him. If men shut their eyes against the light, it is just with God to close their eyes. This is the sorest judgment a man can be under out of hell.</body></html>
