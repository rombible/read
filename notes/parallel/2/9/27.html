This may have been partly because it caused destruction of human life, partly on account of its extraordinary and awful character. It must be borne in mind that the storm was still continuing, and gave no sign of coming to a natural end (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-29.htm" title="And Moses said to him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that you may know how that the earth is the LORD's.">Exodus 9:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-33.htm" title="And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth.">Exodus 9:33</a>).<p><span class= "bld">I have sinned this time</span>--i.e., This time I confess that I have sinned in resisting Jehovah; I do not any more maintain that I have acted right.<p><span class= "bld">The Lord is righteous.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">Jehovah is the Just One</span>--a form of speech implying that Jehovah, <span class= "ital">and He alone,</span> was just.<p><span class= "bld">Wicked.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">the sinners.</span> "I and my people" stand in contrast with God and His people. Previously Pharaoh had denounced the Israelites as idlers and hypocrites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-8.htm" title="And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, you shall lay on them; you shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.">Exodus 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-17.htm" title="But he said, You are idle, you are idle: therefore you say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD.">Exodus 5:17</a>); now he admits that it is only he and his people that are to blame. The confession is satisfactory, except in so far as it divides between Pharaoh and the Egyptians the blame which was almost wholly his.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27-35.</span> - The plague of hail impressed the Pharaoh more than any previous one. It was the first which had inflicted death on men. It was a most striking and terrible manifestation. It was quite unlike anything which the Egyptians had ever experienced before (vers. 18, 24). It was, by manifest miracle, made to fall on the Egyptians only (ver. 26). Pharaoh was therefore more humbled than ever previously. He acknowledged that he "had sinned" (ver. 27); he added a confession that "Jehovah [alone] was righteous, he and his people wicked" (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>). And, as twice before, he expressed his willingness to let the Israelites take their departure if the plague were removed (ver. 28). The ultimate results, however, were not any better than before. No sooner had Moses prayed to God, and procured the cessation of the plague, than the king repented of his repentance, "hardened his heart;" and, once more casting his promise to the winds, refused to permit the Israelites to depart (vers. 33-35). His people joined him in this act of obduracy (ver. 34), perhaps thinking that they had now suffered the worst that could befall them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Pharaoh sent</span>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-8.htm">Exodus 8:8</a>, and 25-28. Pharaoh had been driven to entreat only twice before. <span class="cmt_word">I have sinned this time</span>. The meaning is, "I acknowledge this time that I have sinned" (Kaliseh, Cook). <span class="accented">"I</span> do not any longer maintain that my conduct has been right." The confession is made for the first time, and seems to have been extorted by the terrible nature of the plague, which, instead of passing off, like most storms, continued. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is righteous</span>, etc. Literally, "Jehovah is <span class="accented">the</span> Just One; and I and my people are <span class="accented">the</span> sinners." The confession seems, at first sight, ample and satisfactory; but there is perhaps some shifting of sin, that was all his own, upon the Egyptian "<span class="accented">people</span>," which indicates disingenuousness. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:22-35 Woful havoc this hail made: it killed both men and cattle; the corn above ground was destroyed, and that only preserved which as yet was not come up. The land of Goshen was preserved. God causes rain or hail on one city and not on another, either in mercy or in judgment. Pharaoh humbled himself to Moses. No man could have spoken better: he owns himself wrong; he owns that the Lord is righteous; and God must be justified when he speaks, though he speaks in thunder and lightning. Yet his heart was hardened all this while. Moses pleads with God: though he had reason to think Pharaoh would repent of his repentance, and he told him so, yet he promises to be his friend. Moses went out of the city, notwithstanding the hail and lightning which kept Pharaoh and his servants within doors. Peace with God makes men thunder-proof. Pharaoh was frightened by the tremendous judgment; but when that was over, his fair promises were forgotten. Those that are not bettered by judgments and mercies, commonly become worse.</body></html>
