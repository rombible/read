and thus he now "sinned yet more" than he had as yet sinned. It seems strange that the mercy of God should still have allowed him one other chance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/10-3.htm" title="And Moses and Aaron came in to Pharaoh, and said to him, Thus said the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.">Exodus 10:3-6</a>).<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He sinned yet more, and hardened his heart</span>. Altogether there are three different Hebrew verbs, which our translators have rendered by "harden," or "hardened" - <span class="accented">kabad</span>, <span class="accented">qashah</span>, and <span class="accented">khazaq.</span> The first of these, which occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-14.htm">Exodus 7:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-15.htm">Exodus 8:15, 32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-7.htm">Exodus 9:7</a> and 34, is the weakest of the three, and means to be "dull" or "heavy," rather than "to be hard." The second, which appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3</a>, and Exodus 13:15, is a stronger term, and means "to be hard," or, in the Hiphil, "to make hard." But the third has the most intensive sense, implying fixed and stubborn resolution. It occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-22.htm">Exodus 7:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-19.htm">Exodus 8:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-35.htm">Exodus 9:35</a>; and elsewhere. He and his servants. Pharaoh's "servants," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the officers of his court, still, it would seem, upheld the king in his impious and mad course, either out of complaisance, or because they were really not yet convinced of the resistless might of Jehovah. After the eighth plague, we shall find their tone change (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-7.htm">Exodus 10:7</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the Lord had spoken by Moses</span>.

The land of Goshen was preserved. God causes rain or hail on one city and not on another, either in mercy or in judgment. Pharaoh humbled himself to Moses. No man could have spoken better: he owns himself wrong; he owns that the Lord is righteous; and God must be justified when he speaks, though he speaks in thunder and lightning. Yet his heart was hardened all this while. Moses pleads with God: though he had reason to think Pharaoh would repent of his repentance, and he told him so, yet he promises to be his friend. Moses went out of the city, notwithstanding the hail and lightning which kept Pharaoh and his servants within doors. Peace with God makes men thunder-proof. Pharaoh was frightened by the tremendous judgment; but when that was over, his fair promises were forgotten. Those that are not bettered by judgments and mercies, commonly become worse.</body></html>
