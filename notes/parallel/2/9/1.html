It was a <span class= "ital">rinderpest,</span> or murrain upon cattle; which, however, unlike most similar disorders, attacked <span class= "ital">the greater number</span> of the domesticated animals--horses, asses, camels, oxen, and sheep. Thus it was "very grievous" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-3.htm" title="Behold, the hand of the LORD is on your cattle which is in the field, on the horses, on the asses, on the camels, on the oxen, and on the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.">Exodus 9:3</a>). Horses were highly prized by the Egyptians, and were a comparatively recent importation, having been unknown before the time of the seventeenth, or "Shepherd" Dynasty. They were at first used only in war; then by rich men, in peace, to draw their chariots. They had now, however, it would seem, come to be employed also in agriculture. (Note the words "in the field.") Asses were the ordinary beasts of burthen, and abounded in Egypt anciently as indeed they do at the present day. The Egyptian monuments mention cases where a single landowner owned as many as seven or eight hundred of them. Camels are not represented by the Egyptian sculptors, but are mentioned in the inscriptions (Chabas, <span class= "ital">Etudes sur l' Antiquite Historique,</span> pp. 400-413), and must have been employed in the trade between Egypt and the Sinaitic peninsula. Both oxen and sheep were numerous, and constituted a great part of the wealth of individuals. The plague fell upon such animals as were "in the field" at the time--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in the open air, and not confined in stables or sheds. It was the Egyptian practice to house a considerable portion of their cattle; but at the probable season of this plague--December or January--the majority would be in the pastures. Thus the Egyptian losses were very heavy, and the king, no doubt, suffered with the rest, for the Egyptian monarchs were large cattle-owners (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-6.htm" title="The land of Egypt is before you; in the best of the land make your father and brothers to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if you know any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.">Genesis 47:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-17.htm" title="And they brought their cattle to Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.">Genesis 47:17</a>), The Pharaoh was, however, less impressed by this plague than by the fourth, and made no sign of submission.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - Excepting in the designation of Jehovah as "the Lord God of the Hebrews," this verse is an almost exact repetition of the first verse of ch. 8. Such repetitious are very characteristic of the most ancient writings. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-7 God will have Israel released, Pharaoh opposes it, and the trial is, whose word shall stand. The hand of the Lord at once is upon the cattle, many of which, some of all kinds, die by a sort of murrain. This was greatly to the loss of the owners; they had made Israel poor, and now God would make them poor. The hand of God is to be seen, even in the sickness and death of cattle; for a sparrow falls not to the ground without our Father. None of the Israelites' cattle should die; the Lord shall sever. The cattle died. The Egyptians worshipped their cattle. What we make an idol of, it is just with God to remove from us. This proud tyrant and cruel oppressor deserved to be made an example by the just Judge of the universe. None who are punished according to what they deserve, can have any just cause to complain. Hardness of heart denotes that state of mind upon which neither threatenings nor promise, neither judgements nor mercies, make any abiding impression. The conscience being stupified, and the heart filled with pride and presumption, they persist in unbelief and disobedience. This state of mind is also called the stony heart. Very different is the heart of flesh, the broken and contrite heart. Sinners have none to blame but themselves, for that pride and ungodliness which abuse the bounty and patience of God. For, however the Lord hardens the hearts of men, it is always as a punishment of former sins.</body></html>
