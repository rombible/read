The first asked only for permission to enter the wilderness, much of which was within the limits of Egypt; the second was a demand that the Israelites should be allowed "to go out of the land." Such is the way of Providence generally. If we refuse a light cross, a heavier cross is laid on us. If we will not close with the Sybil on the first occasion, she offers us a worse bargain on the second.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Out of his land</span>. Note the advance in the demand. No longer is there any limitation to a three days' journey, as at first (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-3.htm">Exodus 5:3</a>). The children of Israel are to be let go altogether "out of the land." So generally, if God lays a light burthen upon us and we refuse it, we may expect him to exchange our light burthen for a heavier one. We had better accept the first cross he offers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:10-13 The faith of Moses was so feeble that he could scarcely be kept to his work. Ready obedience is always according to the strength of our faith. Though our weaknesses ought to humble us, yet they ought not to discourage us from doing our best in any service we have to do for God. When Moses repeats his baffled arguments, he is argued with no longer, but God gives him and Aaron a charge, both to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh. God's authority is sufficient to answer all objections, and binds all to obey, without murmuring or disputing, Php 2:14.</body></html>
