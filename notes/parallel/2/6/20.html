Life in Egypt at the time not unfrequently reached 120 years; but the 137 of Levi, the 133 of Kohath, and the 137 of Amram, the father of Moses, would, even in Egypt, have been abnormal.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Amram</span>. That this Amram is the "man of the house of Levi" mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-1.htm">Exodus 2:1</a>, cannot be doubted; but it is scarcely possible that he should be the Amram of ver. 18, the actual son of Kohath and contemporary of Joseph. He is probably a descendant of the sixth or seventh generation, who bore the same name, and was the head of the Amramite house. That house, at the time of the Exodus, numbered above two thousand males (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-27.htm">Numbers 3:27, 28</a>). See the excellent remarks of Keil and Delitzsch, 'Biblical Commentary,' vol. 1. p. 470, E. T.; and compare Kurtz, 'History of Old Covenant,' vol. 2. p. 144, and Cook, in 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 1. p. 274. <span class="cmt_word">Jochebed his father's sister</span>. Marriages with aunts and nieces have been common in many countries, and are not forbidden by any natural instinct. They first became unlawful by the positive command recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-12.htm">Leviticus 18:12</a>. The name Jochebed is the earliest known compounded with Jah, or Jehovah. It means "the glory of Jehovah." <span class="cmt_word">She bare him Aaron and Moses</span>. Aaron is placed first, as being older than Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-7.htm">Exodus 7:7</a>). Miriam is omitted, since the object of the writer is confined to tracing descent in the male line. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:14-30 Moses and Aaron were Israelites; raised up unto them of their brethren, as Christ also should be, who was to be the Prophet and Priest, the Redeemer and Lawgiver of the people of Israel. Moses returns to his narrative, and repeats the charge God had given him to deliver his message to Pharaoh, and his objection against it. Those who have spoken unadvisedly with their lips ought to reflect upon it with regret, as Moses seems to do here.Uncircumcised, is used in Scripture to note the unsuitableness there may be in any thing to answer its proper purpose; as the carnal heart and depraved nature of fallen man are wholly unsuited to the services of God, and to the purposes of his glory. It is profitable to place no confidence in ourselves, all our sufficiency must be in the Lord. We never can trust ourselves too little, or our God too much. I can do nothing by myself, said the apostle, but I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</body></html>
