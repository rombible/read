<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-11.htm" title="And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.">Genesis 46:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-27.htm" title="And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were three score and ten.">Genesis 46:27</a>), which was when he was about forty or fifty years of age. It is not unlikely that they were at that time all grown up. If Levi lived to be "an hundred thirty and seven years" old, he would probably before he died have seen his descendants of the fifth generation. Attempts have been made to show that the present genealogy is complete, and that Moses was Levi's great-grandson. But in Joshua's case there were ten generations (at least) between him and Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/7-23.htm" title="And when he went in to his wife, she conceived, and bore a son, and he called his name Beriah, because it went evil with his house.">1Chronicles 7:23-27</a>); so that three generations only between Jacob and Moses are scarcely possible. The Israelites were in the habit of constructing their genealogies by omitting some of the links, as we see plainly in the genealogy of Ezra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/7-1.htm" title="Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,">Ezra 7:1-5</a>) and in St. Matthew's genealogy of our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-8.htm" title="And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;">Matthew 1:8</a>). In this present genealogy four or five (perhaps more) names are probably omitted between Amram, the son of Kohath. and Amram, the father of Moses, as will appear if we model the genealogy of Moses upon that of Joshua.<p>(17) <span class= "bld">The sons of Gershon.</span>--From this point the genealogy is no longer a recapitulation, but an original historical document of first-rate importance, which is confirmed by Numbers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/3-18.htm" title="And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families; Libni, and Shimei.">Numbers 3:18-33</a>) and Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-17.htm" title="And these be the names of the sons of Gershom; Libni, and Shimei.">1Chronicles 6:17-19</a>). It is remarkable that Gershon had but two sons, Kohath but four, and Merari but two. Yet the Levites in the year after the Exodus numbered 22,300 males (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-22.htm" title="Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, even those that were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred.">Numbers 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-28.htm" title="In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, were eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary.">Numbers 3:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-34.htm" title="And those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, were six thousand and two hundred.">Numbers 3:34</a>). This increase could only have taken place, at the rate indicated, in the course of some ten or eleven generations.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sons of Levi</span>. The same three sons are given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-11.htm">Genesis 46:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-17.htm">Numbers 3:17</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-2.htm">1 Chronicles 6:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">According to their generations</span>. This phrase is introduced because the writer does not here stop at the sons, but proceeds on to the grandsons, great-grandsons, and other descendants. (See vers. 17-25.) He is concerned especially in this place with the descent of Moses, and therefore with the genealogy of the tribe of Levi, and has only inserted any account of the families descended from Reuben and Simeon, that he might not seem to disregard the claims of primogeniture. <span class="cmt_word">The years of the life of Levi</span>. These began about forty or fifty years before the descent into Egypt, which took place after the birth of all his three sons, as appears front <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-8.htm">Genesis 46:8-11</a>. The length of Levi's life is recorded, not from any chronological considerations, but to show God's blessing upon the family of Moses, which gave such length of days to so many of his ancestors. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:14-30 Moses and Aaron were Israelites; raised up unto them of their brethren, as Christ also should be, who was to be the Prophet and Priest, the Redeemer and Lawgiver of the people of Israel. Moses returns to his narrative, and repeats the charge God had given him to deliver his message to Pharaoh, and his objection against it. Those who have spoken unadvisedly with their lips ought to reflect upon it with regret, as Moses seems to do here.Uncircumcised, is used in Scripture to note the unsuitableness there may be in any thing to answer its proper purpose; as the carnal heart and depraved nature of fallen man are wholly unsuited to the services of God, and to the purposes of his glory. It is profitable to place no confidence in ourselves, all our sufficiency must be in the Lord. We never can trust ourselves too little, or our God too much. I can do nothing by myself, said the apostle, but I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</body></html>
