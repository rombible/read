Now they could not even be induced to listen. But there is nothing strange in this. The reason is obvious. The first announcement of coming deliverance elated them with a hope to which they had been long strangers. Their spirits sprang to the message, and readily accepted it. But now they had been chilled by disappointment. The only result of their leader's interference hitherto had been to increase their misery (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/4-7.htm" title="And he said, Put your hand into your bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.">Exodus 4:7-23</a>).

The expression points to extreme lassitude and depression.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - Hope deferred maketh the heart sick. The Israelites, who had expected a speedy deliverance, and found themselves only the more down-trodden for Moses' interference, were too much dispirited to be cheered even by the gracious promises and assurances which Moses was commissioned to give. They had no longer any trust in one who they thought had deceived them. He was a dreamer, a visionary, if no worse. They did not intend hearkening to him any more. "Anguish of spirit" possessed their souls, and "cruel bondage" claimed their bodies, day after day. They had not even the time, had they had the will, to hearken. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Anguish of spirit</span>. Literally, "shortness." Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-4.htm">Job 21:4</a>. Their spirit was shortened - they had lost all heart, as we say, so cruel had been their disappointment. The contrast between their feelings now, and when Moses first addressed them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-31.htm">Exodus 4:31</a>), is strong, but "fully accounted for by the change of circumstances". (Cook). Cruel bondage. Bondage, <span class="accented">i.e</span>., far more oppressive and continuous than. it had been (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-9.htm">Exodus 5:9-14</a>). The Samaritan version adds: "And they said to him, Let us alone, and let us serve the Egyptians; for it is better for us to serve the Egyptians than die in a wilderness," an addition which receives some support from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-12.htm">Exodus 14:12</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 6:10-12 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-9 We are most likely to prosper in attempts to glorify God, and to be useful to men, when we learn by experience that we can do nothing of ourselves; when our whole dependence is placed on him, and our only expectation is from him. Moses had been expecting what God would do; but now he shall see what he will do. God would now be known by his name Jehovah, that is, a God performing what he had promised, and finishing his own work. God intended their happiness: I will take you to me for a people, a peculiar people, and I will be to you a God. More than this we need not ask, we cannot have, to make us happy. He intended his own glory: Ye shall know that I am the Lord. These good words, and comfortable words, should have revived the drooping Israelites, and have made them forget their misery; but they were so taken up with their troubles, that they did not heed God's promises. By indulging discontent and fretfulness, we deprive ourselves of the comfort we might have, both from God's word and from his providence, and go comfortless.</body></html>
