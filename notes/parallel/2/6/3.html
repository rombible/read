walk before me, and be you perfect.">Genesis 17:1</a>). It is used by Isaac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-3.htm" title="And God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a multitude of people;">Genesis 28:3</a>), and repeated in the revelation made to Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-11.htm" title="And God said to him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of you, and kings shall come out of your loins;">Genesis 35:11</a> ). Its primary idea is, no doubt, that of "overpowering strength." (See the comment on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-1.htm" title="And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said to him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be you perfect.">Genesis 17:1</a>.) The primary idea of "Jehovah" is, on the contrary, that of absolute, eternal, unconditional, independent existence. Both names were probably of a great antiquity, and widely spread among Semitic races; but, at different times and in different places, special stress was laid on the one or on the other. To the early patriarchs God revealed Himself as "El Shaddai," because He desired to impress upon them His ability to fulfil the promises which He had made to them; to Moses and Israel generally, at the date of the Exodus, He insisted on His name Jehovah, because they were in the closest contact with polytheism, and had themselves, in many cases, fallen into polytheism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-14.htm" title="Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve you the LORD.">Joshua 24:14</a>), against which this Name was a standing protest, since "the Existent" must mean "the Self Existent," and so "the Only Existent." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-39.htm" title="Know therefore this day, and consider it in your heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and on the earth beneath: there is none else.">Deuteronomy 4:39</a> : "Jehovah, he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: <span class= "ital">there is none else"</span>)<p><span class= "bld">By my name Jehovah was I not known to them.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">was I not made manifest to them.</span> The antiquity of the name itself appears--(1) from its derivation, which is from the obsolete <span class= "ital">havah,</span> a form already in the time of Moses superseded by <span class= "ital">hayah;</span> (2) from its occurrence in some of the most ancient documents inserted by Moses into the Book of Genesis, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-4.htm" title="And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.">Exodus 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/2-3.htm" title="And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.">Exodus 2:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/11-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more on Pharaoh, and on Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.">Exodus 11:1-9</a>, &c.; (3) from its employment by Abraham as an element in a name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-14.htm" title="And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.">Genesis 22:14</a>). But though the name was ancient, and known to the patriarchs, its full meaning was not known to them, and so God was not manifested to them by it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty</span>. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a> for the revelation of this name to Abraham, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a> for its repetition to Jacob. We do not find the full name used by God in any appearance to Isaac; but Isaac himself uses it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-3.htm">Genesis 28:3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">By my name Jehovah was</span> <span class="cmt_word">I not known unto them</span>. The explanation of this passage is by no means easy. God himself, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-7.htm">Genesis 15:7</a>, revealed himself to Abraham as Jehovah before declaring his name to be El-Shaddai (God Almighty); and again revealed himself to Jacob as Jehovah-Elohim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13</a>). Abraham named the place where he had been about to sacrifice Isaac, "Jehovah-jireh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-14.htm">Genesis 22:14</a>). That Moses regarded the name as known even earlier, appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-1.htm">Genesis 4:1</a>. It was probably as old as language. The apparent meaning of the present passage cannot therefore be its true meaning. No writer would so contradict himself. Perhaps the true sense is, "I was known to them as a Being of might and power, not as mere absolute (and so eternal and immutable) existence." This meaning of the word, though its etymological and original meaning, may have been unknown to the patriarchs, who were not etymologists. It was first distinctly declared to Moses at Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14, 15</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-9 We are most likely to prosper in attempts to glorify God, and to be useful to men, when we learn by experience that we can do nothing of ourselves; when our whole dependence is placed on him, and our only expectation is from him. Moses had been expecting what God would do; but now he shall see what he will do. God would now be known by his name Jehovah, that is, a God performing what he had promised, and finishing his own work. God intended their happiness: I will take you to me for a people, a peculiar people, and I will be to you a God. More than this we need not ask, we cannot have, to make us happy. He intended his own glory: Ye shall know that I am the Lord. These good words, and comfortable words, should have revived the drooping Israelites, and have made them forget their misery; but they were so taken up with their troubles, that they did not heed God's promises. By indulging discontent and fretfulness, we deprive ourselves of the comfort we might have, both from God's word and from his providence, and go comfortless.</body></html>
