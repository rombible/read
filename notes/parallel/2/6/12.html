He had some difficulty of utterance; but whether or not it was a physical impediment remains uncertain. "Uncircumcised" is used, according to the Hebrew idiom, for any imperfection which interferes with efficiency. An "uncircumcised ear," is explained in Jeremiah 6 to be an ear that "cannot hearken;" and an "uncircumcised heart: (Lev. xxvi 41) is a heart that fails to understand.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Uncircumcised lips</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "lips inefficient for the purpose for which lips are given;" as "uncircumcised ears" are ears that cannot hearken (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-10.htm">Jeremiah 6:10</a>), and an "uncircumcised heart" a heart that cannot understand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-26.htm">Jeremiah 9:26</a>). The meaning is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10</a>, where Moses says that he is "slow of speech and of a slow tongue." Nothing can be determined from the expression as to the exact cause of the imperfection of which complaint is made. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 6:13-27 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:10-13 The faith of Moses was so feeble that he could scarcely be kept to his work. Ready obedience is always according to the strength of our faith. Though our weaknesses ought to humble us, yet they ought not to discourage us from doing our best in any service we have to do for God. When Moses repeats his baffled arguments, he is argued with no longer, but God gives him and Aaron a charge, both to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh. God's authority is sufficient to answer all objections, and binds all to obey, without murmuring or disputing, Php 2:14.</body></html>
