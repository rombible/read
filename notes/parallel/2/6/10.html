He is to enter into his presence once more, and demand, without circumlocution or obscurity, that the Israelites be allowed to quit the land (ver. 11). Moses, however, demurs. He had done God's will with respect to the people readily and at once, expecting <span class="accented">that</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> he had persuaded them before, so he would a second time. But he had been disappointed; the people had refused to listen to him. Immediately all his original self-distrust and diffidence recurred - even the old form of diffidence, distrust of his ability to persuade men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10</a>). How shall he expect to persuade Pharaoh, who had already rejected him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2-5</a>), when he bad just failed with his own countrymen, who previously had "believed" his report (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-31.htm">Exodus 4:31</a>)? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:10-13 The faith of Moses was so feeble that he could scarcely be kept to his work. Ready obedience is always according to the strength of our faith. Though our weaknesses ought to humble us, yet they ought not to discourage us from doing our best in any service we have to do for God. When Moses repeats his baffled arguments, he is argued with no longer, but God gives him and Aaron a charge, both to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh. God's authority is sufficient to answer all objections, and binds all to obey, without murmuring or disputing, Php 2:14.</body></html>
