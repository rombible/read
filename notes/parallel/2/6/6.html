Later on we learn that the redemption was accomplished in a twofold way--(1) by the long series of wonders, culminating in the tenth plague, whereby they were taken out of Pharaoh's hand, and ceased to be his slaves, becoming instead the servants of God; and (2) by being led through the Red Sea, and thus delivered, one and all, from impending death, and so purchased anew. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/15-13.htm" title="You in your mercy have led forth the people which you have redeemed: you have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation.">Exodus 15:13-16</a>.) The delivery from Pharaoh typified <span class= "ital">our</span> deliverance from the power of Satan; the bringing forth from Egypt <span class= "ital">our</span> deliverance from the power of sin.<p><span class= "bld">With a stretched out arm.</span>--See the comment on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-20.htm" title="And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the middle thereof: and after that he will let you go.">Exodus 3:20</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Witn great judgments.</span> ? That the "wonders" to be performed would also be "judgments" is here first declared plainly, though previously hinted at (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-20.htm" title="And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the middle thereof: and after that he will let you go.">Exodus 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-23.htm" title="And I say to you, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if you refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay your son, even your firstborn.">Exodus 4:23</a>). In Genesis God had said that he would "judge" the nation which should afflict Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-14.htm" title="And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.">Genesis 15:14</a>), but not that he would do so miraculously.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Say unto the children of Israel</span>. God felt for the disappointment which the people had suffered in finding no alleviation of their toils, but the reverse, after their hopes had been raised high by the words of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-31.htm">Exodus 4:31</a>). He therefore sent them an inspiriting and gracious message. "They <span class="accented">should</span> be rid of their bondage; they <span class="accented">should</span> be brought out; they <span class="accented">should</span> be redeemed and delivered by his mighty arm and miraculous intervention. He, Jehovah, had said it." Faith would lay hold on this assurance and cling to it, even though God still delayed his coming, and did not precipitate matters. <span class="cmt_word">A stretched-out arm</span>. Arms are stretched out by men to help and save. An outstretched arm in the Egyptian writing meant "action." The phrase, elsewhere so common, is here used for the first time. (Compare, however, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>.) It was significant of active, energetic help. <span class="cmt_word">Great judgments</span>. These had been previously hinted at (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>) but had not been previously called "judgments." Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-14.htm">Genesis 15:14</a>: "Also that nation whom they serve will I judge." The plagues of Egypt were not merely "wonders," but punishments inflicted on a proud and cruel nation by a Judge. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-9 We are most likely to prosper in attempts to glorify God, and to be useful to men, when we learn by experience that we can do nothing of ourselves; when our whole dependence is placed on him, and our only expectation is from him. Moses had been expecting what God would do; but now he shall see what he will do. God would now be known by his name Jehovah, that is, a God performing what he had promised, and finishing his own work. God intended their happiness: I will take you to me for a people, a peculiar people, and I will be to you a God. More than this we need not ask, we cannot have, to make us happy. He intended his own glory: Ye shall know that I am the Lord. These good words, and comfortable words, should have revived the drooping Israelites, and have made them forget their misery; but they were so taken up with their troubles, that they did not heed God's promises. By indulging discontent and fretfulness, we deprive ourselves of the comfort we might have, both from God's word and from his providence, and go comfortless.</body></html>
