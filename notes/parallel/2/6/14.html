They occupy quite as prominent a position in Arabian as in Jewish history. The descent of a man who aspired to be a leader would be a subject of curiosity, with a Semitic people, to all those who submitted themselves to his guidance; and Moses naturally inserts his at the point where, fully accepting the post of leader, he came forward and commenced his struggle with Pharaoh for the emancipation of his nation. A "father's house" is a family.

As, however, the writer is really concerned only with the Levites, the families of Reuben and Simeon are dismissed with the briefest possible notice. Nothing new is rocorded of them. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/46-9.htm" title="And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.">Genesis 46:9-10</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These be the heads of their fathers' houses</span>. By "fathers' houses" are meant families (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-38.htm">1 Chronicles 4:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-13.htm">1 Chronicles 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-40.htm">1 Chronicles 7:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-9.htm">1 Chronicles 9:9</a>, etc.); and "the heads of fathers' houses" are simply the acknowledged chiefs and founders of families. The main families of the tribe of Reuben were those of Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carrel, actual sons of the patriarch (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-9.htm">Genesis 46:9</a>; and compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-3.htm">1 Chronicles 5:3</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:14-30 Moses and Aaron were Israelites; raised up unto them of their brethren, as Christ also should be, who was to be the Prophet and Priest, the Redeemer and Lawgiver of the people of Israel. Moses returns to his narrative, and repeats the charge God had given him to deliver his message to Pharaoh, and his objection against it. Those who have spoken unadvisedly with their lips ought to reflect upon it with regret, as Moses seems to do here.Uncircumcised, is used in Scripture to note the unsuitableness there may be in any thing to answer its proper purpose; as the carnal heart and depraved nature of fallen man are wholly unsuited to the services of God, and to the purposes of his glory. It is profitable to place no confidence in ourselves, all our sufficiency must be in the Lord. We never can trust ourselves too little, or our God too much. I can do nothing by myself, said the apostle, but I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</body></html>
