At Rome it was common for slaves to endure the severest torture rather than betray or accuse their owners. If a man has no rights, he is thankful for small mercies, and responds with warm feeling to those who treat him kindly. As the Hebrew form of slavery was of a mild type, masters being admonished to treat their slaves "not as bondservants, but as hired servants" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/25-39.htm" title="And if your brother that dwells by you be waxen poor, and be sold to you; you shall not compel him to serve as a bondservant:">Leviticus 25:39-40</a>), and, again, "not to rule over them with rigour" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-46.htm" title="And you shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your slaves for ever: but over your brothers the children of Israel, you shall not rule one over another with rigor.">Leviticus 25:46</a>), there would naturally be frequent cases where the slave would not wish to "go out." He might actually "love his master;" or he might value the security from want which attaches to the slave condition; or he might be unwilling to break up the family which, by his master's favour, he had been allowed to create. For such cases some provision was necessary. It was made by the law here formulated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/21-5.htm" title="And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:">Exodus 21:5-6</a>), which allowed the Hebrew slave, if he liked, to forfeit all claim to freedom, and take upon him permanently the condition of a bondman.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I love my master</span>, etc. Affection might grow up between the slave and the master, if he were well treated. The Hebrew form of slavery was altogether of a mild kind. Masters are admonished to treat their slaves "not as bond-servants, but as hired servants or sojourners," and again "not to rule over them with rigour" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39, 40, 43</a>). Even among the heathen, slaves often bore a true affection to their masters. Or, the slave might be so attached to his wife and children as to be unwilling to separate from them, and might prefer slavery with the solace of their society to freedom without it. For such cases the provision was made, which is contained in ver. 6. On the slave declaring to his master his unwillingness to go free, the master might take him before the judges, or magistrates (literally "gods") as witnesses, and perhaps registrars of the man' s declaration, and might then reconduct him to his house, and by a significant ceremony mark him as his slave "for ever." The ceremony consisted in boring through one of his ears with an awl, and driving the awl into the door or doorpost of the house, thereby attaching him physically to the dwelling of which he became thenceforth a permanent inmate. Almost all commentators assert that some such custom was common in the East in connection with slavery, and refer to Xen. Aaab. 3:1, &sect; 31; Plant. <span class="accented">Poenul</span>. 5:2, 21; Juv. Sat. 1:104; Plutarch. <span class="accented">Vit</span>. <span class="accented">Cic</span>. &sect; 26, etc. But these passages merely show that the Orientals generally - not slaves in particular - had their ears bored for the purpose of wearing earrings, and indicate no usage at all comparable to the Hebrew practice. The Hebrew custom - probably a very ancient one - seems to have had two objects - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The declaring by a significant act, that the man belonged to the house; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The permanent marking of him as a slave, dis-entitled to the rights of freemen, <span class="cmt_word">he shall serve him for ever</span>. Josephus (<span class="accented">Ant. Jud.</span> 4:8, &sect; 20) and the Jewish commentators generally maintain that the law of the jubilee release overruled this enactment; but this must be regarded as very doubtful. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-11 The laws in this chapter relate to the fifth and sixth commandments; and though they differ from our times and customs, nor are they binding on us, yet they explain the moral law, and the rules of natural justice. The servant, in the state of servitude, was an emblem of that state of bondage to sin, Satan, and the law, which man is brought into by robbing God of his glory, by the transgression of his precepts. Likewise in being made free, he was an emblem of that liberty wherewith Christ, the Son of God, makes free from bondage his people, who are free indeed; and made so freely, without money and without price, of free grace.</body></html>
