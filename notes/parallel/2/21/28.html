Protection from both was needed. The law given to Noah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-5.htm" title="And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.">Genesis 9:5</a>) had already laid it down that whenever a beast killed a man his life was to be forfeit. This law was now re-enacted, but with a further and very important proviso. If the animal had an owner, and the owner had reason to know that it was dangerous, then not only the beast, but the owner also was to be held guilty. He was to be liable to a process for murder (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-29.htm" title="But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it has been testified to his owner, and he has not kept him in, but that he has killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.">Exodus 21:29</a>); but, with the consent of the aggrieved family, might pay a sum of money as compensation instead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-30.htm" title="If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatever is laid on him.">Exodus 21:30</a>). In the case of a slave, the sum was fixed at what was regarded as the standard price of a slave (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/25-44.htm" title="Both your slaves, and your bondmaids, which you shall have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall you buy slaves and bondmaids.">Leviticus 25:44-46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-3.htm" title="And your estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even your estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.">Leviticus 27:3</a>), viz., thirty silver shekels.<p>(28) <span class= "bld">The ox shall be surely stoned</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>he shall die the death of a murderer.<p><span class= "bld">His flesh shall not be eaten.</span>--An ox killed by stoning would not be bled in the usual way, and would be "unclean" food for Hebrews. According to the Rabbis, the flesh might not even be disposed of to the Gentiles, but had to be buried. If this were so, the object must have been to mark strongly that whatever creature took human life was accursed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28-32.</span> - <span class="accented">Injuries done by cattle to slaves and freemen</span>. For the purpose of inculcating as strongly as possible the principle of the sanctity of human life, the legislator notices the case where mortal injury is done to a person by a domesticated animal. The ox is taken as the example, being the animal most likely to inflict such an injury. In accordance with the declaration already made to Noah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>), it is laid down that the destructive beast must be killed. Further, to mark the abhorrence in which murder ought to be held, the provision is made, that none of the creature' s flesh must be eaten. The question then arises, is the owner to suffer any punishment? This is answered in the way that natural equity points out - "If he had reason to know the savage temper of the animal, he is to he held responsible; if otherwise, he is to go free." In the former case, the Hebrew law assigned a higher degree of responsibility than accords with modern notions; but practically the result was not very different. The neglectful Hebrew owner was held to have been guilty of a capital offence, but was allowed to "redeem his life" by a fine. His modern counterpart would be held to have been guilty simply of <span class="accented">laches</span> or neglect of duty, and would be punished by fine or imprisonment <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ox shall be surely stoned.</span> He shall suffer the same death that would have been the portion of a human murderer. <span class="cmt_word">His flesh shall not be eaten</span>. The animal was regarded as accursed, and therefore, as a matter of course, no Hebrew might eat of it. According to the Rabbinical commentators, it was not even lawful to sell the carcase to Gentiles. <span class="cmt_word">The owner shall be quit</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "shall be liable to no punishment." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:22-36 The cases here mentioned give rules of justice then, and still in use, for deciding similar matters. We are taught by these laws, that we must be very careful to do no wrong, either directly or indirectly. If we have done wrong, we must be very willing to make it good, and be desirous that nobody may lose by us.</body></html>
