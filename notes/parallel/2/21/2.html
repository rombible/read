"The ultimate elements of the household," says Aristotle, "are the master and his slave, the husband and his wife, the father and his children" (<span class= "ital">Pol. i.</span> 2, ? 1). In any consideration of the rights of persons, those of the slave class naturally presented themselves first of all, since they were the most liable to infraction. Slaves might be either natives or foreigners. A Hebrew could become a slave--(1) through crime (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-3.htm" title="If the sun be risen on him, there shall be blood shed for him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.">Exodus 22:3</a>); (2) through indebtedness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-39.htm" title="And if your brother that dwells by you be waxen poor, and be sold to you; you shall not compel him to serve as a bondservant:">Leviticus 25:39</a>); (3) through his father's right to sell him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-5.htm" title="Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children: and, see, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought to bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.">Nehemiah 5:5</a>). Foreign slaves might be either prisoners taken in war, or persons bought of their owners (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-45.htm" title="Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall you buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.">Leviticus 25:45</a>). The rights of Hebrew slaves are here specially considered.<p><span class= "bld">Six years shall he serve.</span>--The Hebrew was not to be retained in slavery for a longer space than six years. If a jubilee year occurred before the end of the six years, then he regained his freedom earlier (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/25-39.htm" title="And if your brother that dwells by you be waxen poor, and be sold to you; you shall not compel him to serve as a bondservant:">Leviticus 25:39-41</a>); but in no case could he be retained more than six years in the slave condition, except by his own consent, formally given (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-5.htm" title="And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:">Exodus 21:5</a>). This law was an enormous advance upon anything previously known in the slave legislation of the most civilised country, and stamps the Mosaic code at once as sympathising with the slave, and bent on ameliorating his lot. It has been thought strange by some that slavery was not now abrogated; but even Christianity, fifteen hundred years later, did not venture on so complete a social revolution.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> ? <span class="cmt_word">If thou buy an Hebrew servant</span>. Slavery, it is clear, was an existing institution. The law of Moses did not make it, but found it, and by not forbidding, allowed it. The Divine legislator was content under the circumstances to introduce mitigations and alleviations into the slave condition. Hebrews commonly became slaves through poverty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35, 39</a>), but sometimes through crime (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-3.htm">Exodus 22:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In</span> <span class="cmt_word">the seventh he shall go out.</span> Not in the Sabbatical year, but at the commencement of the seventh year after he became a slave. If the jubilee year happened to occur, he might be released sooner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-40.htm">Leviticus 25:40</a>); but in any case his servitude must end when the sixth year of it was completed. This was an enormous boon, and had nothing, so far as is known, correspondent to it in the legislation of any other country. Nor was this all. When he went out free, his late master was bound to furnish him with provisions out of his flock, and out of his threshing floor, and out of his winepress (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12-14</a>), so that he might have something wherewith to begin the world afresh. The humane spirit of the legislation is strikingly marked in its very first enactment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-11 The laws in this chapter relate to the fifth and sixth commandments; and though they differ from our times and customs, nor are they binding on us, yet they explain the moral law, and the rules of natural justice. The servant, in the state of servitude, was an emblem of that state of bondage to sin, Satan, and the law, which man is brought into by robbing God of his glory, by the transgression of his precepts. Likewise in being made free, he was an emblem of that liberty wherewith Christ, the Son of God, makes free from bondage his people, who are free indeed; and made so freely, without money and without price, of free grace.</body></html>
