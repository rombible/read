(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/8-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 8:1-13</a>.) Moses perhaps found that there was not time for the completion of the ceremony on the day of the erection of the Tabernacle, and therefore deferred a part of it.<p>(9) <span class= "bld">The anointing oil.</span>--Directions for the composition of the oil had been already given (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/30-23.htm" title="Take you also to you principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,">Exodus 30:23-25</a>); and at the same time it had been ordered that the Tabernacle, the ark, the table, the candlestick, the two altars, the laver, and the various vessels of the sanctuary, should be consecrated by anointing them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/30-26.htm" title="And you shall anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony,">Exodus 30:26-29</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-16.</span> - <span class="accented">The directions to anoint</span>, etc. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-16.</span> - It does not appear that these directions were carried out at this time. Probably, there would not have been time to go through all the ceremonies enjoined (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1-34</a>) on the same day with the erection of the sanctuary. They were consequently deferred, either till the next day, or possibly to a later date. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8.htm">Leviticus 8</a>.) The anointing of the tabernacle is recorded in ver. 10; of the vessels in ver. 11; of the altar and laver in the same. The washing of Aaron and his sons in ver. 6; their investiture in vers. 7-9; the anointing of Aaron in ver. 12; and a further anointing of Aaron together with his sons in ver. 30. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:1-15 When a new year begins, we should seek to serve God better than the year before. In half a year the tabernacle was completed. When the hearts of numbers are earnest in a good cause, much may be done in a short time; and when the commandments of God are continually attended to, as the rule of working, all will be done well. The high-priesthood was in the family of Aaron till Christ came, and in Him, the substance of all these shadows, it continues for ever.</body></html>
