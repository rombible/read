The work was finished the fist incense burnt (ver. 27) - the first sacrifice offered (ver. 29). Those who had watched the proceedings, and those who had been engaged in them, were probably about to retire to rest. Even Moses had withdrawn, and left the tabernacle to itself - when suddenly, there was a manifestation of Divine Power. The cloud, which had gone before the Israelites from Succoth onward (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-20.htm">Exodus 13:20-22</a>), and which had recently settled upon the extemporised "Tent of Meeting" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-9.htm">Exodus 33:9</a>), left its place, and "covered" the newly-erected structure externally (ver. 34), while an intensely brilliant light - here called "the glory of God" - filled the whole interior of the tabernacle (<span class="accented">ib</span>,). Moses, it appears, would fain have re-entered the tabernacle - to see the great sight" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-3.htm">Exodus 3:3</a>); but he could not - the "glory" was too dazzling (ver. 35). Thus a distinct approval was given to all that had been done. God accepted his house, and entered it. The people saw that he had foregone his wrath, and would be content henceforth to dwell among them and journey with them. Henceforth, throughout the wanderings, the cloud and tabernacle were inseparable. If the cloud was lifted a little off it and moved in front, the tabernacle had to follow (ver. 36) - if it settled down on the roof, the people stopped and remained until it moved again (ver. 37). The appearance was as of a cloud by day, and as of fire by night, so that all could always see where the tabernacle was, and whether it was stationary or in motion (ver. 38). After the first descent, it would seem that "the glory" withdrew into the Holy of Holies, so that both Moses and the priests could enter the holy place, and minister there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-13.htm">Leviticus 10:13</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then a cloud</span>.

Entered inside, and filled both holy place and Holy of Holies. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:34-38 The cloud covered the tabernacle even in the clearest day; it was not a cloud which the sun scatters. This cloud was a token of God's presence to be seen day and night, by all Israel, that they might never again question, Is the Lord among us, or is he not? It guided the camp of Israel through the wilderness. While the cloud rested on the tabernacle, they rested; when it removed, they followed it. The glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. In light and fire the Shechinah made itself visible: God is Light; our God is a consuming Fire. Yet so dazzling was the light, and so dreadful the fire, that Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, till the splendour was abated. But what Moses could not do, our Lord Jesus has done, whom God caused to draw near; and who has invited us to come boldly, even to the mercy-seat. Being taught by the Holy Spirit to follow the example of Christ, as well as to depend upon him, to attend his ordinances, and obey his precepts, we shall be kept from losing our way, and be led in the midst of the paths of judgment, till we come to heaven, the habitation of his holiness. BLESSED BE GOD FOR JESUS CHRIST!</body></html>
