As a cloud it rested upon it by day; as a pillar of fire by night. Only in one case was it removed, viz., when it was the Divine will that Israel should march. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/9-15.htm" title="And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was on the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.">Numbers 9:15-22</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">#define description=DESC<p>#define abbreviation=ABBR<p>#define comments=CMTS<p>#define version=3<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 36-38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "whensoever." The last three verses describe the manner in which the cloud henceforth served the Israelites as guide - not only directing their course, but determining when they were to move, and how long they were to rest at each encampment. For a further account of the same, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15-23</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:34-38 The cloud covered the tabernacle even in the clearest day; it was not a cloud which the sun scatters. This cloud was a token of God's presence to be seen day and night, by all Israel, that they might never again question, Is the Lord among us, or is he not? It guided the camp of Israel through the wilderness. While the cloud rested on the tabernacle, they rested; when it removed, they followed it. The glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. In light and fire the Shechinah made itself visible: God is Light; our God is a consuming Fire. Yet so dazzling was the light, and so dreadful the fire, that Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, till the splendour was abated. But what Moses could not do, our Lord Jesus has done, whom God caused to draw near; and who has invited us to come boldly, even to the mercy-seat. Being taught by the Holy Spirit to follow the example of Christ, as well as to depend upon him, to attend his ordinances, and obey his precepts, we shall be kept from losing our way, and be led in the midst of the paths of judgment, till we come to heaven, the habitation of his holiness. BLESSED BE GOD FOR JESUS CHRIST!</body></html>
