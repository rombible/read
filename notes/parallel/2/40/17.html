The erection of the framework, and the stretching upon it of the fine linen and goats'-hair coverings, must have been the main difficulty. But the family of Abraham had been familiar with tent life from the time of its quitting Ur of the Chaldees to the descent into Egypt, and its location in Egypt on the borders of the desert, in close neighbourhood to various nomadic races, had kept up its familiarity with tents, their structure, and the most approved methods of pitching and striking them. Thus it is not surprisiug that the first erection was completed in less than a day.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-33.</span> - <span class="accented">The actual setting up of the tabernacle</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the first day the tabernacle was reared up</span>. Being constructed after the fashion of a tent, it was quite possible to rear up and also to take down, the tabernacle in less than a day. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:16-33 When the tabernacle and the furniture of it were prepared, they did not put off rearing it till they came to Canaan; but, in obedience to the will of God, they set it up in the midst of their camp. Those who are unsettled in the world, must not think that this will excuse want of religion; as if it were enough to begin to serve God when they begin to be settled in the world. No; a tabernacle for God is very needful, even in a wilderness, especially as we may be in another world before we come to fix in this. And we may justly fear lest we should deceive ourselves with a form of godliness. The thought that so few entered Canaan, should warn young persons especially, not to put off the care of their souls.</body></html>
