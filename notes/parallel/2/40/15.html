He had the oil poured over his head (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-12.htm" title="And he poured of the anointing oil on Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.">Leviticus 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/133-2.htm" title="It is like the precious ointment on the head, that ran down on the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;">Psalm 133:2</a>). They were merely sprinkled with a mixture of oil and blood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-30.htm" title="And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.">Leviticus 8:30</a>). The difference implied a lower degree of official holiness.<p><span class= "bld">Their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood.</span>--The Jewish commentators maintain that the one anointing of the sons of Aaron sufficed for all time, and was not repeated in the case of any subsequent priests, who became fully possessed of the sacerdotal office without it. Each high priest was, on the contrary, inducted into his office by anointing, whence the high priest came to be spoken of as "the anointed priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-3.htm" title="If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he has sinned, a young bullock without blemish to the LORD for a sin offering.">Leviticus 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-5.htm" title="And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:">Leviticus 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-16.htm" title="And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:">Leviticus 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-12.htm" title="Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is on him: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 21:12</a>, &c.).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt anoint them as thou didst anoint</span> <span class="cmt_word">their father.</span> The mode of anointing does not seem to have been identical in the two cases. The oil was first poured upon Aaron's head (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-12.htm">Leviticus 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/133-2.htm">Psalm 133:2</a>), and afterwards sprinkled upon him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-30.htm">Leviticus 8:30</a>). It was, apparently, only sprinkled upon the priests (<span class="accented">ib</span>,). This was a lower form of anointing; and hence the high priest was sometimes called "<span class="accented">the</span> anointed priest" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-5.htm">Leviticus 4:5, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-22.htm">Leviticus 6:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-32.htm">Leviticus 16:32</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood.</span> The Rabbinical commentators maintain that these words apply to the ordinary priests only, and on the strength of them establish a difference between the ordinary priests and the high priests. The latter were in every ease to be anointed to their office. A single anointing sainted for the former. It is scarcely necessary to say that there is no Scriptural ground for this distinction. The natural sense of the words is, rather, that as long as the anointing continued, the priesthood should continue. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:1-15 When a new year begins, we should seek to serve God better than the year before. In half a year the tabernacle was completed. When the hearts of numbers are earnest in a good cause, much may be done in a short time; and when the commandments of God are continually attended to, as the rule of working, all will be done well. The high-priesthood was in the family of Aaron till Christ came, and in Him, the substance of all these shadows, it continues for ever.</body></html>
