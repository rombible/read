If a man sees his enemy's ass prostrate under its burthen, he is to help to raise it up. In this case he owes a double duty--(1) to his enemy, and (2) to the suffering animal. Geddes' emendation of <span class= "ital">'azar </span>for '<span class= "ital">azab, </span>in all the three places where the verb occurs, is the simplest and best of those suggested.

Many renderings have been suggested; but it is not clear that any one of them is an improvement on the Authorised Version. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt surely help with him</span>. The joint participation in an act of mercy towards a fallen beast would bring the enemies into friendly contact, and soften their feelings towards each other. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-9 In the law of Moses are very plain marks of sound moral feeling, and of true political wisdom. Every thing in it is suited to the desired and avowed object, the worship of one only God, and the separation of Israel from the pagan world. Neither parties, friends, witnesses, nor common opinions, must move us to lessen great faults, to aggravate small ones, excuse offenders, accuse the innocent, or misrepresent any thing.</body></html>
