It is impossible, however, to understand this passage in any other way than as an assignment to Israel of the entire tract between the Desert, or "Wilderness of the Wanderings," and the Euphrates on the one hand, the Mediterranean and the Red Sea on the other. "The River" (<span class= "ital">han-nahar</span>) has no other meaning in the Pentateuch than "the Euphrates." And this was exactly the extent to which the dominions of Israel reached under Solomon, as we see from the description in Kings and Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm" title="And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.">1Kings 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-24.htm" title="For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.">1Kings 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-26.htm" title="And he reigned over all the kings from the river even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.">2Chronicles 9:26</a>). It had, according to Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm" title="In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To your seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:">Genesis 15:18</a>), been already indicated with tolerable precision in the original promise made to Abraham.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I will set thy bounds from the Red Sea even unto the sea of the Philistines</span>. This passage by itself would be sufficient to confute Dr. Brugsch's notion, that the Yam Suph (or "Red Sea" of our translators) is the Lake Serbonis, which is a part of the Mediterranean or "Sea of the Philistines," and cannot stand in contrast with it. The "Sea of the Philistines" and the "Red Sea" mark the boundaries of the Holy Land East and West, as the "Desert" and the "River" (Euphrates) do its boundaries North and South. That Moses here lays down those wide limits which were only reached 400 years later, in the time of David and Solomon, and were then speedily lost, can surprise no one who believes in the prophetic gift, and regards Moses as one of the greatest of the Prophets. The tract marked out by these limits had been already promised to Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>). Its possession by Solomon is distinctly recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-26.htm">2 Chronicles 9:26</a>. As Solomon was "a man of peace," we must ascribe the acquisition of this wide empire to David. (Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6-19</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">The river</span> (<span class="accented">han</span>-<span class="accented">nahar</span>) is in the Pentateuch always the Euphrates. The Nile is <span class="accented">ha-y' or</span>. A powerful kingdom established in Syria is almost sure to extend its influence to the Euphrates. <span class="cmt_word">I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand</span>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-44.htm">Joshua 21:44</a>, for the first fulfilment of this prophecy. Its complete fulfilment was reserved for the time of David. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt drive them out</span>. The mass of the Canaanites were no doubt "driven out" rather than exterminated. They retired northwards, and gave strength to the great Hittite kingdom which was for many centuries a formidable antagomst of the Egyptian and Assyrian empties. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 23:32-33 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:20-33 It is here promised that they should be guided and kept in their way through the wilderness to the land of promise, Behold, I send an angel before thee, mine angel. The precept joined with this promise is, that they be obedient to this angel whom God would send before them. Christ is the Angel of Jehovah; this is plainly taught by St. Paul, 1Co 10:9. They should have a comfortable settlement in the land of Canaan. How reasonable are the conditions of this promise; that they should serve the only true God; not the gods of the nations, which are no gods at all. How rich are the particulars of this promise! The comfort of their food, the continuance of their health, the increase of their wealth, the prolonging their lives to old age. Thus hath godliness the promise of the life that now is. It is promised that they should subdue their enemies. Hosts of hornets made way for the hosts of Israel; such mean creatures can God use for chastising his people's enemies. In real kindness to the church, its enemies are subdued by little and little; thus we are kept on our guard, and in continual dependence on God. Corruptions are driven out of the hearts of God's people, not all at once, but by little and little. The precept with this promise is, that they should not make friendship with idolaters. Those that would keep from bad courses, must keep from bad company. It is dangerous to live in a bad neighbourhood; others' sins will be our snares. Our greatest danger is from those who would make us sin against God.</body></html>
