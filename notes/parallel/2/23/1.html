You shall not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.">Exodus 23:19</a> there is, on the contrary, a certain connection, since the laws enunciated are concerned with ceremonial observance. The closing law, however, is not ceremonial, but the prohibition of a practice considered to be cruel. On the whole, it may be said that The Book of the Covenant maintains its unsystematic character to the close. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/20-22.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, You have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.">Exodus 20:22-26</a>.)<p>(1) Thou shalt not raise a false report.--The LXX. and Vulg. Translate, "Thou shalt not <span class= "ital">receive </span>a false report"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>give it credit, accept it as true, and act upon it. This meaning accords well with the succeeding clause, which forbids our giving support to the false testimony of others. In both clauses the principle of the ninth commandment is extended from principals to accessories.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The ninth commandment is here expanded and developed. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not raise a false report</span>, forbids the origination of a calumny; the other clause prohibits the joining with others in spreading one. Both clauses have a special reference to bearing witness in a court, but neither would seem to be confined to it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-9 In the law of Moses are very plain marks of sound moral feeling, and of true political wisdom. Every thing in it is suited to the desired and avowed object, the worship of one only God, and the separation of Israel from the pagan world. Neither parties, friends, witnesses, nor common opinions, must move us to lessen great faults, to aggravate small ones, excuse offenders, accuse the innocent, or misrepresent any thing.</body></html>
