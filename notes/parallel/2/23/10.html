It is most extraordinary that any legislator should have been able to induce a people to accept such a law. <span class= "ital">Prima facie, </span>it seemed, by forbidding productive industry during one year in seven, to diminish the wealth of the nation by one-seventh. But it is questionable whether, under a primitive agricultural system, when rotation of crops was unknown, the lying of the land fallow during one year in seven would not have been an economical benefit. There was no prohibition on labour other than in cultivation. The clearing away of weeds and thorns and stones was allowed, and may have been practised. After an early harvest of the self-sown crop, the greater part of the year may have been spent in this kind of industry. Still the enactment was no doubt unpopular: it checked the regular course of agriculture, and seemed to rob landowners of one-seventh of their natural gains. Accordingly, we find that it was very irregularly observed. Between the Exodus and the Captivity it had apparently been neglected seventy times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-21.htm" title="To fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfill three score and ten years.">2Chronicles 36:21</a>), or more often than it had been kept. After the Captivity, however, the observance became regular, and classical writers notice the custom as one existing in their day (Tacit. <span class= "ital">Hist. v.</span> 4). Julius Caesar permitted it, and excused the Jews from paying tribute in the seventh year on its account (Joseph., <span class= "ital">Ant Jud. </span>xiv. 10, ? 6). The object of the law was threefold--(1) to test obedience; (2) to give an advantage to the poor and needy, to whom the crop of the seventh year belonged (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-11.htm" title="But the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie still; that the poor of your people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner you shall deal with your vineyard, and with your olive grove.">Exodus 23:11</a>); and (3) to allow an opportunity, once in seven years, for prolonged communion with God and increased religious observances. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/31-10.htm" title="And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,">Deuteronomy 31:10-13</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="accented">Law of the Sabbatical year</span>. Days of rest, at regular or irregular intervals, were well known to the ancients and some regulations of the kind existed in most countries But entire years of rest were wholly unknown to any nation except the Israelites. and exposed them to the reproach of idleness. (See Tacit. <span class="accented">Hist</span>. 5:4: - "Septimo die otium placuisse ferunt, quia is finem laborum dedit; dein, <span class="accented">blandiente inertia</span>, septimum quoque annum ignaviae datum"). In a primitive condition of agriculture, when rotation of crops was unknown, artificial manure unemployed, and the need of letting even the best land sometimes lie fallow unrecognised, it may not have been an uneconomical arrangement to require an entire suspension of cultivation once in seven years. But great difficulty was probably experienced in enforcing the law. Just as there were persons who wished to gather manna on the seventh day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-27.htm">Exodus 16:27</a>), so there would be many anxious to obtain in the seventh year something more from their fields than Nature would give them if left to herself. If the "seventy years" of the captivity were intended exactly to make up for omissions of the due observance of the sabbatical year, we must suppose that between the time of the exodus and the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, the ordinance had been as often neglected as observed. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>.) The primary object of the requirement was, as stated in ver. 11, <span class="cmt_word">that the poor of thy people may eat</span>, what the land brought forth of its own accord in the Sabbatical year being shared by them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-6.htm">Leviticus 25:6</a>.). But no doubt it was also intended that the Sabbatical year should be one of increased religious observance, whereof the solemn reading of the law in the ears of the people at the Feast of Tabernacles "in the year of release" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-10.htm">Deuteronomy 31:10</a>) was an indication and a part. That reading was properly preceded by a time of religious preparation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1-15</a>), and would naturally lead on to further acts of a religious character, which might occupy a considerable period (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> chs. 9. and 10.). Altogether, the year was a most solemn period, calling men to religious self-examination, to repentance, to the formation of holy habits, and tending to a general elevation among the people of the standard of holiness. <span class="cmt_word">What they leave the beasts of the field shall eat</span>. There was to be no regular ingathering. The proprietor, his servants, the poor, and the stranger were to take what they needed; and the residue was to be for the cattle and for the beasts that were in the land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-6.htm">Deuteronomy 25:6, 7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thy vineyard - thy oliveyard</span>. Corn, wine, and oil were the only important products of Palestine; and this mention of the vineyard and the oliveyard shows that one and the same law was to hold good of all the lands in the country, however they might be cultivated. The whole land was to rest. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:10-19 Every seventh year the land was to rest. They must not plough or sow it; what the earth produced of itself, should be eaten, and not laid up. This law seems to have been intended to teach dependence on Providence, and God's faithfulness in sending the larger increase while they kept his appointments. It was also typical of the heavenly rest, when all earthly labours, cares, and interests shall cease for ever. All respect to the gods of the heathen is strictly forbidden. Since idolatry was a sin to which the Israelites leaned, they must blot out the remembrance of the gods of the heathen. Solemn religious attendance on God, in the place which he should choose, is strictly required. They must come together before the Lord. What a good Master do we serve, who has made it our duty to rejoice before him! Let us devote with pleasure to the service of God that portion of our time which he requires, and count his sabbaths and ordinances to be a feast unto our souls. They were not to come empty-handed; so now, we must not come to worship God empty-hearted; our souls must be filled with holy desires toward him, and dedications of ourselves to him; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</body></html>
