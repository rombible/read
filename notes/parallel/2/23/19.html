To support this theory it is suggested that the command has reference to a superstitious practice customary at the close of the harvest--a kid being then boiled in its mother's milk with magic rites, and the milk used to sprinkle plantations, fields, and gardens, in order to render them more productive the next year. But <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-21.htm" title="You shall not eat of anything that dies of itself: you shall give it to the stranger that is in your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to an alien: for you are an holy people to the LORD your God. You shall not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.">Deuteronomy 14:21</a>, which attaches the precept to a list of unclean meats, is sufficient to show that the kid spoken of was boiled to be eaten. The best explanation of the passage is that of Bochart (<span class= "ital">Hierozoic. </span>pt. 1, bk. 2, Exo. 52), that there was a sort of cruelty in making the milk of the mother, intended for the kid's sustenance, the means of its destruction.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="accented">Law of first-fruits</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The first of the first-fruits</span> may mean either "the best of the first-fruits" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-12.htm">Numbers 18:12</a>), or "the very first of each kind that is ripe" (<span class="accented">ib</span>, verse 13). On the tendency to delay, and not bring the very first, see the comment on Exodus 22:29. <span class="cmt_word">The house of the Lord</span>. Generally, in the Pentateuch we have the periphrasis" the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to put his name there" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5, 11, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-2.htm">Deuteronomy 26:2</a>, etc.); but here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-26.htm">Exodus 34:26</a>, and again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-18.htm">Deuteronomy 23:18</a>, this "place" is plainly declared to be a "house" or "temple." <span class="accented">Law against seething a kid in the mother's milk</span>. The outline of law put before the Israelites in the "Book of the Covenant" terminated with this remarkable prohibition. Its importance is shown - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> By its place here; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> By its being thrice repeated in the law of Moses (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-26.htm">Exodus 34:26</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-21.htm">Deuteronomy 14:21</a>). Various explanations have been given of it; but none is saris-factory, except that which views it as "a protest against cruelty, and outraging the order of nature," more especially that peculiarly sacred portion of nature's order, the tender relation between parent and child, mother and suckling. No doubt the practice existed. Kids were thought to be most palatable when boiled in milk; and the mother's milk was frequently the readiest to obtain. But in this way the mother was made a sort of accomplice in the death of her child, which men were induced to kill on account of the flavour that her milk gave it. Reason has nothing to say against such a mode of preparing food, but feeling revolts from it; and the general sense of civilised mankind reechoes the precept, which is capable of a wide application - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not seethe a kind in his mother's milk.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 23:20-31 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:10-19 Every seventh year the land was to rest. They must not plough or sow it; what the earth produced of itself, should be eaten, and not laid up. This law seems to have been intended to teach dependence on Providence, and God's faithfulness in sending the larger increase while they kept his appointments. It was also typical of the heavenly rest, when all earthly labours, cares, and interests shall cease for ever. All respect to the gods of the heathen is strictly forbidden. Since idolatry was a sin to which the Israelites leaned, they must blot out the remembrance of the gods of the heathen. Solemn religious attendance on God, in the place which he should choose, is strictly required. They must come together before the Lord. What a good Master do we serve, who has made it our duty to rejoice before him! Let us devote with pleasure to the service of God that portion of our time which he requires, and count his sabbaths and ordinances to be a feast unto our souls. They were not to come empty-handed; so now, we must not come to worship God empty-hearted; our souls must be filled with holy desires toward him, and dedications of ourselves to him; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</body></html>
