The legislator extends this duty to cases where the owner is our personal enemy. It was not generally recognised in antiquity that men's enemies had any claims upon them. Cicero, indeed, says--"Sunt autem quaedam officia etiam adversus eos servanda, a quibus injuriam aceeperis" (<span class= "ital">De Off. i.</span> 11); but he stops short of enjoining active benevolence. Here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-5.htm" title="If you see the ass of him that hates you lying under his burden, and would forbear to help him, you shall surely help with him.">Exodus 23:5</a> we have a sort of anticipation of Christianity--active kindness to an enemy being required, even when it costs us some trouble. The principle of friendliness is involved--the germ which in Christianity blossoms out into the precept, "Love your enemies."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thine enemy's ox</span>. A private enemy is here spoken of, not a public one, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-6.htm">Deuteronomy 23:6</a>. It is remarkable that the law should have so far anticipated Christianity as to have laid it down that men have duties of friendliness even towards their enemies, and are bound under certain circumstances to render them a service. "Hate thine enemies" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-43.htm">Matthew 5:43</a>) was no injunction of the Mosaic taw, but a conclusion which Rabbinical teachers unwarrantably drew from it. Christianity, however, goes far beyond Mosaism in laying down the broad precept - "Love your enemies." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-9 In the law of Moses are very plain marks of sound moral feeling, and of true political wisdom. Every thing in it is suited to the desired and avowed object, the worship of one only God, and the separation of Israel from the pagan world. Neither parties, friends, witnesses, nor common opinions, must move us to lessen great faults, to aggravate small ones, excuse offenders, accuse the innocent, or misrepresent any thing.</body></html>
