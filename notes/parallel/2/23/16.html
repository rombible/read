On this fiftieth day (Pentecost) the second festival was to commence by the offering of two loaves made of the new wheat just gathered in. On the other offerings commanded, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/23-18.htm" title="And you shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for a burnt offering to the LORD, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet smell to the LORD.">Leviticus 23:18-20</a>. The Law limited the feast to a single day--the "day of Pentecost"--but in practice it was early extended to two days, in order to cover a possible miscalculation as to the exact time.<p><span class= "bld">The feast of ingathering.</span>--Elsewhere commonly called "the feast of tabernacles" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-34.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days to the LORD.">Leviticus 23:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-13.htm" title="You shall observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that you have gathered in your corn and your wine:">Deuteronomy 16:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-16.htm" title="Three times in a year shall all your males appear before the LORD your God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the LORD empty:">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-10.htm" title="And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,">Deuteronomy 31:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-13.htm" title="Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.">2Chronicles 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-4.htm" title="They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;">Ezra 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/14-16.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.">Zechariah 14:16-19</a>, &c.). Like the feast of unleavened bread, this lasted for a week. It corresponded to a certain extent with modern "harvest-homes," but was more prolonged and of a more distinctly religious character. The time fixed for it was the week commencing with the fifteenth and terminating with the twenty-first of the month Tisri, corresponding to our October. The vintage and the olive-harvest had by that time been completed, and thanks were given for God's bounties through the whole year. At the same time the sojourn in the wilderness was commemorated; and as a memorial of that time those who attended the feast dwelt during its continuance in booths made of branches of trees. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-40.htm" title="And you shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.">Leviticus 23:40</a><span class= "ital">; </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/8-14.htm" title="And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month:">Nehemiah 8:14-17</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The feast of harvest</span>. Fifty days were to be numbered from the day of offering the barley sheaf, and on the <span class="accented">fiftieth</span> the feast of harvest, thence called "Pentecost," was to be celebrated. Different Jewish sects make different calculations; but the majority celebrate Pentecost on the sixth of Sivan (May 25). The main ceremony was the offering to God of two leavened loaves of the finest flour made out of the wheat just gathered in, and called the first-fruits of the harvest. The festival lasted only a single day; but it was one of a peculiarly social and joyful character (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-9.htm">Deuteronomy 16:9-11</a>). Jewish tradition connects the feast further with the giving of the law, which must certainly have taken place about the time (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-1.htm">Exodus 19:1-16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The firstfruits</span>. Rather, "Of the first-fruits." The word is in apposition with "harvest," not with "feast." <span class="cmt_word">Which thou hast sown</span>. The sown harvest was gathered in by Pentecost; what remained to collect afterwards was the produce of plantations. <span class="cmt_word">The feast of ingathering</span>. Called elsewhere, and more commonly, "the feast of tabernacles" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-13.htm">Deuteronomy 16:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-10.htm">Deuteronomy 31:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-2.htm">John 7:2</a>), from the circumstance that the people were commanded to make themselves booths, and dwell in them during the time of the feast. The festival began on the 15th of Tisri, or in the early part of our October, when the olives had been gathered in and the vintage was completed. It lasted seven, or (according to some) eight days, and comprised two holy convocations. In one point of view it was a festival of thanksgiving for the final getting in of the crops; in another, a commemoration of the safe passage through the desert from Egypt to Palestine. The feast seems to have been neglected during the captivity, but was celebrated with much glee in the time of Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-17.htm">Nehemiah 8:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the end of the year</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the end of the agricultural year - when the harvest was over - as explained in the following clause. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:10-19 Every seventh year the land was to rest. They must not plough or sow it; what the earth produced of itself, should be eaten, and not laid up. This law seems to have been intended to teach dependence on Providence, and God's faithfulness in sending the larger increase while they kept his appointments. It was also typical of the heavenly rest, when all earthly labours, cares, and interests shall cease for ever. All respect to the gods of the heathen is strictly forbidden. Since idolatry was a sin to which the Israelites leaned, they must blot out the remembrance of the gods of the heathen. Solemn religious attendance on God, in the place which he should choose, is strictly required. They must come together before the Lord. What a good Master do we serve, who has made it our duty to rejoice before him! Let us devote with pleasure to the service of God that portion of our time which he requires, and count his sabbaths and ordinances to be a feast unto our souls. They were not to come empty-handed; so now, we must not come to worship God empty-hearted; our souls must be filled with holy desires toward him, and dedications of ourselves to him; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</body></html>
