and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be to you forty and nine years.">Leviticus 25:8-13</a>). Nothing is added to the requirements of the fourth commandment; but the merciful intention of the Sabbath day is more fully brought out--it is to be kept <span class= "ital">in order that </span>the cattle may rest, and the slave and stranger may be refreshed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="accented">Law of the Sabbath, repeated</span>. Nothing is here added to the teaching of the Fourth Commandment; but its <span class="accented">merciful</span> character is especially brought out. Men are called on to observe it, <span class="accented">in order that</span> their cattle may obtain rest, and their servants, together with the stranger that is within their gates, may find refreshment. It is to be borne in mind that the foreign population of Palestine was mostly held to hard service. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-17.htm">2 Chronicles 2:17, 18</a>.) Verse 13 contains two injunctions - one general, one special: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> "Be circumspect" (or cautious, careful) "in respect of <span class="accented">all</span> that I command you." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> "Do not so much as utter the name of any false god." Not even to mention their names, was to show them the greatest contempt possible; and, if followed out universally, would soon have produced an absolute oblivion of them. Moses, it may be observed, scarcely ever does mention their names. Later historians and prophets had to do so, either to deliver the true history of the Israelites, or to denounce idolatries to which they were given. There are many words one would wish never to utter; but while wicked men do the things of which they are the names, preachers are obliged to use the words in their sermons and other warnings. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:10-19 Every seventh year the land was to rest. They must not plough or sow it; what the earth produced of itself, should be eaten, and not laid up. This law seems to have been intended to teach dependence on Providence, and God's faithfulness in sending the larger increase while they kept his appointments. It was also typical of the heavenly rest, when all earthly labours, cares, and interests shall cease for ever. All respect to the gods of the heathen is strictly forbidden. Since idolatry was a sin to which the Israelites leaned, they must blot out the remembrance of the gods of the heathen. Solemn religious attendance on God, in the place which he should choose, is strictly required. They must come together before the Lord. What a good Master do we serve, who has made it our duty to rejoice before him! Let us devote with pleasure to the service of God that portion of our time which he requires, and count his sabbaths and ordinances to be a feast unto our souls. They were not to come empty-handed; so now, we must not come to worship God empty-hearted; our souls must be filled with holy desires toward him, and dedications of ourselves to him; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</body></html>
