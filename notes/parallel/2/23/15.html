At such seasons we must not "appear before God empty," we must give Him not only "the salves of our lips," but some substantial acknowledgment of His goodness towards us. The law here laid down with respect to the first feast is afterwards extended to the other two (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-16.htm" title="Three times in a year shall all your males appear before the LORD your God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the LORD empty:">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The feast of unleavened bread</span>. This commenced with the Passover, and continued for the seven days following, with a "holy convocation" on the first of the seven and on the last (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-5.htm">Leviticus 23:5-8</a>). Unleavened bread was eaten in commemoration of the hasty exodus from Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-34.htm">Exodus 12:34</a>). A sheaf of new barley - the first-fruits of the harvest - was offered as a wave-offering before the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-10.htm">Leviticus 23:10-14</a>). Every male Israelite of full age was bound to attend, and to bring with him a free-will offering. <span class="cmt_word">In the time appointed of the month</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, on the fourteenth day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-18.htm">Exodus 12:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">None shall appear before me empty</span>. This rule applies, not to the Passover only, but to all the feasts. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:10-19 Every seventh year the land was to rest. They must not plough or sow it; what the earth produced of itself, should be eaten, and not laid up. This law seems to have been intended to teach dependence on Providence, and God's faithfulness in sending the larger increase while they kept his appointments. It was also typical of the heavenly rest, when all earthly labours, cares, and interests shall cease for ever. All respect to the gods of the heathen is strictly forbidden. Since idolatry was a sin to which the Israelites leaned, they must blot out the remembrance of the gods of the heathen. Solemn religious attendance on God, in the place which he should choose, is strictly required. They must come together before the Lord. What a good Master do we serve, who has made it our duty to rejoice before him! Let us devote with pleasure to the service of God that portion of our time which he requires, and count his sabbaths and ordinances to be a feast unto our souls. They were not to come empty-handed; so now, we must not come to worship God empty-hearted; our souls must be filled with holy desires toward him, and dedications of ourselves to him; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</body></html>
