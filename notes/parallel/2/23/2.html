but the words of the precept extend much further than this, and forbid our being carried away by numbers or popularity in any case. <span class= "ital">Vox populi vox Dei </span>is a favourite maxim with many, but Scripture nowhere sanctions it. Job boasts that he did not fear a great multitude (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-34.htm" title="Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?">Job 31:34</a>).

The prophets had always the multitude against them. "Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way," said our blessed Lord, "which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it." But 'wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat<span class= "ital">" </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/7-13.htm" title="Enter you in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leads to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:">Matthew 7:13-14</a>). We must be prepared to face unpopularity if we would walk in accordance with the Law of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil</span>. Rather, "Thou shalt not follow a multitude <span class="accented">to evil</span>." A law alike for deed, for word, and for thought. The example of the many is to be shunned. "Wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat." But "strait is the gate and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life; and few there be that find it" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13, 14</a>). It is extraordinary that so many, even of professing Christians, are content to go with the many, notwithstanding the warnings against so doing, both of the law and of the Gospel. <span class="cmt_word">Neither shalt thou speak,</span> etc. Rather, "Neither shalt thou bear witness in a cause to go aside after a multitude to put aside justice." The general precept is followed by a particular application of it. In judging a cause, if thou art one of the judges, thou shalt not simply go with the majority, if it he bent on injustice, but form thine own opinion and adhere to it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-9 In the law of Moses are very plain marks of sound moral feeling, and of true political wisdom. Every thing in it is suited to the desired and avowed object, the worship of one only God, and the separation of Israel from the pagan world. Neither parties, friends, witnesses, nor common opinions, must move us to lessen great faults, to aggravate small ones, excuse offenders, accuse the innocent, or misrepresent any thing.</body></html>
