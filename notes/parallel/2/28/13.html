THE BREASTPLATE.</span><p>(13-30) The space devoted to the "breastplate" is indicative of its high importance. It was the most costly, most magnificent, and most conspicuous of the high priest's garments, while at the same time it was the most mysterious. Externally it was a blaze of gold <span class= "bld">and </span>jewels; internally it held those strange and precious objects known as "the Urim and the Thummim" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-30.htm" title="And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be on Aaron's heart, when he goes in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel on his heart before the LORD continually.">Exodus 28:30</a>), by means of which the Divine will was made known to the high priest, and through him to the people. The basis of the garment was a linen fabric of similar materials and workmanship with the ephod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-15.htm" title="And you shall make the breastplate of judgment with cunning work; after the work of the ephod you shall make it; of gold, of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine twined linen, shall you make it.">Exodus 28:15</a>), square in shape, about nine inches each way, and "doubled," so as to form internally a bag or pocket. Upon this linen groundwork were fastened twelve "stones," or jewels, set in an open-work of gold, and arranged in four rows, three in each (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/28-17.htm" title="And you shall set in it settings of stones, even four rows of stones: the first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this shall be the first row.">Exodus 28:17-21</a>). These stones covered probably the greater portion of the external surface of the breastplate. To its two upper corners were attached two rings of gold, which were made fast by means of gold chains to buttons (" ouches") on the upper part of the ephod; and to its two lower corners were attached similar rings, which were fastened by a lace to rings of the same material on the lower part of the ephod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/28-13.htm" title="And you shall make ouches of gold;">Exodus 28:13-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/28-22.htm" title="And you shall make on the breastplate chains at the ends of wreathen work of pure gold.">Exodus 28:22-28</a>).<p>(13) <span class= "bld">Ouches of gold.</span>--"Buttons" or "rosettes" of similar open-work to that which formed the setting of the onyx stones upon the shoulders of the ephod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-11.htm" title="With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a signet, shall you engrave the two stones with the names of the children of Israel: you shall make them to be set in ouches of gold.">Exodus 28:11</a>). These "buttons" must have been sewn on to the ephod.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-30.</span> - THE BREAST-PLATE. It has been noticed that the ephod had for its main object or purpose to be a receptacle for the breast-plate which was attached to it after it had been put on, and formed its principal ornament. The Hebrew word <span class="accented">khoshen</span>, which is translated "breast-plate," means "ornament;" and the khoshen must certainly have been the most striking and brilliant object in the whole attire of the high priest. Externally, it did but repeat the symbolism of the ephod, exhibiting the high priest as the representative of the twelve tribes, whose names were engraved upon its twelve stones, as well as upon the onyxes of the ephod. Internally, it had, however, another, and a deeper import. It contained within it the Urim and the Thummim (ver. 30), by means of which God was consulted, and signified his will to his people. This must be regarded as its main end and use. It was from the <span class="accented">decisions</span> thus given that it received the name of "the breastplate (or ornament) of judgment." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ouches of gold</span>. "Buttons" according to one view (Cook): "sockets," according to another (Kalisch): "rosettes," according to a third (Keil). Some small ornament of open-work (see the comment on ver. 11), which could be sewn on to the ephod, and whereto a chain might be attached, seems to be intended. The object was to fasten the "breast-plate" firmly to the ephod. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:6-14 This richly-wrought ephod was the outmost garment of the high priest; plain linen ephods were worn by the inferior priests. It was a short coat without sleeves, fastened close to the body with a girdle. The shoulder-pieces were buttoned together with precious stones set in gold, one on each shoulder, on which were engraven the names of the children of Israel. Thus Christ, our High Priest, presents his people before the Lord for a memorial. As Christ's coat had no seam, but was woven from the top throughout, so it was with the ephod. The golden bells on this ephod, by their preciousness and pleasant sound, well represent the good profession that the saints make, and the pomegranates the fruit they bring forth.</body></html>
