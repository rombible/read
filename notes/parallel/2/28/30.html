The expression used is identical with that employed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-15.htm" title="The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it.">Exodus 25:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-21.htm" title="And you shall put the mercy seat above on the ark; and in the ark you shall put the testimony that I shall give you.">Exodus 25:21</a> with respect to putting the Two Tables into the Ark of the Covenant, and can scarcely have any other meaning than the literal placing of one thing inside another. It has been already shown (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-16.htm" title="Foursquare it shall be being doubled; a span shall be the length thereof, and a span shall be the breadth thereof.">Exodus 28:16</a>) that the breastplate was a bag, and so capable of being used as a receptacle. The words "Urim and Thummim" mean literally, "lights and perfections," or, if the plural be one of dignity, "light and perfection" (Aquila and Symmachus translate by <span class= "greekheb">???????? ??? ???????????</span>; the LXX., by <span class= "greekheb">? ??????? ??? ? ???????</span>; the Vulg. by doctrina et veritas). The question arises, what do these two words, as here used, designate? Do they designate material objects; if so, what objects? In favour of their designating material objects are (1) the expressions, "thou shalt put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim," "they shall be upon Aaron's heart," "he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-8.htm" title="And he put the breastplate on him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.">Leviticus 8:8</a>); (2) the fact that the words are accompanied by the article, on this, the first mention of them, as if they were familiar objects, well known at the time to the people generally; and (3) the explanations of Philo and Josephus, which, while they differ in all other respects, agree in this, that material objects are intended. But, if so, what objects? The two sides of the breastplate, says Philo (<span class= "ital">De Monarch., </span>ii. 5). But these were not "put in" the breastplate after it was complete, as implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-30.htm" title="And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be on Aaron's heart, when he goes in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel on his heart before the LORD continually.">Exodus 28:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-8.htm" title="And he put the breastplate on him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.">Leviticus 8:8</a>. The twelve jewels, says Josephus; but the present passage, taken in conjunction with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/28-17.htm" title="And you shall set in it settings of stones, even four rows of stones: the first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this shall be the first row.">Exodus 28:17-21</a>, distinguishes the Urim and Thummim from them. Some small objects which the bag of the breastplate could hold, and with which the people had long been familiar, can alone answer the requirements of the case. Most modern critics are thus far agreed; but when the further question is asked, what were these objects? The greatest difference appears. Diamonds, cut and uncut; slips of metal, marked with "yes" and "no"; lots, of some kind or other; and small images, like the <span class= "ital">teraphim </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-19.htm" title="And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.">Genesis 31:19</a>), are among the suggestions. A very slight examination of the arguments by which these various views are supported is sufficient to show that certainty on the subject is unattainable. Probability, however, seems on the whole to be in favour of a connection between divination by <span class= "ital">teraphim </span>and consultation of God by Urim and Thummim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-5.htm" title="And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.">Judges 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-14.htm" title="Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said to their brothers, Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what you have to do.">Judges 18:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-17.htm" title="And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.">Judges 18:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-20.htm" title="And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the middle of the people.">Judges 18:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-4.htm" title="For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:">Hosea 3:4</a>), whence it is reasonable to conclude that the Urim and Thummim were small images, by which God had been consulted in the past, and by which Moses was now authorised to state that He would be consulted in the future. How the consultation was made, and the decision given, is a question still more obscure than that which has been just considered, and one which seems to the present writer to admit of no solution. The reader who is curious upon the point may be referred to Dean Plumptre's article on "Urim and Thummim," in Dr. W. Smith's <span class= "ital">Dictionary of the Bible, </span>where the views propounded are ingenious, if not altogether satisfactory.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Thou shalt put in the breast-plate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim.</span> The words <span class="accented">Urim</span> and <span class="accented">Thummim</span> mean respectively "Lights "and" Perfections," or perhaps "Light" and "Perfection - the plural form being merely a plural of honour. They were well translated by Aquila and Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>: less well by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>: still worse by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Doctrina et Veritas</span>. What exactly the two words represented is doubtful in the extreme. It has been supposed by some that they were not material objects, but a method by which God communicated his will; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, a miraculous light, or a miraculous voice. But such things as these could not have been put by Moses either "in," or "on the breastplate of judgment." Modern critics are generally agreed that the Urim and Thummim must have been material objects of one kind or another. The objects suggested are - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The engraved stones of the breast-plate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Two small images, like the <span class="accented">teraphim</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> A gold plate, engraved with the name of Jehovah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> Three plates or slips; one blank, one engraved with "yes," and one with "no." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> Diamonds, cut and uncut, with marks engraved on them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Against the first of these views it is urged with very great force that the present passage shows the Urim and Thummim to be something quite distinct from the breast-plate - something which was to be added to the breast-plate after all the stones had been set in it; and which Aaron was to bear upon his breast in addition to the breast-plate and its jewels (compare ver. 29 with ver. 30). Against the fourth and fifth, it is sufficient to observe that they are pure conjectures, without any basis of authority, either in Scripture or tradition. The second and the third remain. The third has important Jewish names in its favour, but is open to the objection that it makes a single object correspond to both words. The second alone seems to have any basis in Scripture, which certainly connects the use of <span class="accented">teraphim</span> with the use of an ephod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-5.htm">Judges 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-14.htm">Judges 18:14, 17, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a>). On the whole, while admitting that there is no sufficient evidence to determine the question, we incline to regard the Urim and Thummim as small images, kept in the bag of the "breast-plate" (ver. 16), by means of which the high priest gave a decision when he was consulted. How the decision was arrived at, is an even more difficult problem than the one which we have attempted to solve. Some suppose the two images to have been used as lots, one giving an affirmative and the other a negative answer. Others imagine, that by gazing attentively upon them, and fixing his thoughts on the qualities which they symbolised - illumination and perfection - the high priest was thrown into an ecstatic state which enabled him to prophesy aright. The notion has even been started, that an angel spoke by their lips, and answered any question that was put to them. The truth seems to be that no theory on the subject can be more than a theory - quite arbitrary and conjectural - neither Scripture nor tradition furnishing any hint on the matter. If we knew how men divined from teraphim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-24.htm">2 Kings 23:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-21.htm">Ezekiel 21:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-2.htm">Zechariah 10:2</a>), we might thence obtain some inkling of the truth, since there is much probability in the view, that the teraphim were employed as an unauthorised substitute for the Urim and Thummim. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-5.htm">Judges 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-5.htm">Judges 18:5, 6, 14-20</a>.) But the method of this divination is wholly unknown. It is not however likely to have been a mere casting of lots, which is a very simple process, and requires no images; nor can this explanation of the decision by Urim and Thummim be regarded as having probability m its favour. Perhaps, of all the theories, that which supposes the Urim and Thummim to have been objects gazed at by the high priest until he entered the ecstatic state, is the least objectionable. It must not, however, be considered an essential part of this theory, that the material objects were derived from the religion of Egypt (Plumptre). The objects must have been well known to Moses and to those for whom he wrote; otherwise, they could not have been introduced, without any account of their nature, as," The Urim" and "The Thummim." They had probably been long possessed and consulted by the nation, which was accustomed to believe that it received enlightenment from them. Perhaps they were a sort of teraphim, but unconnected with any idolatrous worship. It is quite conceivable that an old usage, hitherto un-authorised, but not debased by any flagrant corruption, should have been adopted by Divine command into the Mosaic ritual, purified of any evil that attached to it, and consecrated to an important purpose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 28:31-35 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:15-30 The chief ornament of the high priest, was the breastplate, a rich piece of cloth, curiously worked. The name of each tribe was graven in a precious stone, fixed in the breastplate, to signify how precious, in God's sight, believers are, and how honourable. How small and poor soever the tribe was, it was as a precious stone in the breastplate of the high priest; thus are all the saints dear to Christ, however men esteem them. The high priest had the names of the tribes, both on his shoulders and on his breast, which reminds us of the power and the love with which our Lord Jesus pleads for those that are his. He not only bears them up in his arms with almighty strength, but he carries them in his bosom with tender affection. What comfort is this to us in all our addresses to God! The Urim and Thummim, by which the will of God was made known in doubtful cases, were put in this breastplate. Urim and Thummim signify light and integrity. There are many conjectures what these were; the most probable opinion seems to be, that they were the twelve precious stones in the high priest's breastplate. Now, Christ is our Oracle. By him God, in these last days, makes known himself and his mind to us, Heb 1:1,2; Joh 1:18. He is the true Light, the faithful Witness, the Truth itself, and from him we receive the Spirit of Truth, who leads into all truth.</body></html>
