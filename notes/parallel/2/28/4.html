The most conspicuous was the breastplate, described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/28-13.htm" title="And you shall make ouches of gold;">Exodus 28:13-30</a>, and here mentioned first of all. Next to this came the peculiar vestment called the "ephod," a sort of jerkin or waistcoat, upon which the breastplate was worn (described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/28-6.htm" title="And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple, of scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work.">Exodus 28:6-12</a>). Under the ephod was the long robe of blue, called "the robe of the ephod," which may be considered as the main garment, and which is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/28-31.htm" title="And you shall make the robe of the ephod all of blue.">Exodus 28:31-35</a>. Upon his head the high priest wore a "mitre" or turban (described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/28-36.htm" title="And you shall make a plate of pure gold, and grave on it, like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.">Exodus 28:36-38</a>); and inside his "robe" he wore a linen shirt or tunic, secured by a girdle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-39.htm" title="And you shall embroider the coat of fine linen, and you shall make the turban of fine linen, and you shall make the girdle of needlework.">Exodus 28:39</a>). Underneath the tunic he wore linen drawers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/28-42.htm" title="And you shall make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness; from the loins even to the thighs they shall reach:">Exodus 28:42-43</a>).

The enumeration does not follow the same order exactly as the description. The two agree, however, in giving the precedence to the same three articles of apparel out of the six - viz., the breast-plate, the ephod, and the robe. <span class="cmt_word">His sons</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, his successors in the office of high priest, <span class="accented">The materials of the priestly garments.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-5 Hitherto the heads of families were the priests, and offered sacrifices; but now this office was confined to the family of Aaron only; and so continued till the gospel dispensation. The holy garments not only distinguished the priests from the people, but were emblems of that holy conduct which should ever be the glory and beauty, the mark of the ministers of religion, without which their persons and ministrations will be had in contempt. They also typified the glory of the Divine majesty, and the beauty of complete holiness, which rendered Jesus Christ the great High Priest. But our adorning under the gospel, is not to be of gold and costly array, but the garments of salvation, the robe of righteousness.</body></html>
