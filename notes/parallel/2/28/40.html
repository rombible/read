The word used, <span class= "ital">migba'ah, </span>is derived from <span class= "ital">gabia</span>', "a cup" or "basin."<p><span class= "bld">For glory and for beauty.</span>--It is certainly remarkable that so plain a dress as that of the ordinary priests--a white tunic, a girdle, which may or may not have been embroidered, and a plain white close-fitting cap--should be regarded as sufficing "for glory and for beauty." White robes, however, are in Scripture constantly represented as eminently glorious (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-9.htm" title="I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.">Daniel 7:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-3.htm" title="And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.">Mark 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-12.htm" title="And sees two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.">John 20:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-10.htm" title="And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;">Acts 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm" title="And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and on the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.">Revelation 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-11.htm" title="And white robes were given to every one of them; and it was said to them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brothers, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.">Revelation 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/7-9.htm" title="After this I beheld, and, see, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;">Revelation 7:9-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-6.htm" title="And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles.">Revelation 15:6</a>, &c.).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 40-43.</span> - THE APPAREL OF THE ORDINARY PRIESTS. The chapter concludes with brief directions concerning the official attire of the ordinary priests. This was to consist of linen drawers like those of the high priest; of a tunic, also of linen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-27.htm">Exodus 39:27</a>), shaped like his, but not diapered; of a linen girdle, the exact character of which is not stated; and of a close-fitting cap. The entire dress, with perhaps the exception of the girdle, was white. The linen drawers were regarded as of primary necessity, and the priest who did not wear them was threatened with death. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For Aaron's sons</span>. His actual sons at this time - his descendants afterwards, to whom the priesthood was rigidly confined. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt make coats</span>. The verb is different from that used in ver 39, and seems to imply that the priests' tunics were not to be patterned. <span class="cmt_word">Girdles</span>. It has generally been supposed that these were of the same material and workmanship as the high priest's; but this is nowhere stated. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-29.htm">Exodus 39:29</a>, the high priest's girdle alone is spoken cf. <span class="cmt_word">Bonnets</span>. Certainly not "bonnets "in the modern sense. Plain, close-fitting caps, shaped like a cup, or rather basin, seem to be meant. Such caps were often worn in Egypt, but not by the priests. <span class="cmt_word">For glory and for beauty</span>. See above, ver. 2. It is very noticeable, that the extremely simple attire of the ordinary priests - a dress of pure white, without anything ornamental about it, unless it were the girdle - is still regarded as sufficient "for glory and for beauty." White robes have certainly a vast amount of scriptural testimony in their favour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-3.htm">Mark 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-12.htm">John 20:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-10.htm">Acts 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-11.htm">Revelation 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9, 14</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:40-43 The priest's garments typify the righteousness of Christ. If we appear not before God in that, we shall bear our iniquity, and die. Blessed is he, therefore, that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, Re 16:15. And blessed be God that we have a High Priest, appointed of God, and set apart for his work; furnished for his high office by the glory of his Divine majesty, and the beauty of perfect holiness. Happy are we, if by the law spiritually understood, we see that such a High Priest became us; that we cannot draw near to a holy God, or be accepted, but by him. There is no light, no wisdom, no perfection, but from him; no glory, no beauty, but in being like unto him. Let us take encouragement from the power, love, and compassion of our High Priest, to draw near with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</body></html>
