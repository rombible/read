THE MITRE.</span><p>(36-39) The head-dress of the high priest was to be of fine white linen (<span class= "ital">shesh</span>) and appears by the description of Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant. Jud. </span>iii. 7, ? 3) to have been a turban, made of several thick swathes or folds in the usual way. It was to be adorned in front with a plate of pure gold bearing the inscription "Holiness to Jehovah," which was to be attached to the linen fabric by a ribbon or "lace" of blue.<p>(36) <span class= "bld">Thou shalt make a plate.</span>--The plate is so much of the essence of the mitre that it is put forward first, as that whereto all the rest is subordinate. It was to be "of pure gold," and "fastened on high upon the mitre" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-31.htm" title="And they tied to it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high on the turban; as the LORD commanded Moses.">Exodus 39:31</a>); so catching the eye even more than the breastplate, and drawing men's special attention. But the plate itself was only the vehicle for an inscription, and thus men's attention would be especially directed to that. It taught the great truth that religion culminates in "Holiness to Jehovah," without which all else is worthless--forms, ceremonies, priestly attire, sacrifice, prayer, are mockeries. It required primarily the high priest himself to be holy; but it was a call also to the whole nation, whose representative the high priest was, that they should be "a holy nation," "a kingdom of priests" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm" title="And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.">Exodus 19:6</a>), and should consecrate themselves heart and soul to Jehovah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 36-38.</span> - THE MITRE. Josephus tells us that the head-dress of the high priest was "not a conical cap, but a sort of crown, made of thick linen swathes" (<span class="accented">Ant. Jud.</span> 3:7, &sect; 3). It was thus really a species of turban. The colour was white; and the only ornament on it was the gold plate, with its blue ribbon or fillet. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt make a plate of pure gold</span>. The plate, though a mere ornament of the mitre, was, at once, its most conspicuous and its most significant feature. Placed directly in front, right over the forehead, and probably of burnished gold, it would attract universal attention, and catch the eye even more than the breast-plate. Its position made it "the culminating point of the whole priestly attire" (Kalisch) - and its inscription gave to that position extraordinary force and significance. For it taught that "<span class="cmt_word">holiness</span> <span class="cmt_word">to the Lord"</span> is the very highest crown and truest excellence of religion - that to which all ceremonial is meant to conduce - that without which all the paraphernalia of worship must ever be in God's sight a mockery. It set this truth conspicuously before the eyes, and was apt to impress it upon the hearts of all. It taught the high priest himself not to rest upon outward forms, but to aim in his own person, and teach the people to aim continually, at internal holiness. The extreme importance of this, causes the putting forward at once of the plate and its inscription before any account of the "mitre" is given. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:31-39 The robe of the ephod was under the ephod, and reached down to the knees, without sleeves. Aaron must minister in the garments appointed. We must serve the Lord with holy fear, as those who know they deserve to die. A golden plate was fixed on Aaron's forehead, engraven with Holiness to the Lord. Aaron was hereby reminded that God is holy, and that his priests must be holy, devoted to the Lord. This must appear in their forehead, in open profession of their relation to God. It must be engraven like the engravings of a signet; deep and durable; not painted so as to be washed off, but firm and lasting; such must our holiness to the Lord be. Christ is our High Priest; through him sins are forgiven to us, and not laid to our charge. Our persons, our doings, are pleasing to God upon the account of Christ, and not otherwise.</body></html>
