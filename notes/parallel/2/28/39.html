THE INNER TUNIC OR "COAT."</span><p>(39) The garments hitherto described have been the outer garments. To these are now added the inner ones, of which there was but little to be said. They consisted of linen drawers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/28-42.htm" title="And you shall make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness; from the loins even to the thighs they shall reach:">Exodus 28:42-43</a>), a linen tunic or shirt, woven in a peculiar way, and, to confine the tunic, a girdle, which was to be of many colours (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-29.htm" title="And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.">Exodus 39:29</a>), and ornamented with embroidery.<p><span class= "bld">Thou shalt embroider.</span>--It is generally agreed that this is a wrong rendering. Kalisch translates, "thou shalt weave." Gesenius, "thou shalt work in chequer." Canon Cook, "thou shalt weave in diaper work." The word used, which is a rare one, probably designates some peculiar kind of weaving.<p><span class= "bld">The coat.</span>--"Coat" is an unfortunate translation. The <span class= "ital">ketoneth </span>(comp. Gr. <span class= "greekheb">?????</span>) was a long white linen tunic or shirt, having tight-fitting sleeves, and reaching nearly to the feet. The sleeves must certainly have shown, as they were the only covering of the priest's arms; and the lower part of the tunic probably showed below the "robe of the ephod."<p><span class= "bld">6. THE INNER GIRDLE.</span><p>It appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-29.htm" title="And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.">Exodus 39:29</a> that the girdle was to be "of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet," like the ephod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-6.htm" title="And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple, of scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work.">Exodus 28:6</a>). It was not, however, to be woven of these colours, but to have them worked into it with the needle. As it was worn immediately above the tunic and underneath the robe of the ephod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-7.htm" title="And he put on him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod on him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it to him therewith.">Leviticus 8:7</a>), little, if any, of it could have been seen. Perhaps, however, the ends may have depended below the robe of the ephod.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - THE TUNIC AND GIRDLE. From the outer garments, which were the most important and distinctive, a transition is now made to the inner ones, in which there was nothing very remarkable. The linen drawers are for the present omitted, as not peculiar to the high priest. Directions are given for the tunic and the girdle. The former is to be woven in some peculiar way - so as to be diapered, as some think - and the latter is to be "the work of the embroiderer." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt embroider</span>. This is certainly not the meaning of the Hebrew. Some peculiar mode of weaving the coat is intended. <span class="cmt_word">The coat</span>. Rather, "the tunic" or "shirt." The <span class="accented">keloneth</span> was a long linen gown or cassock, worn immediately over the drawers. It reached to the feet, and had tightly-fitting sleeves (Joseph. <span class="accented">Ant. Jud.</span> 3:7, &sect; 2). Whether it showed beneath the "robe of the ephod," or not, is uncertain; but the sleeves must certainly have been visible. The <span class="accented">keloneth</span> was white. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt make the mitre of fine linen</span>. This direction had not been previously given. It is a little out of place. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt make the girdle of</span> <span class="cmt_word">needlework.</span> Literally, "of the work of the embroiderer." The girdle was worn directly over the linen shirt, and under "the robe of the ephod." It would seem that it was not seen at all, unless its ends hung down below "the robe of the ephod." It was however to be artistically embroidered (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-29.htm">Exodus 39:29</a>.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 28:40-43 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:31-39 The robe of the ephod was under the ephod, and reached down to the knees, without sleeves. Aaron must minister in the garments appointed. We must serve the Lord with holy fear, as those who know they deserve to die. A golden plate was fixed on Aaron's forehead, engraven with Holiness to the Lord. Aaron was hereby reminded that God is holy, and that his priests must be holy, devoted to the Lord. This must appear in their forehead, in open profession of their relation to God. It must be engraven like the engravings of a signet; deep and durable; not painted so as to be washed off, but firm and lasting; such must our holiness to the Lord be. Christ is our High Priest; through him sins are forgiven to us, and not laid to our charge. Our persons, our doings, are pleasing to God upon the account of Christ, and not otherwise.</body></html>
