THE EPHOD.</span><p>(6-12) The ephod was, as already observed (Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-4.htm" title="And these are the garments which they shall make; a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a turban, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother, and his sons, that he may minister to me in the priest's office.">Exodus 28:4</a>), a sort of jerkin or waistcoat. It was made in two pieces, a front piece and a back piece, which were joined together at the shoulders, apparently by a seam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-7.htm" title="It shall have the two shoulder pieces thereof joined at the two edges thereof; and so it shall be joined together.">Exodus 28:7</a>). The pieces descended to the waist; and there one or other of them was expanded into a band, called "the curious girdle of the ephod," which being passed round the waist and fastened, kept both front and back pieces in place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-8.htm" title="And the curious girdle of the ephod, which is on it, shall be of the same, according to the work thereof; even of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.">Exodus 28:8</a>). On either shoulder was an onyx stone set in gold (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/28-9.htm" title="And you shall take two onyx stones, and grave on them the names of the children of Israel:">Exodus 28:9-11</a>), and engraved with the names of six of the tribes.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">With cunning work.</span>--On this phrase, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-1.htm" title="Moreover you shall make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubim of cunning work shall you make them.">Exodus 26:1</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall make</span> <span class="cmt_word">the ephod</span> The word <span class="accented">ephod</span> signifies etymologically any "vestment" or "garment;" but in its use it is confined to the special vestment here described, the great object of which was to be a receptacle for the "breast-plate." The ephod was a sort of jerkin or waistcoat, consisting of two pieces, one to cover the chest and the other the back, joined together probably by a seam, above the shoulders, and united at the waist by a band called "the curious girdle of the ephod." This band was of one piece with the ephod, being woven on either to the front or the back part; it held the other part in place, and was passed round the body and fastened either with a clasp, or with buttons, or strings. <span class="cmt_word">Of gold, of blue, of purple</span>, etc. - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "of the same materials as the curtains and veil of the sanctuary, with the addition of gold." The gold was probably in the shape of gold thread, or wire of extreme tenuity, and was introduced by the needle after the fabric bad been woven, as was commonly done in Egypt (Herod. 3:47; Wilkinson's <span class="accented">Ancient Egyptians</span>, vol. 3. p. 128: compare below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-3.htm">Exodus 39:3</a>). The white, blue, purple, and scarlet threads were doubtless woven into a pattern of some kind; but it is impossible to say what the pattern was. In Egypt patterns were not much affected, the dress worn being commonly white, with a stripe sometimes at the edge; but the Semitic tribes, who bordered Egypt on the East, affected gay colours and. varied designs, if we may trust the Egyptian wall-paintings. <span class="cmt_word">With cunning work</span>. Literally, "work of the skilled (workman)." Some of the Hebrews had evidently carried on the trade of weaving in Egypt, and had brought their looms with them. The Egyptian looms were hand-looms, and of no great size; they admitted of easy transport. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:6-14 This richly-wrought ephod was the outmost garment of the high priest; plain linen ephods were worn by the inferior priests. It was a short coat without sleeves, fastened close to the body with a girdle. The shoulder-pieces were buttoned together with precious stones set in gold, one on each shoulder, on which were engraven the names of the children of Israel. Thus Christ, our High Priest, presents his people before the Lord for a memorial. As Christ's coat had no seam, but was woven from the top throughout, so it was with the ephod. The golden bells on this ephod, by their preciousness and pleasant sound, well represent the good profession that the saints make, and the pomegranates the fruit they bring forth.</body></html>
