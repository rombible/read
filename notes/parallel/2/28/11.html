Rather, "an artificer." <span class="cmt_word">The engravings of a signet</span>. Signets in Egypt were ordinarily rings, on the bezel of which the name of the owner was inscribed. Some were of solid gold; others with cylindrical bezels of glass or hard stone. On the early use of such signet rings in Egypt see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>. Cylinders, strung round the wrist and engraved with a name and titles, were common in Mesopotamia from <span class="date">B.C. 2000</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Ouches of gold.</span> Settings in open-work or filagree seem to be intended - a kind of setting which is very common in Egyptian ornaments. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:6-14 This richly-wrought ephod was the outmost garment of the high priest; plain linen ephods were worn by the inferior priests. It was a short coat without sleeves, fastened close to the body with a girdle. The shoulder-pieces were buttoned together with precious stones set in gold, one on each shoulder, on which were engraven the names of the children of Israel. Thus Christ, our High Priest, presents his people before the Lord for a memorial. As Christ's coat had no seam, but was woven from the top throughout, so it was with the ephod. The golden bells on this ephod, by their preciousness and pleasant sound, well represent the good profession that the saints make, and the pomegranates the fruit they bring forth.</body></html>
