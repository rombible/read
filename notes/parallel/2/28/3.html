Moderns suppose such things to be quite beneath the notice of the Creator of the universe. But it has to be remembered, on the other hand, (1) that God is the fountain whence all knowledge is derived; (2) that He alone knows what is beneath Him and what is not beneath Him; and (3) that dress is not a wholly insignificant matter, or so much would not have been said in Scripture about it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-21.htm" title="To Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.">Genesis 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-3.htm" title="Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors.">Genesis 37:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-42.htm" title="And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in clothing of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/8-7.htm" title="And he put on him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod on him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it to him therewith.">Leviticus 8:7-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-4.htm" title="He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches on his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen turban shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.">Leviticus 16:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-38.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put on the fringe of the borders a ribbon of blue:">Numbers 15:38</a>, &c.). Garments intended "for glory and for beauty" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-2.htm" title="And you shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother for glory and for beauty.">Exodus 28:2</a>) required artistic power in those who were to make them; and artistic power, like all other intellectual excellence, is the gift of God.<p><span class= "bld">To consecrate him.</span>--Investiture in the holy garments was a part of the ceremony of consecration. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/8-7.htm" title="And he put on him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod on him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it to him therewith.">Leviticus 8:7-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-13.htm" title="And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats on them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets on them; as the LORD commanded Moses.">Leviticus 8:13</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wise-hearted</span>. In modern parlance the heart is made the seat of the affections and emotions, the brain of the intellect. But the Hebrew idiom was different. There the heart was constantly spoken of as the seat of wisdom. (See below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-6.htm">Exodus 31:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-10.htm">Exodus 35:10, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/36-1.htm">Exodus 36:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-4.htm">Job 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-29.htm">Proverbs 11:29</a>, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">The spirit of wisdom</span> might seem to be scarcely necessary for the work of constructing a set of priestly garments; but where "glory and beauty" are required, high artistic power is needed; and this power is regarded by the sacred writers, as indeed it is by most of those who have written on the human understanding - notably Plato and Aristotle - as a very important part of the intellect. <span class="accented">Techne</span>, says Aristotle, involves <span class="accented">theoria</span>, as well as <span class="accented">aesthesis</span> and <span class="accented">genesis</span>, requires, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, a knowledge of high abstract truths, as well as the perceptive faculty which we commonly call "taste," and the constructive one known as "power of execution." (See <span class="accented">Eth. Nic</span>. 6:4, &sect; 4.) It is, with him, one of the five chief intellectual excellences. <span class="cmt_word">To consecrate him</span>. Investiture in the holy garments was made a part of the ceremony of consecration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-5.htm">Exodus 29:5-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-7.htm">Leviticus 8:7-9, 13</a>), as it is in the English Ordinal in the consecration of a bishop. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-5 Hitherto the heads of families were the priests, and offered sacrifices; but now this office was confined to the family of Aaron only; and so continued till the gospel dispensation. The holy garments not only distinguished the priests from the people, but were emblems of that holy conduct which should ever be the glory and beauty, the mark of the ministers of religion, without which their persons and ministrations will be had in contempt. They also typified the glory of the Divine majesty, and the beauty of complete holiness, which rendered Jesus Christ the great High Priest. But our adorning under the gospel, is not to be of gold and costly array, but the garments of salvation, the robe of righteousness.</body></html>
