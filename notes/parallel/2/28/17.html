In the present case, scarcely one of the twelve stones can be said to be determined with certainty. 1. The <span class= "ital">odem, </span>identified by the LXX. and the Vulg. With the "sard," has been regarded as the ruby, the carbuncle, and the carnelian. Etymologically the word means "red," or "the red stone." The ruby is certainly wrong, since ancient engravers could not cut it. Either "sard" or "carnelian" is probably intended, both being common in Egypt. 2. The <span class= "ital">pitdah </span>is certainly not the topaz, which could no more be cut than the ruby. If the word is derived, as supposed, from a root meaning "pale," the chrysolite, which resembles a pale topaz, but is far softer, may be meant. 3. The <span class= "ital">bar?keth </span>is rendered <span class= "ital">smaragdus, </span>"emerald," by the LXX. and Vulg.; but neither could the emerald be cut by the ancient engravers. The word means "brightly flashing," which tells us next to nothing. "Beryl" and "a kind of corundum" have been suggested; but neither is particularly sparkling. 4. The <span class= "ital">nophek, </span>translated <span class= "greekheb">??????</span> by the LXX. and Josehus, may well be the "carbuncle," as is now generally supposed. It cannot, any more than the <span class= "ital">odem, </span>be the ruby. 5. The <span class= "ital">sappir </span>one might have supposed by its name to be certainly the "sapphire;" but this, again, is a gem which ancient engravers could not cut. It would seem that here we have one of the cases where the name has been transferred from one stone to another, the modern "lapis lazuli" being the gem which was called "sapphire" by the ancients. 6. The <span class= "ital">yah?lom </span>is certainly not the "diamond," which is the hardest of all gems. The LXX. and Vulg. translate by "jasper" (<span class= "greekheb">??????</span><span class= "ital">, jaspis</span>); but this seems really to have been the twelfth stone. Other renderings are mere conjectures, and the <span class= "ital">yah?lom </span>must be regarded as unknown. 7. The <span class= "ital">leshem, </span>rendered "ligure" by the LXX., the Vulgate, Josephus, and our translators, is probably the stone known to the ancients as <span class= "ital">lapis ligurius, </span>but what that stone was is a matter of great uncertainty. It has been regarded as amber, as jacinth, and as tourmaline; but amber does not admit of engraving, while jacinth and tourmaline are pure conjectures. This stone, then, must also be regarded as unknown. 8. The <span class= "ital">shevo, </span>rendered <span class= "ital">achates, </span>"agate," by the LXX. and the Vulg., is generally allowed to have been that stone, which was well known to the ancients, and widely used for engraving. 9. The <span class= "ital">akhlamah </span>was regarded as the amethyst by the LXX., the Vulgate, and Josephus; but it has been suggested that it may have been "malachite" (Knobel); and there is no disproving the suggestion. Still the amethyst, which is easily engraved, and was well known in Egypt, should find a place in the present list, and may well have been intended by the <span class= "ital">akhlamah. </span>10. The <span class= "ital">tarshish, </span>by its name, should be a stone brought from Tarshish, which is either Tarsus or Tartessus. Some suppose it to have been the beryl, some the chrysolite, others the turquoise. There are really no sufficient grounds for identifying it with any known gem. 11. The <span class= "ital">shoham </span>has been already discussed (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-9.htm" title="And you shall take two onyx stones, and grave on them the names of the children of Israel:">Exodus 28:9</a>), and identified with the onyx, or the sardonyx. 12. The <span class= "ital">yash'peh </span>should, by its name, be the "jasper," which was one of the stones most used in Egypt, and which could scarcely have been absent from the present list. The LXX., however, translate "onyx," Josephus and the Vulgate "beryl;" so that here again there is uncertainty. The views of the present writer may be best presented to the reader by means of a table:--<p>1st Row of Gems . . .<p>2nd Row . . .<p>3rd Row . . .<p>4th Row . . .<p>Odern<p>(the Sard)<p>Nophck<p>(the Carbuncle)<p>Leshem<p>(uncertain)<p>Tarshish<p>(uncertain)<p>Pitdah<p>(the Chrysolite)<p>Sappir<p>(the Lapis Lazuli)<p>Shevo<p>(the Agate)<p>Shoham<p>(the Onyx or the<p>Sardonyx)<p>Bar?tketh<p>(uncertain)<p>Yuhalom<p>(uncertain)<p>Akhlamah<p>(the Amethyst)<p>Yush'peh<p>(the Jasper)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Settings of stones</span>. These were similar to those of the two shoulder stones - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of filagree or <span class="accented">cloisonne</span> work - as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-13.htm">Exodus 39:13</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The first row</span> of the stones is said to have been composed of a <span class="cmt_word">sardius</span>, or sard, <span class="cmt_word">a topaz, and a carbuncle</span>. Of these names the first only would seem to be tolerably certain. The second cannot be right, since the topaz was too hard a stone to be engraved by the ancient engravers. We may conjecture that the chrysolite, a pale stone not unlike the topaz, but far less hard, was the Genesis intended. The "carbuncle" is also thought to be wrong; and the "beryl" is suggested by some; by others "a sort of precious corundum." Emerald, to which the "smaragdus" of the LXX. and Josephus would seem to point, cannot be right, since that stone is fully as hard as the topaz. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:15-30 The chief ornament of the high priest, was the breastplate, a rich piece of cloth, curiously worked. The name of each tribe was graven in a precious stone, fixed in the breastplate, to signify how precious, in God's sight, believers are, and how honourable. How small and poor soever the tribe was, it was as a precious stone in the breastplate of the high priest; thus are all the saints dear to Christ, however men esteem them. The high priest had the names of the tribes, both on his shoulders and on his breast, which reminds us of the power and the love with which our Lord Jesus pleads for those that are his. He not only bears them up in his arms with almighty strength, but he carries them in his bosom with tender affection. What comfort is this to us in all our addresses to God! The Urim and Thummim, by which the will of God was made known in doubtful cases, were put in this breastplate. Urim and Thummim signify light and integrity. There are many conjectures what these were; the most probable opinion seems to be, that they were the twelve precious stones in the high priest's breastplate. Now, Christ is our Oracle. By him God, in these last days, makes known himself and his mind to us, Heb 1:1,2; Joh 1:18. He is the true Light, the faithful Witness, the Truth itself, and from him we receive the Spirit of Truth, who leads into all truth.</body></html>
