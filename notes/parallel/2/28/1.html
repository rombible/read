He had been, from the time that Egypt was quitted, the one and only intermediary between God and the people--the one and only priest of the nation. Now this was to be changed. Perhaps in consequence of his original reluctance and want of faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-11.htm" title="And Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?">Exodus 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/4-10.htm" title="And Moses said to the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since you have spoken to your servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.">Exodus 4:10-13</a>), perhaps on account of Aaron's elder birth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-7.htm" title="And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.">Exodus 7:7</a>), it pleased God to commit the office of ministering to Him in the tabernacle, not to Moses and his descendants, but to Aaron and those sprung from his loins. In this way Aaron and his sons were <span class= "ital">"</span>drawn near" to Moses in respect of rank, position, and dignity.<p><span class= "bld">That he may minister to me in the priest's office.</span>--Or, "that he may be priest to me." The actual investiture of Aaron with the priestly office did not take place until some time after the tabernacle was completed. It is related in Leviticus 8; and his first priestly acts are recorded in the following chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/9-8.htm" title="Aaron therefore went to the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.">Leviticus 9:8-22</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Nadab and Abihu.</span>--On Nadab and Abihu, the two eldest sons of Aaron, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-23.htm" title="And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bore him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.">Exodus 6:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-1.htm" title="And he said to Moses, Come up to the LORD, you, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship you afar off.">Exodus 24:1</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Eleazar and Ithamar.</span>--The priestly office was, in fact, continued in the families of these two. Eleazar became high priest at the death of Aaron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-28.htm" title="And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.">Numbers 20:28</a>), and was succeeded by his son Phinehas, whom we find high priest in the time of Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-13.htm" title="And the children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,">Joshua 22:13</a>) and afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-28.htm" title="And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into your hand.">Judges 20:28</a>). At a later date, but under what circumstances is unknown, the high priesthood passed to the line of Ithamar, to which Eli belonged.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-12.</span> - THE HOLY GARMENTS. The special object of the present chapter is to prescribe the form, materials, colour, etc., of the holy garments - or the attire of those who were to minister in the tabernacle at the time of their ministration. As the service of the tabernacle was about to be committed to Aaron and his sons, their selection for this office is mentioned in verse 1, and their investiture and consecration briefly touched in verse 41. Otherwise the whole chapter is concerned with the attire That of Aaron is first prescribed (vers. 4-39). It consists of an ephod (vers. 6-12); a breastplate (vers. 13-30); a robe (vers. 31-35); a mitre (vers 36-38); a coat, or tunic; and a girdle (ver. 39). The dress of his sons follows. It comprises drawers (ver. 42), tunics, girdles, and caps or turbans (ver. 40). Incidentally it is mentioned in verse 43, that drawers are also to be worn by Aaron; and, in conclusion, the neglect of this ordinance in the case of either Aaron or his sons is forbidden under penalty of death <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take thou unto thee</span>. Literally, "Make to draw near to thee." Moses had hitherto been of all the people the one nearest to God, <span class="accented">the</span> medium of communication. He was now to abdicate a portion of his functions, transferring them to his brother and his brother's sons. By this act he would draw them nearer to him than they were before. It is worthy of remark that he makes no remonstrance or opposition, but carries out God's will in this matter as readily and willingly as in all others. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-4.htm">Leviticus 8:4-30</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">From among the children of Israel</span>. The LXX. reads "And from among the children of Israel," as if others besides the family of Aaron had been admitted to the priesthood. But this is contrary to the entire tenor of the later narrative. The existing Hebrew text is correct. <span class="cmt_word">Nadab and Abihu</span>, and again, <span class="cmt_word">Eleazar and Ithamar</span>, are always coupled together in the Pentateuch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-1.htm">Exodus 24:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1, 12</a>; etc.), while a marked division is made between the two pairs of brothers. It is probably the sin and early death of the two elder (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>) that causes the separation. Of Ithamar after the death of his brothers, nothing is known. Eleazar became high priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-17.htm">Numbers 34:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-1.htm">Joshua 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-4.htm">Joshua 17:4</a>; etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-5 Hitherto the heads of families were the priests, and offered sacrifices; but now this office was confined to the family of Aaron only; and so continued till the gospel dispensation. The holy garments not only distinguished the priests from the people, but were emblems of that holy conduct which should ever be the glory and beauty, the mark of the ministers of religion, without which their persons and ministrations will be had in contempt. They also typified the glory of the Divine majesty, and the beauty of complete holiness, which rendered Jesus Christ the great High Priest. But our adorning under the gospel, is not to be of gold and costly array, but the garments of salvation, the robe of righteousness.</body></html>
