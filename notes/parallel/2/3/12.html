Moses meant to urge that he was unfit for the mission. God's reply is, "Not unfit, <span class= "ital">since </span>I will be with thee." I will supply all thy defects, make good all thy shortcomings. "My strength is made perfect in weakness."<p><span class= "bld">This shall be a token unto thee.</span>--It is in accordance with the Divine economy to give men "tokens," which are future, and appeal to faith only, (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-34.htm" title="And this shall be a sign to you, that shall come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.">1Samuel 2:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-27.htm" title="But I know your stayed, and your going out, and your coming in, and your rage against me.">2Kings 19:27</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Certainly I will be with thee</span>. Literally, "<span class="accented">Since</span> I will be with thee." Moses had excused himself on the ground of unfitness. God replies - "Thou wilt not be unfit, since I will be with thee - I will supply thy deficiencies - I will impart all the qualities thou needest - <span class="cmt_word">and this shall be a sign unto thee</span> of my power and faithfulness - this shall assure thee that I am not sending thee upon a fruitless errand - it is determined in my counsels that not only shalt thou succeed, and lead the people out, but after that, - when thou hast so done - thou and they together <span class="cmt_word">shall serve me on this mountain</span>." The "sign" was one which appealed to faith only, like that given to Hezekiah by Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-29.htm">2 Kings 19:29</a>), but, if accepted, it gave a full assurance - the second step involved the first - the end implied the means - if Moses was of a certainty to bring the Israelites to Sinai, he must first lead them out of Egypt - he must in some way or other triumph over all the difficulties which would beset the undertaking. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:11-15 Formerly Moses thought himself able to deliver Israel, and set himself to the work too hastily. Now, when the fittest person on earth for it, he knows his own weakness. This was the effect of more knowledge of God and of himself. Formerly, self-confidence mingled with strong faith and great zeal, now sinful distrust of God crept in under the garb of humility; so defective are the strongest graces and the best duties of the most eminent saints. But all objections are answered in, Certainly I will be with thee. That is enough. Two names God would now be known by. A name that denotes what he is in himself, I AM THAT I AM. This explains his name Jehovah, and signifies, 1. That he is self-existent: he has his being of himself. 2. That he is eternal and unchangeable, and always the same, yesterday, to-day, and for ever. 3. That he is incomprehensible; we cannot by searching find him out: this name checks all bold and curious inquiries concerning God. 4. That he is faithful and true to all his promises, unchangeable in his word as well as in his nature; let Israel know this, I AM hath sent me unto you. I am, and there is none else besides me. All else have their being from God, and are wholly dependent upon him. Also, here is a name that denotes what God is to his people. The Lord God of your fathers sent me unto you. Moses must revive among them the religion of their fathers, which was almost lost; and then they might expect the speedy performance of the promises made unto their fathers.</body></html>
