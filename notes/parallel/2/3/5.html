They would certainly not have been worn in Midian. Egyptians before the time of Moses, and Orientals generally, in ancient (as in modern) times, removed their sandals (or their shoes) from their feet on entering any place to which respect was due, as a temple, a palace, and even the private house of a great man. It is worthy of notice that God Himself orders this mark of respect to be shown to the place which His Presence has hallowed. On the reverence due to holy places, see the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/28-16.htm" title="And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.">Genesis 28:16-17</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Draw not nigh</span>. The awful greatness of the Creator is such that his creatures, until invited to draw near, are bound to stand aloof. Moses, not yet aware that God himself spoke to him, was approaching the bush too close, to examine and see what the "great thing" was. (See ver. 3.) On the general unfitness of man to approach near to holy things, see the comment on Exodus 19:12. <span class="cmt_word">Put off thy shoes</span>. Rather, "thy <span class="accented">sandals."</span> <span class="accented">Shoes</span> were not worn commonly, even by the Egyptians, until a late period, and would certainly not be known in the land of Midian at this time. The practice of putting them off before entering a temple, a palace, or even the private apartments of a house, was, and is, universal in the East - the <span class="accented">rationale</span> of it being that the shoes or sandals have dust or dirt attaching to them. The command given to Moses at this time was repeated to Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-15.htm">Joshua 5:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Holy</span> <span class="cmt_word">ground</span>. Literally, "ground of holiness " - ground rendered holy by the presence of God upon it - not "an old sanctuary," as some have thought, for then Moses would not have needed the information. Exodus - <span class="cmt_word">The God of thy father</span>. "Father" here is used collectively, meaning forefathers generally, a usage well known to Hebraists. (Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>, antioch, 18:4.) <span class="cmt_word">The God of Abraham</span>, etc., <span class="accented">i.e</span>. the God who revealed himself to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and entered into covenant with them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-2.htm">Genesis 26:2-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-1.htm">Genesis 35:1-12</a>). The conclusion which our Blessed Lord drew from this verse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-32.htm">Matthew 22:32</a>) is not directly involved in it, but depends on his minor premiss, "God is not the God of the dead, but of the living." <span class="cmt_word">Moses hid his face</span>. A natural instinctive action. So Elijah, on the same site (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-13.htm">1 Kings 19:13</a>) and the holy angels before God's throne in heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>). In the religious system of Rome, the augurs when discharging their office, and all persons when offering a sacrifice, veiled their heads. (See Liv. 1:18; Virg. Aen. 3:405; Juv. 6:390.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 The years of the life of Moses are divided into three forties; the first forty he spent as a prince in Pharaoh's court, the second as a shepherd in Midian, the third as a king in Jeshurun. How changeable is the life of man! The first appearance of God to Moses, found him tending sheep. This seems a poor employment for a man of his parts and education, yet he rests satisfied with it; and thus learns meekness and contentment, for which he is more noted in sacred writ, than for all his learning. Satan loves to find us idle; God is pleased when he finds us employed. Being alone, is a good friend to our communion with God. To his great surprise, Moses saw a bush burning without fire to kindle it. The bush burned, and yet did not burn away; an emblem of the church in bondage in Egypt. And it fitly reminds us of the church in every age, under its severest persecutions kept by the presence of God from being destroyed. Fire is an emblem, in Scripture, of the Divine holiness and justice, also of the afflictions and trials with which God proves and purifies his people, and even of that baptism of the Holy Ghost, by which sinful affections are consumed, and the soul changed into the Divine nature and image. God gave Moses a gracious call, to which he returned a ready answer. Those that would have communion with God, must attend upon him in the ordinances wherein he is pleased to manifest himself and his glory, though it be in a bush. Putting off the shoe was a token of respect and submission. We ought to draw nigh to God with a solemn pause and preparation, carefully avoiding every thing that looks light and rude, and unbecoming his service. God does not say, I was the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but I am. The patriarchs still live, so many years after their bodies have been in the grave. No length of time can separate the souls of the just from their Maker. By this, God instructed Moses as to another world, and strengthened his belief of a future state. Thus it is interpreted by our Lord Jesus, who, from hence, proves that the dead are raised, Lu 20:37. Moses hid his face, as if both ashamed and afraid to look upon God. The more we see of God, and his grace, and covenant love, the more cause we shall see to worship him with reverence and godly fear.</body></html>
