But perhaps it is rather a deep and mysterious statement of His nature. "I am that which I am." My nature, i.e., cannot be declared in words, cannot be conceived of by human thought. I exist in such sort that my whole inscrutable nature is implied in my existence. I exist, as nothing else does--necessarily, eternally, really. If I am to give myself a name expressive of my nature, so far as language can be, let me be called "I AM."<p><span class= "bld">Tell them I AM hath sent me unto you.</span>--I AM, assumed as a name, implies (1) an existence different from all other existence. "I am, and there is none beside me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-6.htm" title="That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there is none else.">Isaiah 45:6</a>); (2) an existence out of time, with which time has nothing to do (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-58.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am.">John 8:58</a>); (3), an existence that is real, all other being shadowy; (4) an independent and unconditioned existence, from which all other is derived, and on which it is dependent.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I AM THAT I AM</span>. No better translation can be given of the Hebrew words. "I <span class="accented">will be</span> that I <span class="accented">will be</span> (Geddes) is more literal, but less idiomatic, since the Hebrew was the simplest possible form of the verb substantive. "I am <span class="accented">because</span> I am" (Boothroyd) is wrong, since the word <span class="accented">asher is</span> certainly the relative. The Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f64;&#x3bd;</span>, explains rather than translates, but is otherwise unobjectionable. The Vulgate, <span class="accented">sum qui sum</span>, has absolute exactness. The idea expressed by the name is, as already explained, that of real, perfect, unconditioned, independent existence. <span class="cmt_word">I AM hath sent me to you.</span> "I am" is an abbreviated form of "I am that I am," and is intended to express the same idea. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:11-15 Formerly Moses thought himself able to deliver Israel, and set himself to the work too hastily. Now, when the fittest person on earth for it, he knows his own weakness. This was the effect of more knowledge of God and of himself. Formerly, self-confidence mingled with strong faith and great zeal, now sinful distrust of God crept in under the garb of humility; so defective are the strongest graces and the best duties of the most eminent saints. But all objections are answered in, Certainly I will be with thee. That is enough. Two names God would now be known by. A name that denotes what he is in himself, I AM THAT I AM. This explains his name Jehovah, and signifies, 1. That he is self-existent: he has his being of himself. 2. That he is eternal and unchangeable, and always the same, yesterday, to-day, and for ever. 3. That he is incomprehensible; we cannot by searching find him out: this name checks all bold and curious inquiries concerning God. 4. That he is faithful and true to all his promises, unchangeable in his word as well as in his nature; let Israel know this, I AM hath sent me unto you. I am, and there is none else besides me. All else have their being from God, and are wholly dependent upon him. Also, here is a name that denotes what God is to his people. The Lord God of your fathers sent me unto you. Moses must revive among them the religion of their fathers, which was almost lost; and then they might expect the speedy performance of the promises made unto their fathers.</body></html>
