For the fulfilment of the promise, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/4-29.htm" title="And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:">Exodus 4:29-31</a>. The elders appear to have been persuaded easily, and at once.<p><span class= "bld">Thou and the elders.</span>--We are not told in Exodus 5 that the elders did present themselves before Pharaoh; but it is possible that they may have done so. Or Moses and Aaron, who spoke in their name, and by their authority, may have been regarded as sufficiently representing them.<p><span class= "bld">The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews. </span>Pharaoh would readily comprehend this statement. He would quite understand that the Hebrews, being of a different race from the Egyptians, had a God of their own, and that this God would from time to time give intimations to them of His will. Such intimations were supposed to be given to the Egyptian kings occasionally by their gods.<p><span class= "bld">Three days' journey.</span>--The necessity for withdrawing to so great a distance arose from that remarkable peculiarity in the Egyptian religion, the worship of animals. Cows, or at any rate, white cows, were sacred throughout the whole of Egypt, and to kill them was regarded as a crime of the deepest dye. Sheep were sacred to the inhabitants of one nome or canton, goats to those of another (Herod. ii. 42). Unless the Hebrews retired to a place where there were no Egyptians, they would be unable to perform their sacred rites without danger of disturbance, and even bloodshed. (See below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-26.htm" title="And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: see, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?">Exodus 8:26</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The wilderness.</span>--"<span class= "ital">The </span>wilderness" to those who dwelt in Goshen was the broad sandy and rocky tract which intervened between Egypt and Palestine--the modern <span class= "ital">El-Tih</span>--a desert reckoned at three days' journey across (Herod. iii. 5). It is "a vast limestone plateau of irregular surface, projecting wedge-fashion into the peninsula of Sinai, just as Sinai itself projects into the Red Sea. It terminates in a long cliff or encampment, steep and abrupt on the south-western side, gradually falling away towards the south-east."--(<span class= "ital">Our Work in Palestine, </span>p. 275.)<p><span class= "bld">That we may sacrifice.</span>--It is idle to speculate whether, if Pharaoh had granted the request, the Israelites would have returned to Egypt after sacrificing. God knew that he would not grant it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall hearken to thy voice</span>. Moses thought they would despise him - turn a deaf ear to his words - look upon him as unworthy of credit. But it was not so. The hearts of men are in God's hands, and he disposed those of the elders to receive the message of his servant, Moses, favourably, and believe in it. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-29.htm">Exodus 4:29-31</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt come</span>, <span class="cmt_word">thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt</span>. This future is perhaps one of command rather than of prophetic announcement. The elders do not seem to have actually made their appearance before Pharaoh. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-1.htm">Exodus 5:1-4</a>.) They may, however, have authorised Moses and Aaron to speak in their name. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us</span>. Through our representative Moses. "Met with us" is undoubtedly the true meaning. <span class="cmt_word">That we may sacrifice</span>. There was reticence here, no doubt, but no falseness. It was a part of God's design that sacrifice, interrupted during the sojourn in Egypt for various reasons, should be resumed beyond the bounds of Egypt by His people. So much of his purpose, and no more, he bade Moses lay before Pharaoh on the first occasion. The object of the reticence was not to deceive Pharaoh, but to test him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:16-22 Moses' success with the elders of Israel would be good. God, who, by his grace, inclines the heart, and opens the ear, could say beforehand, They shall hearken to thy voice; for he would make them willing in this day of power. As to Pharaoh, Moses is here told that petitions and persuasions, and humble complaints, would not prevail with him; nor a mighty hand stretched out in signs and wonders. But those will certainly be broken by the power of God's hand, who will not bow to the power of his word. Pharaoh's people should furnish Israel with riches at their departure. In Pharaoh's tyranny and Israel's oppression, we see the miserable, abject state of sinners. However galling the yoke, they drudge on till the Lord sends redemption. With the invitations of the gospel, God sends the teaching of his Spirit. Thus are men made willing to seek and to strive for deliverance. Satan loses his power to hold them, they come forth with all they have and are, and apply all to the glory of God and the service of his church.</body></html>
