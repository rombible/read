(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-42.htm" title="Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely you had sent me away now empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.">Genesis 31:42</a>.) Hence St. Stephen, quoting the passage, renders it, "I am the God of thy fathers" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-32.htm" title="Saying, I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and dared not behold.">Acts 7:32</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The God of Abraham.</span>--Primarily, no doubt, the meaning was, <span class= "ital">the God who was worshipped by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; </span>but the form of the expression, "the God of Abraham," &c., indicated the continued existence of the patriarchs after death, since He can only be the God of existent, and not of nonexistent things. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-32.htm" title="I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.">Matthew 22:32</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Moses hid his face, </span>with the same feeling which made Jacob exclaim, "How dreadful is this place" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-17.htm" title="And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.">Genesis 28:17</a>). Though nothing was to be seen but an appearance as of material fire, the knowledge that God was there rendered the fire awful.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 The years of the life of Moses are divided into three forties; the first forty he spent as a prince in Pharaoh's court, the second as a shepherd in Midian, the third as a king in Jeshurun. How changeable is the life of man! The first appearance of God to Moses, found him tending sheep. This seems a poor employment for a man of his parts and education, yet he rests satisfied with it; and thus learns meekness and contentment, for which he is more noted in sacred writ, than for all his learning. Satan loves to find us idle; God is pleased when he finds us employed. Being alone, is a good friend to our communion with God. To his great surprise, Moses saw a bush burning without fire to kindle it. The bush burned, and yet did not burn away; an emblem of the church in bondage in Egypt. And it fitly reminds us of the church in every age, under its severest persecutions kept by the presence of God from being destroyed. Fire is an emblem, in Scripture, of the Divine holiness and justice, also of the afflictions and trials with which God proves and purifies his people, and even of that baptism of the Holy Ghost, by which sinful affections are consumed, and the soul changed into the Divine nature and image. God gave Moses a gracious call, to which he returned a ready answer. Those that would have communion with God, must attend upon him in the ordinances wherein he is pleased to manifest himself and his glory, though it be in a bush. Putting off the shoe was a token of respect and submission. We ought to draw nigh to God with a solemn pause and preparation, carefully avoiding every thing that looks light and rude, and unbecoming his service. God does not say, I was the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but I am. The patriarchs still live, so many years after their bodies have been in the grave. No length of time can separate the souls of the just from their Maker. By this, God instructed Moses as to another world, and strengthened his belief of a future state. Thus it is interpreted by our Lord Jesus, who, from hence, proves that the dead are raised, Lu 20:37. Moses hid his face, as if both ashamed and afraid to look upon God. The more we see of God, and his grace, and covenant love, the more cause we shall see to worship him with reverence and godly fear.</body></html>
