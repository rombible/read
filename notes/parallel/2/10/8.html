The courtiers "brought them again to Pharaoh." The courtiers, no doubt, supposed that the king would yield; and the king was prepared to yield <span class= "ital">to a certain extent.</span> But he had conceived of a compromise in his own mind, and this he hoped to impose upon Moses; hence his insidious question--<p><span class= "bld">Who are they that shall go?</span>--Pharaoh had not hitherto raised this question. He had known well enough that the demand extended to <span class= "ital">all</span> the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-8.htm" title="Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice to the LORD.">Exodus 8:8</a>); but now he pretends that there had been an ambiguity, and requires that it shall be cleared up. Moses gives him an answer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-9.htm" title="And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast to the LORD.">Exodus 10:9</a>) which takes away all further pretence of doubt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh</span>. Pharaoh did not condescend so far as to send for them, but he allowed his courtiers to bring them to him. And he so far took the advice of his courtiers, that he began by a general permission to the Israelites to take their departure. This concession, however, he almost immediately retracted by a question, which implied that all were not to depart. <span class="cmt_word">Who are they that shall go?</span> It seems somewhat strange that the king had not yet clearly understood what the demand made of him was. But perhaps he had not cared to know, since he had had no intention of granting it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-11 The plagues of Egypt show the sinfulness of sin. They warn the children of men not to strive with their Maker. Pharaoh had pretended to humble himself; but no account was made of it, for he was not sincere therein. The plague of locusts is threatened. This should be much worse than any of that kind which had ever been known. Pharaoh's attendants persuade him to come to terms with Moses. Hereupon Pharaoh will allow the men to go, falsely pretending that this was all they desired. He swears that they shall not remove their little ones. Satan does all he can to hinder those that serve God themselves, from bringing their children to serve him. He is a sworn enemy to early piety. Whatever would put us from engaging our children in God's service, we have reason to suspect Satan in it. Nor should the young forget that the Lord's counsel is, Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth; but Satan's counsel is, to keep children in a state of slavery to sin and to the world. Mark that the great foe of man wishes to retain him by the ties of affection, as Pharaoh would have taken hostages from the Israelites for their return, by holding their wives and children in captivity. Satan is willing to share our duty and our service with the Saviour, because the Saviour will not accept those terms.</body></html>
