First, the magicians were impressed, and said, "This is the finger of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-19.htm" title="Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he listened not to them; as the LORD had said.">Exodus 8:19</a>). Then a certain number of the people "feared the word of the Lord, and made their servants and their cattle flee into the houses" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-20.htm" title="He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:">Exodus 9:20</a>). Now the very officers of the Court, those who were in the closest contact with the king, believed that the words of Moses would come true, and counselled the king to yield, and "let the men go." It has been supposed that they meant "the men only" (Knobel, Cook); but this is pure conjecture. The word used, which is not that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-11.htm" title="Not so: go now you that are men, and serve the LORD; for that you did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.">Exodus 10:11</a>, would cover women and children. The officers of the Court--rich landowners mostly--would dread impending ruin if the wheat and <span class= "ital">doora</span> crops were destroyed, and would intend to counsel entire submission.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Pharaoh's servants said unto him</span>. This marks quite a new phase in the proceedings. Hitherto the courtiers generally had been dumb. Once the magicians had ventured to say - "This is the finger of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-19.htm">Exodus 8:19</a>); but otherwise the entire court had been passive, and left the king to himself. They are even said to have "hardened their hearts" like him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-34.htm">Exodus 9:34</a>). But now at last they break their silence and interfere. Having lost most of their cattle, and a large part of the year's crops, the great men became alarmed - they were large landed proprietors, and the destruction of the wheat and <span class="accented">doora</span> crops would seriously impoverish, if not actually ruin them. Moreover, it is to be noted that they interfere before the plague has begun, when it is simply threatened, which shows that they had come to believe in the power of Moses. Such a belief on the part of some had appeared, when the plague of hail was threatened (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-20.htm">Exodus 9:20</a>); now it would seem to have become general. <span class="cmt_word">A snare to us</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "a peril" - "a source of danger," the species being put for the genus. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-11 The plagues of Egypt show the sinfulness of sin. They warn the children of men not to strive with their Maker. Pharaoh had pretended to humble himself; but no account was made of it, for he was not sincere therein. The plague of locusts is threatened. This should be much worse than any of that kind which had ever been known. Pharaoh's attendants persuade him to come to terms with Moses. Hereupon Pharaoh will allow the men to go, falsely pretending that this was all they desired. He swears that they shall not remove their little ones. Satan does all he can to hinder those that serve God themselves, from bringing their children to serve him. He is a sworn enemy to early piety. Whatever would put us from engaging our children in God's service, we have reason to suspect Satan in it. Nor should the young forget that the Lord's counsel is, Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth; but Satan's counsel is, to keep children in a state of slavery to sin and to the world. Mark that the great foe of man wishes to retain him by the ties of affection, as Pharaoh would have taken hostages from the Israelites for their return, by holding their wives and children in captivity. Satan is willing to share our duty and our service with the Saviour, because the Saviour will not accept those terms.</body></html>
