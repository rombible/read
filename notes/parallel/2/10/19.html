They cannot fly far without one. It often happens that a wind blows them into the sea. Pallas says, speaking of Crimean locusts in the year 1799:--"Great numbers of them were carried [from the Crimea] by northerly winds into the sea, where they perished, and were afterwards washed on shore in heaps" (<span class= "ital">Travels,</span> vol. ii., p. 424).<p><span class= "bld">The Red sea.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">the sea of weeds,</span> or <span class= "ital">of rushes.</span> The Red Sea probably acquired this name among the Hebrews from the fact that in the time of Moses its north-western recess communicated with a marshy tract, extending as far as the Bitter Lakes, and abounding in aquatic plants of a luxuriant growth. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-3.htm" title="And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.">Exodus 2:3</a>, where the same term designates the water-plants of the Nile.)<p><span class= "bld">There remained not one locust . . . --</span>Niebuhr says of locusts in Arabia:--"Souvent il en reste beaucoup apres le depart general" (<span class= "ital">Description de l' Arabie,</span> p. 153). But, on the other hand, there are times when the whole swarm takes its departure at once. "A wind from the south-west," says Morier, "which had brought them, so completely drove them forwards that not a vestige of them was to be seen two hours afterwards" (<span class= "ital">Second Journey,</span> p. 98).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord turned a mighty strong west wind</span>. Literally, "a very strong sea-wind" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one which blew from the Mediterranean, and which might, therefore, so far, be north, north-west, or north-east. As it blew the locusts into the "Sea of Weeds," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Red Sea, it must have been actually a north-west wind, and so passing obliquely over Egypt, have carried the locusts in a south-easterly direction. <span class="cmt_word">Cast them into the Red Sea</span>. Literally, "the Sea of Weeds." No commentater doubts that the Red Sea is here meant. It 'seems to have received its Hebrew appellation, <span class="accented">Yam Suph</span>, "Sea of Weeds," either from the quantity of sea-weed which it throws up, or, more probably, from the fact that anciently its north-western recess was connected with a marshy tract extending from the present head of the Gulf of Suez nearly to the Bitter Lakes, in which grew abundant weeds and water-plants. <span class="cmt_word">There remained not one locust</span>. The sudden and entire departure of locusts is as remarkable as their coming. "At the hour of prime," says one writer, "they began to depart, and at midday there was not one remaining.", "A wind from the south-west," says another, "which had brought them, so completely drove them forwards that not a vestige of them was to be seen two hours afterwards" (Morier, 'Second Journey,' p. 98). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:12-20 God bids Moses stretch out his hand; locusts came at the call. An army might more easily have been resisted than this host of insects. Who then is able to stand before the great God? They covered the face of the earth, and ate up the fruit of it. Herbs grow for the service of man; yet when God pleases, insects shall plunder him, and eat the bread out of his mouth. Let our labour be, not for the habitation and meat thus exposed, but for those which endure to eternal life. Pharaoh employs Moses and Aaron to pray for him. There are those, who, in distress, seek the help of other people's prayers, but have no mind to pray for themselves. They show thereby that they have no true love to God, nor any delight in communion with him. Pharaoh desires only that this death might be taken away, not this sin. He wishes to get rid of the plague of locusts, not the plague of a hard heart, which was more dangerous. An east wind brought the locusts, a west wind carries them off. Whatever point the wind is in, it is fulfilling God's word, and turns by his counsel. The wind bloweth where it listeth, as to us; but not so as it respects God. It was also an argument for their repentance; for by this it appeared that God is ready to forgive, and swift to show mercy. If he does this upon the outward tokens of humiliation, what will he do if we are sincere! Oh that this goodness of God might lead us to repentance! Pharaoh returned to his resolution again, not to let the people go. Those who have often baffled their convictions, are justly given up to the lusts of their hearts.</body></html>
