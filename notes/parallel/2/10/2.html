Natural gratitude would prompt such action. But, lest the duty should be neglected, the Israelites had it at this time constantly enjoined upon them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/12-26.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say to you, What mean you by this service?">Exodus 12:26-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/13-14.htm" title="And it shall be when your son asks you in time to come, saying, What is this? that you shall say to him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:">Exodus 13:14-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-7.htm" title="Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they will tell you.">Deuteronomy 32:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-6.htm" title="That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean you by these stones?">Joshua 4:6</a>, &c):<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son</span>. The Psalms show how after generations dwelt in thought upon the memory of the great deeds done in Egypt and the deliverance wrought there. (See especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78, 105</a>. and Psalms 106; but compare also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-6.htm">Psalm 68:6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-14.htm">Psalm 77:14-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-5.htm">Psalm 81:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/114-1.htm">Psalm 114:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-8.htm">Psalm 135:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-10.htm">Psalm 136:10-15</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-11 The plagues of Egypt show the sinfulness of sin. They warn the children of men not to strive with their Maker. Pharaoh had pretended to humble himself; but no account was made of it, for he was not sincere therein. The plague of locusts is threatened. This should be much worse than any of that kind which had ever been known. Pharaoh's attendants persuade him to come to terms with Moses. Hereupon Pharaoh will allow the men to go, falsely pretending that this was all they desired. He swears that they shall not remove their little ones. Satan does all he can to hinder those that serve God themselves, from bringing their children to serve him. He is a sworn enemy to early piety. Whatever would put us from engaging our children in God's service, we have reason to suspect Satan in it. Nor should the young forget that the Lord's counsel is, Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth; but Satan's counsel is, to keep children in a state of slavery to sin and to the world. Mark that the great foe of man wishes to retain him by the ties of affection, as Pharaoh would have taken hostages from the Israelites for their return, by holding their wives and children in captivity. Satan is willing to share our duty and our service with the Saviour, because the Saviour will not accept those terms.</body></html>
