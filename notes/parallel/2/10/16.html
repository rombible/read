The visitation of the locusts was felt as far more severe than any previous one. It entirely destroyed all the remaining harvest, both of grain and fruit, and must have produced a terrible famine, had it not been for the Egyptian institution of granaries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-35.htm" title="And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.">Genesis 41:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-48.htm" title="And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.">Genesis 41:48</a>, &c).<p><span class= "bld">I have sinned</span> . . . --Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-27.htm" title="And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.">Exodus 9:27</a>. This confession is an improvement upon the former one: (1) as acknowledging a double fault--"against the Lord and against you; "and (2) as free from any attempt to put the blame, either wholly or in part, upon others. It was probably sincere at the time; but the feeling from which it sprang was short-lived.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste</span>. Literally, as in the margin, "hasted to call for M. and A." He had made similar appeals before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-8.htm">Exodus 8:8, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-27.htm">Exodus 9:27</a>), but never with such haste and urgency. Evidently, the locusts were felt as a severer infliction than any previous one. <span class="cmt_word">I have sinned</span>. So, after the plague of hail (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-27.htm">Exodus 9:27</a>); but here we have the further acknowledgment, <span class="cmt_word">against the Lord your God and against you</span>; "against the Lord," in disobeying his commands; "against. you," in making you premises and then refusing to keep them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-15.htm">Exodus 8:15, 32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-34.htm">Exodus 9:34, 35</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:12-20 God bids Moses stretch out his hand; locusts came at the call. An army might more easily have been resisted than this host of insects. Who then is able to stand before the great God? They covered the face of the earth, and ate up the fruit of it. Herbs grow for the service of man; yet when God pleases, insects shall plunder him, and eat the bread out of his mouth. Let our labour be, not for the habitation and meat thus exposed, but for those which endure to eternal life. Pharaoh employs Moses and Aaron to pray for him. There are those, who, in distress, seek the help of other people's prayers, but have no mind to pray for themselves. They show thereby that they have no true love to God, nor any delight in communion with him. Pharaoh desires only that this death might be taken away, not this sin. He wishes to get rid of the plague of locusts, not the plague of a hard heart, which was more dangerous. An east wind brought the locusts, a west wind carries them off. Whatever point the wind is in, it is fulfilling God's word, and turns by his counsel. The wind bloweth where it listeth, as to us; but not so as it respects God. It was also an argument for their repentance; for by this it appeared that God is ready to forgive, and swift to show mercy. If he does this upon the outward tokens of humiliation, what will he do if we are sincere! Oh that this goodness of God might lead us to repentance! Pharaoh returned to his resolution again, not to let the people go. Those who have often baffled their convictions, are justly given up to the lusts of their hearts.</body></html>
