On the quarter from which the present plague came, see the comment on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-13.htm" title="And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind on the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.">Exodus 10:13</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To-morrow</span>. Again a warning is given, and a space of time interposed, during which the king may repent and submit himself, if he chooses. <span class="cmt_word">The locusts</span>. The species intended is probably either the <span class="accented">Aeridium peregrinum</span> or the <span class="accented">Oedipoda migratoria.</span> Both are common in Arabia and Syria, and both are known in Egypt. They are said to be equally destructive. The Hebrew name, <span class="accented">arbeh</span>, points to the "multitudinous" character of the visitation. A traveller in Syria says - "It is difficult to express the effect produced on us by the sight of <span class="accented">the whole atmosphere filled on all sides and to a great height by an innumerable quantity</span> of these insects, whose flight was slow and uniform, and whose noise resembled that of rain; the sky was darkened, and the light of the sun considerably weakened. In a moment the terraces of the houses, the streets, and all the fields were covered by these insects." (Ollivier, <span class="accented">Voyage clans l'Empire Ottoman</span>, vol. 2. p. 424.) <span class="cmt_word">Into thy coast</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "across thy border, into thy territories." The locust is only an occasional visitant in Egypt, and seems always to arrive from some foreign country. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-11 The plagues of Egypt show the sinfulness of sin. They warn the children of men not to strive with their Maker. Pharaoh had pretended to humble himself; but no account was made of it, for he was not sincere therein. The plague of locusts is threatened. This should be much worse than any of that kind which had ever been known. Pharaoh's attendants persuade him to come to terms with Moses. Hereupon Pharaoh will allow the men to go, falsely pretending that this was all they desired. He swears that they shall not remove their little ones. Satan does all he can to hinder those that serve God themselves, from bringing their children to serve him. He is a sworn enemy to early piety. Whatever would put us from engaging our children in God's service, we have reason to suspect Satan in it. Nor should the young forget that the Lord's counsel is, Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth; but Satan's counsel is, to keep children in a state of slavery to sin and to the world. Mark that the great foe of man wishes to retain him by the ties of affection, as Pharaoh would have taken hostages from the Israelites for their return, by holding their wives and children in captivity. Satan is willing to share our duty and our service with the Saviour, because the Saviour will not accept those terms.</body></html>
