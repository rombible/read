But it was otherwise on the fourth side, towards the east. Here was to be the entrance to the court, and here consequently the line of hangings was to be broken in the middle. A curtain, similar to that at the east end of the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-36.htm" title="And you shall make an hanging for the door of the tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, worked with needlework.">Exodus 26:36</a>), but hung on four pillars instead of five, and capable of being drawn up of down, was to give admission to the court on this side, and was to occupy twenty cubits out of the fifty which formed the entire width of the court. On either side would remain a space of fifteen cubits, which was to be occupied by "hangings," similar to those on the other three sides of the court. Each of these lengths of fifteen cubits required three pillars for its support. Thus the pillars on the east side were ten, as on the west.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span>- <span class="cmt_word">The hangings of</span> <span class="cmt_word">one side.</span> Literally, "of one shoulder."

Within this enclosure the priests and Levites offered the sacrifices, and thither the Jewish people were admitted. These distinctions represented the difference between the visible nominal church, and the true spiritual church, which alone has access to God, and communion with him.</body></html>
