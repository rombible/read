Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-6.htm">Exodus 24:6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">His flesh hooks</span>. So the Septuagint, and our translators again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-13.htm">1 Samuel 2:13</a>. They would seem by the latter passage to have been three-pronged forks, the proper use of which was, no doubt, to arrange the various pieces, into which the victim was cut, upon the altar. <span class="cmt_word">His fire-pans</span>. The word used is generally translated "censers" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-14.htm">Numbers 4:14</a>: 16:6, 17, etc.), but sometimes "snuff-dishes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-38.htm">Exodus 25:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/37-23.htm">Exodus 37:23</a>). It here perhaps designates the vessels used for carrying burning embers from the altar of burnt-offering, to the altar of incense on certain occasions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12</a>). Etymologically, it means simply "a receptacle." <span class="cmt_word">All</span> <span class="cmt_word">the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass</span>. Rather, "of bronze." Bronze was the usual material of utensils and implements in Egypt (Birch, <span class="accented">Guide to British Museum</span>, pp. 13-21; 28, 29; 35-41; etc.). Copper was scarcely used without the alloy of tin which converts it into bronze; and brass was wholly unknown. A trace of iron is sometimes found in Egyptian bronze <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-8 In the court before the tabernacle, where the people attended, was an altar, to which they must bring their sacrifices, and on which their priests must offer them to God. It was of wood overlaid with brass. A grate of brass was let into the hollow of the altar, about the middle of which the fire was kept, and the sacrifice burnt. It was made of net-work like a sieve, and hung hollow, that the ashes might fall through. This brazen altar was a type of Christ dying to make atonement for our sins. The wood had been consumed by the fire from heaven, if it had not been secured by the brass: nor could the human nature of Christ have borne the wrath of God, if it had not been supported by Divine power.</body></html>
