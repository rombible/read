But the explanation of the Jewish commentators is probably correct, that what was here directed to be made was rather an "altar-case" than an altar, and that the true altar was the earth with which, at each halt in the wilderness, the "case" of shittim wood covered with bronze was filled. (So Jarchi, Kalisch, and others.)<p><span class= "bld">Foursquare.</span>--Ancient altars were either rectangular or circular, the square and the circle being regarded as perfect figures. A triangular altar was discovered by Mr. Layard in Mesopotamia, but even this had a circular top. In Hebrew architecture and furniture curved lines were for the most part avoided, probably as presenting greater difficulties than straight ones.<p><span class= "bld">The height thereof </span>. . . <span class= "bld">three cubits.</span>--<span class= "bld">A </span>greater height would have made it difficult to arrange the victims upon the altar. Otherwise the notion of perfection in form would probably have led to the altar being a cube.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - THE ALTAR OF BURNT OFFERING. From the description of the tabernacle, or sacred tent in which worship was to be offered by the priests, it followed in natural sequence, that directions should be given concerning the court, or precinct, within which the tabernacle was to stand Ancient temples were almost universally surrounded by precincts, which the Greeks called <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, whereto a sacred character attached; and this was particularly the case in Egypt, where the <span class="accented">temenos</span> seems to have been a regular adjunct to the temple (Wilkinson in Rawlinson's <span class="accented">Heradotus</span>, vol. 2. p. 202, 2nd edition). Among the chief uses of such an open space, was the offering of victims on altars, as these could not be conveniently consumed elsewhere than in the open air, on account of the clouds of smoke and the fumes of the sacrifices. As in the description of the tabernacle, the furniture was first described, then the structure, so now the altar takes precedence of the court which was to contain it. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt make an altar</span>. Rather, "<span class="accented">the</span> altar." God had already declared that he would have an altar made to him in the place where he should "record his name" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>). And, even apart from this, an altar would be regarded as so essential an element in Divine worship, that no place of worship could be without one. <span class="cmt_word">Of shittim</span> wood. God had required (1. s. c.) that his altar should be "of earth," or else of unhewn stones (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-25.htm">Exodus 20:25</a>). The command now given was to make, not so much an altar, as an altar-case (see ver. 8). There can be no doubt that Jarchi is right in supposing that, whenever the tabernacle for a time became stationary, the hollow case of the altar was rifled up with earth, and that the victims were burnt upon this. <span class="cmt_word">Four-square</span>. Altars were commonly either square or round. An Assyrian triangular one was found by Mr. Layard at Nineveh; but even this had a round top. The square shape is the most usual, and was preserved, probably in all the Temple altars, certainly in those of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-1.htm">2 Chronicles 4:1</a>) and Herod (Joseph. <span class="accented">Bell. Jud</span>. 5:05, &sect; 6). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-8 In the court before the tabernacle, where the people attended, was an altar, to which they must bring their sacrifices, and on which their priests must offer them to God. It was of wood overlaid with brass. A grate of brass was let into the hollow of the altar, about the middle of which the fire was kept, and the sacrifice burnt. It was made of net-work like a sieve, and hung hollow, that the ashes might fall through. This brazen altar was a type of Christ dying to make atonement for our sins. The wood had been consumed by the fire from heaven, if it had not been secured by the brass: nor could the human nature of Christ have borne the wrath of God, if it had not been supported by Divine power.</body></html>
