On the contrary, horns were, so far as is known, peculiar to Israelite altars. Originally, they would seem to have been mere ornaments at the four upper corners, but ultimately they came to be regarded as essential to an altar, and the virtue of the altar was thought to lie especially in them. The victims were bound to them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-27.htm" title="God is the LORD, which has showed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even to the horns of the altar.">Psalm 118:27</a>); criminals clung to them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-50.htm" title="And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.">1Kings 1:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-28.htm" title="Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled to the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.">1Kings 2:28</a>); and the blood of sin offerings was smeared upon them for purposes of expiation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-12.htm" title="And you shall take of the blood of the bullock, and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger, and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar.">Exodus 29:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-15.htm" title="And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation on it.">Leviticus 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-9.htm" title="And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:">Leviticus 9:9</a>, &c.).<p><span class= "bld">His horns shall be of the same</span>--i.e., of one piece with the rest of the altar, not separate portions attached by nails or soldering. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-19.htm" title="And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: even of the mercy seat shall you make the cherubim on the two ends thereof.">Exodus 25:19</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Thou shalt overlay it with brass</span>--i.e., with bronze. All the woodwork of the tabernacle was overlaid with one metal or another. Here a metallic coating was especially necessary, to prevent the wood from being burnt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The horns of it</span>. Literally, "its horns." Horns were not usual adjuncts of altars; indeed they seem to have been peculiar to those of the Israelites. They were projections at the four top comers, probably not unlike the horns of bulls, whence their name. Criminals clung to them when they took sanctuary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-50.htm">1 Kings 1:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-28.htm">1 Kings 2:28</a>); and the blood of sin-offerings was smeared upon them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-12.htm">Exodus 29:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-15.htm">Leviticus 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-9.htm">Leviticus 9:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-18.htm">Leviticus 16:18</a>, etc.). Victims also were sometimes, when about to be sacrificed, bound to them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-27.htm">Psalm 118:27</a>). According to Kalisch, "The horns were symbolical of power, of protection and help; and at the same time of glory and salvation." <span class="cmt_word">His horns shall be of the same</span>. Part and parcel of the altar, that is, not extraneous additions. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt overlay it with brass</span>. A solid plating of bronze is no doubt intended, such as would protect the shittim wood and prevent it from being burnt. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-8 In the court before the tabernacle, where the people attended, was an altar, to which they must bring their sacrifices, and on which their priests must offer them to God. It was of wood overlaid with brass. A grate of brass was let into the hollow of the altar, about the middle of which the fire was kept, and the sacrifice burnt. It was made of net-work like a sieve, and hung hollow, that the ashes might fall through. This brazen altar was a type of Christ dying to make atonement for our sins. The wood had been consumed by the fire from heaven, if it had not been secured by the brass: nor could the human nature of Christ have borne the wrath of God, if it had not been supported by Divine power.</body></html>
