<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-6.htm" title="Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense,">Exodus 25:6</a>), only not with such particularity. "Oil" had been required, but not "pure olive oil beaten." By this is meant the best possible olive oil--that which was obtained by "beating," or pounding in a mortar; which was free from various impurities that belonged to the oil crushed out, after the ordinary fashion, in a mill.<p><span class= "bld">To cause the lamp to burn always</span>--i.e., every night without intermission. Josephus says that three lights were kept burning both night and day (<span class= "ital">Ant. Jud., </span>iii. 7, ? 7); but there is nothing in Scripture to confirm this. The tabernacle would have received sufficient light during the daytime through the entrance curtain, which was of linen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-36.htm" title="And you shall make an hanging for the door of the tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, worked with needlework.">Exodus 26:36</a>), not to mention that the curtain may, when necessary, have been looped up. The lighting of the lamps every evening is distinctly asserted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-8.htm" title="And when Aaron lights the lamps at even, he shall burn incense on it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations.">Exodus 30:8</a>; their extinction in the morning appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-3.htm" title="And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;">1Samuel 3:3</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20, 21.</span> - THE OIL FOR THE LAMP. It has been observed that this paragraph is somewhat out of place. It would more appro priately, according to human ideas, have terminated ch. 25. But "God's ways are not as man's ways, nor his thoughts as man's thoughts." It is frequently difficult - some-times impossible - for the keenest human intellect to trace the connecting links between one portion of God's word and the next. In such cases it is best not to speculate on the nature of the connection, but to content ourselves with laying to heart the lesson which each portion teaches separately. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt command</span>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-6.htm">Exodus 25:6</a>, where the general command had been given. Here certain additions are made as to the quality of the oil which was to be brought. The oil was to be <span class="cmt_word">pure olive oil beaten</span> that is to say, it was to be olive oil purified from any admixture of that watery juice which the Romans called <span class="accented">amurca</span>; and it was to be of the kind which is obtained by mere beating or pounding in a mortar, and not by crushing in a mill. Oil of this kind, which is usually made from the unripe fruit, is reckoned much the best; it is clear and colourless, and gives a bright pure light with little smoke. <span class="cmt_word">To cause the lamp to burn always</span>. It has been supposed from this expression that the lamp must have been kept constantly burning both day and night; and Josephus declares that this was actually so, at least with three out of the seven lights (<span class="accented">Ant. Jud.</span> 3:7, 7). But there are several places m Scripture which state, or imply, the contrary. (See especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-8.htm">Exodus 30:8</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-3.htm">1 Samuel 3:3</a>.) It seems to have been the duty of the high-priest to light the lamps every evening, and to give them a sufficient supply of oil to last till daybreak, at which time "the lamp of God went out" (1 Samuel <span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>) The supposition that "one light at least was always burning" (Kalisch), because no daylight could penetrate into the structure through the <span class="accented">fourfold</span> covering, ignores the fact that light would enter through the <span class="accented">single</span> curtain at the entrance, as well as the probability that some portion of that curtain may generally have been looped up. If we regard the lamp as extinguished during the daytime, we must understand "always" here to mean "regularly every night." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:20,21 The pure oil signified the gifts and graces of the Spirit, which all believers receive from Christ, the good Olive, and without which our light cannot shine before men. The priests were to light the lamps, and tend them. It is the work of ministers, by preaching and expounding the Scriptures, which are as a lamp, to enlighten the church, God's tabernacle upon earth. Blessed be God, this light is not now confined to the Jewish tabernacle, but is a light to lighten the gentiles, and for salvation unto the ends of the earth.</body></html>
