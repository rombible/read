The belief was probably connected with the sun's rising, towards which men in early times looked anxiously. It was, however, a belief quite separate from sun-worship.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The breadth of the court on the east side eastward</span>. Rather, "in front toward the east." The Rabbinical tradition was that Adam found himself on his creation fronting towards the east, and had consequently the south on his right, the north on his left, and the west behind him. Hence, they said, the four cardinal points received the names of <span class="accented">kedem</span>, "in front" (the east); <span class="accented">yamin</span>, "the right hand" (the south); <span class="accented">akhor</span>, "behind" (the west); and <span class="accented">shemol</span>, "the left hand" (the north). For this use of all four words, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-8.htm">Job 23:8, 9</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:9-19 The tabernacle was enclosed in a court, about sixty yards long and thirty broad, formed by curtains hung upon brazen pillars, fixed in brazen sockets. Within this enclosure the priests and Levites offered the sacrifices, and thither the Jewish people were admitted. These distinctions represented the difference between the visible nominal church, and the true spiritual church, which alone has access to God, and communion with him.</body></html>
