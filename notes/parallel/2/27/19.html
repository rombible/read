There were many "vessels of the tabernacle" which have not hitherto been mentioned, as the great laver in the court (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-30.htm">Exodus 40:30</a>) with the basins for washing which must have belonged to it; the pins or pegs whereby the various curtains were extended and supported; and probably much sacrificial apparatus besides what is enumerated in ver. 3. All these were to be of bronze, the commonest metal of the time, but one very suitable for the various purposes, being, as the Egyptians manufactured it, of great hardness, yet exceedingly ductile and ready to take all shapes. Its usefulness and convenience caused it to retain its place, even in the gorgeous and "magnificent" temple of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2, 7</a>), where it was employed for the two great pillars, Jachin and Boaz, for the great laver or "brazen sea," for the mailer layers upon wheels, for the pots, the shovels, the basins, the snuffers, the spoons, and many other sacred vessels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15-45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-13.htm">2 Kings 25:13, 14</a>). Though "common," it was never reckoned "unclean," or less fitted for the service of the sanctuary than silver or gold. It had, however, its own proper place, an inferior place to that held by the more precious metals. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the pins thereof</span>. The "pins" of the tabernacle are undoubtedly the pegs or tent-pins, whereby the tent-cloth wherewith it was covered was extended and kept taut. There were also probably similar pegs or pins for cords used to keep the "pillars" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-37.htm">Exodus 26:37</a>) or tent-poles in place. <span class="cmt_word">The pins of the court</span> supported in the same way the pillars of the court (vers. 10-15). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 27:20-21 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:9-19 The tabernacle was enclosed in a court, about sixty yards long and thirty broad, formed by curtains hung upon brazen pillars, fixed in brazen sockets. Within this enclosure the priests and Levites offered the sacrifices, and thither the Jewish people were admitted. These distinctions represented the difference between the visible nominal church, and the true spiritual church, which alone has access to God, and communion with him.</body></html>
