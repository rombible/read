Such enclosures were particularly affected by the Egyptians, and were usually oblong squares, surrounded by walls, with, for the most part, a single entrance. An open space of this kind, always desirable, was absolutely necessary where the sanctuary itself was covered in, since it would have been intolerable to kill and burn victims in a confined and covered space. The altar which has been described (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/27-1.htm" title="And you shall make an altar of shittim wood, five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and the height thereof shall be three cubits.">Exodus 27:1-8</a>) was necessarily placed outside the tabernacle, and formed the chief furniture of the court, for which directions are now given.<p>(9) <span class= "bld">For the south side southward.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">for the south side upon the right. </span>(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-18.htm" title="And you shall make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards on the south side southward.">Exodus 26:18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Hangings.</span>--The word used is new and rare. It is rendered <span class= "greekheb">?????</span>, "sails," by the LXX., and seems to designate a coarse sail-cloth, woven with interstices, through which what went on inside the court might be seen. The court, it must be remembered, was open to all Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-3.htm" title="If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.">Leviticus 1:3</a>, &c.).<p><span class= "bld">Of fine twined linen.</span>--Made of linen thread, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>each thread having several strands; not "fine linen" in the modern sense.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-18.</span> - THE COURT BEFORE THE TABERNACLE. The description of the altar is (as already observed) naturally followed by that of the court which was to contain it, and in which it was to be the most conspicuous object. This is given with great clearness in ten verses, and presents scarcely any problem for solution. The court was an oblong square, three hundred feet in length and seventy-five in breadth. It was enclosed by curtains, hung on sixty pillars, placed at intervals of seven feet and a half apart. The pillars were connected by rods, and each of them fitted into a socket. There was but one entrance, which was at the eastern side, midway in it. It was thirty feet wide, and had its own curtains and its own pillars. These curtains were of similar material with those at the entrance to the tabernacle, but the hangings round the rest of the court were merely of fine white linen. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt make the court</span>. Rather, "<span class="accented">a</span> court." <span class="cmt_word">For the south side southward</span>. Rather," For the south side, upon the right." Compare the comment on Exodus 26:18. <span class="cmt_word">Hangings</span>. The word used is a rare one in this sense, quite different from those which have been employed for "curtains" or "hangings "previously (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1, 7, 36</a>). The LXX. translate by <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> "sails;" and the Jewish commentators believe a loosely woven sail-cloth to be intended. <span class="cmt_word">Fine twined linen</span>. See the comment on Exodus 26:1. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:9-19 The tabernacle was enclosed in a court, about sixty yards long and thirty broad, formed by curtains hung upon brazen pillars, fixed in brazen sockets. Within this enclosure the priests and Levites offered the sacrifices, and thither the Jewish people were admitted. These distinctions represented the difference between the visible nominal church, and the true spiritual church, which alone has access to God, and communion with him.</body></html>
