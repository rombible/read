The singular of a substantive with the article is sometimes used for the genus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-11.htm" title="And when the fowls came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.">Genesis 15:11</a>).<p><span class= "bld">He returned.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">set out to return</span> (<span class= "greekheb">??????????</span>, LXX.).<p><span class= "bld">The rod of God.</span>--An emphatic phrase. God's endowment of the rod with miraculous power had made it "the rod of God." It was the instrument by means of which most of the plagues and the other miracles were wrought (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-20.htm" title="And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.">Exodus 7:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-6.htm" title="And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.">Exodus 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-17.htm" title="And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.">Exodus 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-23.htm" title="And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along on the ground; and the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt.">Exodus 9:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-13.htm" title="And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind on the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.">Exodus 10:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-16.htm" title="But lift you up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the middle of the sea.">Exodus 14:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-5.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Go on before the people, and take with you of the elders of Israel; and your rod, with which you smote the river, take in your hand, and go.">Exodus 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-9.htm" title="And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.">Numbers 20:9</a>; &c).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His sons</span>. Gershom, already mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-22.htm">Exodus 2:22</a>), and Eliezer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-4.htm">Exodus 18:4</a>), who was probably an infant. <span class="cmt_word">Set them upon an ass</span>. Literally, "the ass," <span class="accented">i.e</span>. the one ass that belonged to him. The word might best be translated "<span class="accented">his</span> ass." When Moses is said to have "set them upon" the animal, we need not understand "all of them." Probably Zipporah and her baby rode, while Gershom walked with his father. Though horses were known in Egypt before this, they could not be used in the Sinaitic peninsula, and the employment of an ass by Moses is thoroughly appropriate. <span class="cmt_word">Returned</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> "set out to return." <span class="cmt_word">Took the rod of God in his hand</span>. This is of course the "rod" of ver. 2, which had become "the rod of God" by the miracle of vers. 3 and 4, and which God had commanded him to take to Egypt (ver. 17). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:18-23 After God had appeared in the bush, he often spake to Moses. Pharaoh had hardened his own heart against the groans and cries of the oppressed Israelites; and now God, in the way of righteous judgment, hardens his heart against the teaching of the miracles, and the terror of the plagues. But whether Pharaoh will hear, or whether he will forbear, Moses must tell him, Thus saith the Lord. He must demand a discharge for Israel, Let my son go; not only my servant, whom thou hast no right to detain, but my son. It is my son that serves me, and therefore must be spared, must be pleaded for. In case of refusal I will slay thy son, even thy first-born. As men deal with God's people, let them expect so to be dealt with.</body></html>
