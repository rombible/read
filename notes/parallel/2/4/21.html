It is conceivable that these may be simply three forms of speech, and that the actual operation was one and the same in every case. Or, three different modes of operation may be meant. It is in favour of the latter view, that each term has a period during which it is predominant. In the narrative of what happened, the action of the heart is itself predominant in the first period; that of Pharaoh on his heart in the second; that of God in the third. We may suppose that, at first, Pharaoh's nature was simply not impressed, and that then his heart is said to have "hardened itself," or "remained hard;" that after a while, he began to be impressed; but by an effort of his will controlled himself, and determined that he would not yield: thus "hardening his own heart;" finally, that after he had done this twice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-15.htm" title="But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and listened not to them; as the LORD had said.">Exodus 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-32.htm" title="And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.">Exodus 8:32</a>), God stepped in and "smote him with a spirit of blindness and infatuation," as a judgment upon him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-12.htm" title="And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he listened not to them; as the LORD had spoken to Moses.">Exodus 9:12</a>), thus, finally, "hardening" him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-18.htm" title="Therefore has he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardens.">Romans 9:18</a>). This divine action was repeated, on three subsequent occasions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-20.htm" title="But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.">Exodus 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-27.htm" title="But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.">Exodus 10:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-8.htm" title="And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.">Exodus 14:8</a>), Pharaoh's time of probation being past, and God using him as a mere means of showing forth His glory. There is nothing in this contrary to the general teaching of the Scriptures, or to the Divine Perfection.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said, etc</span>. Now that Moses had at last given up his own will and entered on the path of obedience, God comforted him with a fresh revelation,, and gave him fresh instructions as to what exactly he was to say to Pharaoh. The statements of ver. 21 are not new, being anticipated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-19.htm">Exodus 3:19-20</a>; but the directions in vers. 22-23 are wholly new, and point to the greatest of all the miracles wrought in Egypt - the death of the firstborn. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All those wonders</span>. The miracles wrought in Egypt are called <span class="accented">nipheloth</span>, "marvels," <span class="accented">mophethim</span>, "portents," and <span class="accented">othoth</span>, "signs." <span class="accented">Mophethim</span>, <span class="accented">the</span> word here used signifies something out of the ordinary course of nature, and corresponds to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> and the Latin <span class="accented">portenta</span>. It is a different word from that used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>. In "all these wonders" are included, not only the three signs of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-3.htm">Exodus 4:3-9</a>, but the whole series of miracles afterwards wrought in Egypt, and glanced at in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>. I will harden his heart. This expression, here used for the first time, and repeated so frequently in chs. 7-14, has given offence to many. Men, it is said, harden their own hearts against God; God does not actively interfere to harden the heart of anyone. And this is so far true, that a special interference of God on the occasion, involving a supernatural hardening of Pharaoh's heart, is not to be thought cf. But among the natural punishments which God has attached to sin, would seem to be the hardening of the entire nature of the man who sins. If men "do not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gives them up to a reprobate mind" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>); if they resist the Spirit, he "takes his holy Spirit from them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-11.htm">Psalm 51:11</a>); if they sin against light he withdraws the light; if they stifle their natural affections of kindness, compassion and the like, it is a law of his providence that those affections shall wither and decay. This seems to be the "hardening of the heart here intended - not an abnormal and miraculous interference with the soul of Pharaoh, but the natural effect upon his soul under God's moral government of those acts which he wilfully and wrongfully committed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:18-23 After God had appeared in the bush, he often spake to Moses. Pharaoh had hardened his own heart against the groans and cries of the oppressed Israelites; and now God, in the way of righteous judgment, hardens his heart against the teaching of the miracles, and the terror of the plagues. But whether Pharaoh will hear, or whether he will forbear, Moses must tell him, Thus saith the Lord. He must demand a discharge for Israel, Let my son go; not only my servant, whom thou hast no right to detain, but my son. It is my son that serves me, and therefore must be spared, must be pleaded for. In case of refusal I will slay thy son, even thy first-born. As men deal with God's people, let them expect so to be dealt with.</body></html>
