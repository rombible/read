When it is fully developed, the whole skin appears glossy white, and every hair is "white like wool" (Celsus, <span class= "ital">De Re Medica, </span>v. 28, ? 12). This form is said to be absolutely incurable. It was probably from the fact of Moses exhibiting a leprous hand that the Egyptians called the Israelites "the lepers," as related by Manetho (<span class= "ital">ap. </span>Joseph. <span class= "ital">contra Ap. i.</span> 26), Chaeremon (<span class= "ital">ibid., </span>i. 32), and others.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Furthermore</span>. The first sign is followed by a second, equally simple and easy of performance, and perhaps, in the eyes of the Israelites, even more marvellous. Leprosy in a developed form was regarded as absolutely incurable. (Celsus, 'De Re Medica,' 5:7-8.) Its instantaneous production and removal were contrary to all experience, and in themselves thoroughly astonishing. Further, while the first miracle was simply a sign of supernatural power - a credential, the second was a warning and a lesson. What might not he do to smite or to save on whom God had bestowed such power over the human organism? Each man would naturally fear to resist or disobey one so dangerously gifted. <span class="cmt_word">Leprous as snow</span>. The Greek name for the worst form of leprosy, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, was based on this fact of whiteness. The loathsome disease is thus described by Kalisch: - "It begins with mealy crusts and scurfy scabs, originally not larger than a pin's point, a little depressed in the skin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-3.htm">Leviticus 13:3, 30</a>), and covered with white hairs (<span class="accented">ib</span>. 3, 20). These spots rapidly spread (<span class="accented">ib</span>. 8), and produce wild [proud?] flesh (<span class="accented">ib</span>. 10, 14). The leprous symptoms appear most frequently on the hairy parts of the body, and also on members which have been ulcerously affected. When the leprosy has gained ground, <span class="accented">the whole skin appears glossy white</span> at the forehead, nose, etc., tuberated, thickened, dry like leather, but smooth; sometimes it bursts, and ulcers become visible. The nails of the hands and feet fall; the eyelids bend backwards; the hair covers itself with a fetid rind, or goes off entirely (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-42.htm">Leviticus 13:42</a>). All external senses are weakened: the eyes lose their brightness, become very sensitive, and are continually blearing; from the nostrils runs a fluid phlegm." ('Comment. on Exodus,' p. 50.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-9 Moses objects, that the people would not take his word, unless he showed them some sign. God gives him power to work miracles. But those who are now employed to deliver God's messages to men, need not the power to work miracles: their character and their doctrines are to be tried by that word of God to which they appeal. These miracles especially referred to the miracles of the Lord Jesus Christ. It belonged to Him only, to cast the power of the devil out of the soul, and to heal the soul of the leprosy of sin; and so it was for Him first to cast the devil out of the body, and to heal the leprosy of the body.</body></html>
