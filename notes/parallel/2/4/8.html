(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-27.htm" title="They showed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.">Psalm 105:27</a>, where Moses and Aaron are said to have proclaimed "the <span class= "ital">words </span>of God's signs.")

They were then to be shown the second, which would be much more astonishing to them, having no parallel in their experience. This would persuade the greater number. As some, however, might still doubt, a third sign was provided. God is patient with all reasonable doubt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The voice of the first sign</span>. Some understand "the voice of Moses as he gave them the first sign;" but it is better to regard the sign itself as speaking to them. According to the sacred writers everything that can teach us anything - day, night, the heavens, the firmament, the beasts, the fowls of the air, the fishes, nay, the very stones - have a voice. They teach us, speak to us, declare to us, cry out aloud, lift up their voice, shout, sing, proclaim God's will, whether man will hear or whether he will forbear. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-7.htm">Job 12:7, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-11.htm">Habakkuk 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-40.htm">Luke 19:40</a>, etc.) Equally, or rather much more, must a miracle be regarded as having a voice. God speaks to us by it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-9 Moses objects, that the people would not take his word, unless he showed them some sign. God gives him power to work miracles. But those who are now employed to deliver God's messages to men, need not the power to work miracles: their character and their doctrines are to be tried by that word of God to which they appeal. These miracles especially referred to the miracles of the Lord Jesus Christ. It belonged to Him only, to cast the power of the devil out of the soul, and to heal the soul of the leprosy of sin; and so it was for Him first to cast the devil out of the body, and to heal the leprosy of the body.</body></html>
