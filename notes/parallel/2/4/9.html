The English equivalent of the phrase used would be, "shall assuredly become." The signs were, no doubt, selected primarily for facility of exhibition; but they may also have been intended to be significant. The change of a rod into a serpent showed that a feeble implement might become a power to chastise and to destroy. That of a healthy into a leprous hand, and the reverse, indicated that Moses's mission was both to punish and to save; while the change of water into blood suggested--albeit vaguely--the conversion of that peace and prosperity, which Egypt was enjoying, into calamity, suffering, and bloodshed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If they will not believe also</span>. "<span class="accented">Even"</span> would be a better translation than <span class="cmt_word">"also." The river</span> is of course "the Nile." See the comment on Exodus 2:3. Of the three signs given, the first would probably convince all those who were religious, well-disposed, and fair-minded; the second, acting upon their fears, would move all but the desperately wicked, who despised Jehovah and put their trust in the gods of the Egyptians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-7.htm">Ezekiel 20:7, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-3.htm">Ezekiel 23:3, 8</a>, etc.). The third sign was for these last, who would regard the Nile as a great divinity, and would see in the conversion of Nile water into blood a significant indication that the God who had commissioned Moses was greater than any Egyptian one. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-9 Moses objects, that the people would not take his word, unless he showed them some sign. God gives him power to work miracles. But those who are now employed to deliver God's messages to men, need not the power to work miracles: their character and their doctrines are to be tried by that word of God to which they appeal. These miracles especially referred to the miracles of the Lord Jesus Christ. It belonged to Him only, to cast the power of the devil out of the soul, and to heal the soul of the leprosy of sin; and so it was for Him first to cast the devil out of the body, and to heal the leprosy of the body.</body></html>
