The word here used for "serpent," <span class="accented">nakhash</span>, is a generic word applicable to any species of snake. We cannot assume that the <span class="accented">cobra is the</span> serpent meant, though no doubt Moses, when he <span class="cmt_word">fled from before it</span>, believed it to be a venomous serpent. Various reasons for God's choice of this particular sign have been given. Perhaps the best is, that a trick of the kind was known to the Egyptian conjurors, who would be tempted to exhibit it in order to discredit Moses, and would then be discredited themselves by his stick swallowing theirs. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-10.htm">Exodus 7:10-12</a>.) It is fanciful to suppose a reference either to the serpent of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.

God gives him power to work miracles. But those who are now employed to deliver God's messages to men, need not the power to work miracles: their character and their doctrines are to be tried by that word of God to which they appeal. These miracles especially referred to the miracles of the Lord Jesus Christ. It belonged to Him only, to cast the power of the devil out of the soul, and to heal the soul of the leprosy of sin; and so it was for Him first to cast the devil out of the body, and to heal the leprosy of the body.</body></html>
