In the East, men closely related still kiss on meeting, as they did in Moses' time, and in the days of Herodotus (i. 134).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27, 28.</span> - The scene suddenly shifts. Moses is left in the wilderness to recover his strength and make such arrangements with respect to his wife and children as he thinks best under the circumstances. We are carried away to Egypt and introduced to Aaron, Moses' elder brother, of whom we have only heard previously that he could "speak well," and was to assist Moses as spokesman in his enterprise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-14.htm">Exodus 4:14-16</a>). We now find God revealing himself to Aaron also, and directing his movements, as he had those of Moses. Aaron had perhaps already formed the design of visiting his brother (see ver. 14), and would have sought him in Midian but for the direction now given him. That direction was probably more definite than is expressed in the text, and enabled him to set forth confidently, without the fear of missing his brother. At any rate, under God's guidance he went and met him in the Sinaitic district. The joy of meeting is briefly described in the single phrase "he kissed him." The meeting was followed by a full explanation, on the part of Moses, both of the nature of his own mission and of the part which Aaron was to take in it. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go into the wilderness</span>. It is scarcely possible that this can have been the whole of the direction given, since the wilderness extended from the shores of the Mediterranean to the extreme point of the Sinaitic peninsula. The sacred writers study brevity, and leave much to be supplied by the common-sense of the reader. <span class="cmt_word">He went and met him in the mount of God</span>. Compare above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>, which shows that Horeb is meant. Horeb seems to have been the name for the entire mountain region, of which Sinai was a part. Kissed him. So Esau kissed Jacob after their long separation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-4.htm">Genesis 33:4</a>), and Joseph, Benjamin and his other brethren (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-14.htm">Genesis 45:14, 15</a>). In the East men are more demonstrative than with us.
