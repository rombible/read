The passage from ver. 8 to ver. 18 corresponds exactly with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1-11</a>; that from ver. 19-34 with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-14.htm">Exodus 26:14-29</a>; that consisting of vers. 35, 36, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33, 34</a>; and the two concluding vers. with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-36.htm">Exodus 26:36, 37</a>. Under these circumstances a few mistranslations will alone be noticed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:1-38 The making of the tabernacle The liberality of the people restrained. - The readiness and zeal with which these builders set about their work, the exactness with which they performed it, and the faithfulness with which they objected to receive more contributions, are worthy of our imitation. Thus should we serve God, and our superiors also, in all things lawful. Thus should all who are in public trusts abhor filthy lucre, and avoid all occasions and temptations to covetousness.

This was the design of the tabernacle of witness, a visible testimony of the love of God to the race of men, however they were fallen from their first state. And this love was shown by Christ's taking up his abode on earth; by the Word being made flesh, Joh 1:14, wherein, as the original expresses it, he did tabernacle among us.</body></html>
