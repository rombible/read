Such dancing among Oriental nations was uniformly of a lascivious character. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-25.htm" title="And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked to their shame among their enemies:)">Exodus 32:25</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">He cast the tables out of his hands.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-17.htm" title="And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.">Deuteronomy 9:17</a>. In righteous indignation, but perhaps with some revival of the hot temper which had led him astray in his younger days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-12.htm" title="And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.">Exodus 2:12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The dancing</span>. Rather "dancing." There is no article; and as the subject had not been mentioned before, the use of the article would have been unmeaning. Dances were a part of the religious ceremonial in most ancient nations. Sometimes they were solemn and grave, like the choric dances of the ancient Dorians, and (probably) that of David in front of the Ark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5-22</a>); sometimes festive and joyous, yet not immodest, like the Pyrrhic and other dances at Sparta, and the dancing of the Salii at Rome; but more often, and especially among the Oriental nations, they were of a loose and lascivious character. In Egypt, the dancers appear to have been professionals of a degraded class, and the dancing itself to have been always sensual and indecent; while in Syria, Asia Minor, and Babylon, dancing was a wild orgy, at once licentious and productive of a species of phrenzy. We must suspect that it was this sort of dancing in which the Israelites were engaged - whence the terrible anger of Moses. He saw idolatry before his eyes, and idolatry with its worst accompaniments. In the extremity of his anger, <span class="cmt_word">he cast the tables out of his hands</span>, dashed them violently against the ground, <span class="cmt_word">and brake them</span>. For this act he is never reprehended. It is viewed as the natural outcome of a righteous indignation, provoked by the extreme wickedness of the people. We must bear this in mind when we come to consider the justice or injustice of the punishment which he proceeded to inflict on them for their sin (vers. 26-29). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 32:20 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:15-20 What a change it is, to come down from the mount of communion with God, to converse with a wicked world. In God we see nothing but what is pure and pleasing; in the world nothing but what is sinful and provoking. That it might appear an idol is nothing in the world, Moses ground the calf to dust. Mixing this powder with their drink, signified that the backslider in heart should be filled with his own ways.</body></html>
