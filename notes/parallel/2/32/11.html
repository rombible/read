(2) their destruction will give a triumph to the Egyptians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-12.htm" title="Why should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.">Exodus 32:12</a>); (3) it will nullify the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-5.htm" title="And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if you be able to number them: and he said to him, So shall your seed be.">Genesis 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/17-2.htm" title="And I will make my covenant between me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.">Genesis 17:2-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-1.htm" title="And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar.">Genesis 26:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-12.htm" title="And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.">Genesis 28:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-11.htm" title="And God said to him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of you, and kings shall come out of your loins;">Genesis 35:11</a>), causing Moses to eclipse their glory, and to be looked upon as the true patriarch and progenitor of the "peculiar people" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-13.htm" title="Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.">Exodus 32:13</a>). To these arguments he adds entreaties that God will be merciful, and change His purpose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-12.htm" title="Why should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.">Exodus 32:12</a>).<p>(14) <span class= "bld">The Lord repented of the evil.</span>--Moses' intercession was effectual. God spared the people at his desire. He is, therefore, said to have "repented"; not that He had really changed His purpose, for He had known from the beginning that Moses would intercede and that He would spare, but because He first announced a (conditional) purpose, and then announced a different one. The mode of speech is, as so frequently, anthropomorphic.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-13.</span> - Moses has three pleas wherewith he "wrestles with God:" - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Israel is God's people, for whom he has done so much that surely he will not now destroy them, and so undo his own work. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Egypt will be triumphant if Israel is swept away, and will misapprehend the Divine action. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The promises made to Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-2.htm">Genesis 17:2-6</a>; etc.), Isaac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-4.htm">Genesis 26:4</a>), and Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>), which had received a partial fulfilment, would seem to be revoked and withdrawn if the nation already formed were destroyed and a fresh start made. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:7-14 God says to Moses, that the Israelites had corrupted themselves. Sin is the corruption of the sinner, and it is a self-corruption; every man is tempted when he is drawn aside of his own lust. They had turned aside out of the way. Sin is a departing from the way of duty into a by-path. They soon forgot God's works. He sees what they cannot discover, nor is any wickedness of the world hid from him. We could not bear to see the thousandth part of that evil which God sees every day. God expresses the greatness of his just displeasure, after the manner of men who would have prayer of Moses could save them from ruin; thus he was a type of Christ, by whose mediation alone, God would reconcile the world to himself. Moses pleads God's glory. The glorifying God's name, as it ought to be our first petition, and it is so in the Lord's prayer, so it ought to be our great plea. And God's promises are to be our pleas in prayer; for what he has promised he is able to perform. See the power of prayer. In answer to the prayers of Moses, God showed his purpose of sparing the people, as he had before seemed determined on their destruction; which change of the outward discovery of his purpose, is called repenting of the evil.</body></html>
