Though the idol had been seized and its destruction commenced, though Aaron had been rebuked and put to shame, yet the revel continued. Once launched on an evil course, the bulk of the people persisted in it. Moses felt that God was openly insulted by such conduct, against which death was denounced by the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-20.htm" title="He that sacrifices to any god, save to the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.">Exodus 22:20</a>), and which might at any moment provoke God to destroy the whole people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-10.htm" title="Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of you a great nation.">Exodus 32:10</a>). He therefore proceeded to suppress the idolatry by a stern act of judicial severity--an execution on a large scale of those taken <span class= "ital">flagrante delicto. </span>Standing in the gate--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the principal gate--of the camp, he summoned to his aid those who were on the Lord's side, and gave them orders to go through the camp from end to end, and put to death all whom they found still engaged in the mad revel.<p><span class= "bld">All the sons of Levi.</span>--This must not be understood literally. <span class= "ital">All </span>the Levites would not have heard the summons of Moses, and some were evidently among those who persisted in idolatry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/32-27.htm" title="And he said to them, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.">Exodus 32:27-29</a>). In the language of the sacred writers, "all" constantly means "the greater part."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moses stood in the gate of the camp</span>.

It is evident that there were Levites among the idolaters (vers. 27, 29.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:21-29 Never did any wise man make a more frivolous and foolish excuse than that of Aaron. We must never be drawn into sin by any thing man can say or do to us; for men can but tempt us to sin, they cannot force us. The approach of Moses turned the dancing into trembling. They were exposed to shame by their sin. The course Moses took to roll away this reproach, was, not by concealing the sin, or putting any false colour upon it, but by punishing it. The Levites were to slay the ringleaders in this wickedness; yet none were executed but those who openly stood forth. Those are marked for ruin who persist in sin: those who in the morning were shouting and dancing, before night were dying. Such sudden changes do the judgments of the Lord sometimes make with sinners that are secure and jovial in their sin.</body></html>
