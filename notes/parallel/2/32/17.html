But it would seem that when Moses was summoned up into the cloud (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-16.htm" title="And the glory of the LORD stayed on mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called to Moses out of the middle of the cloud.">Exodus 24:16</a>) his faithful "minister" remained where he was, waiting for his master. He may have found shelter in some "cleft of the rock;" and the manna may have fallen about him, and sufficed for his sustenance during the forty days and nights of his master's absence.<p><span class= "bld">The noise of the people as they shouted.</span>--"Shouting" was a feature of idolatrous rites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-28.htm" title="And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out on them.">1Kings 18:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-34.htm" title="But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.">Acts 19:34</a>; Herod. ii. 60, &c.), and was in part a cause, in part a result, of the physical excitement which prevailed during such orgies. Joshua, unsuspicious of the real nature of the shouting, supposed, naturally enough, that the camp was attacked by an enemy, and that the noise was "a noise of war." But Moses, forewarned of the actual state of affairs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/32-7.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Go, get you down; for your people, which you brought out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:">Exodus 32:7-8</a>), had probably a shrewd suspicion of the real nature of the sounds. He contented himself, however, with negativing his minister's conjecture.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Joshua heard</span>. This abrupt introduction of Joshua, who has not been mentioned for seven entire chapters, is curious. Probably he had considered himself bound, as Moses' minister (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-13.htm">Exodus 24:13</a>), to await his return, and had remained in the middle portion of the mount, where he may have fed upon manna, until Moses came down from the top. <span class="cmt_word">The noise of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the people.</span> It is noted by travellers, that in all the latter part of the descent from Sinai, the plain at its base is shut out from sight; and that sounds would be heard from it a long time before the plain itself would open on the view (Stanley, <span class="accented">Sinai and Palestine</span>, p. 44). Sounds, however, which come circuitously, are always indistinct; and it is not surprising that Joshua, knowing nothing of the proceedings in the camp, should have fancied he heard a <span class="cmt_word">sound of war</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:15-20 What a change it is, to come down from the mount of communion with God, to converse with a wicked world. In God we see nothing but what is pure and pleasing; in the world nothing but what is sinful and provoking. That it might appear an idol is nothing in the world, Moses ground the calf to dust. Mixing this powder with their drink, signified that the backslider in heart should be filled with his own ways.</body></html>
