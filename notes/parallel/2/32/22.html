(1) The people compelled him; they were "set on mischief;" they made the proposal--they would have it so. (2) He threw the gold into the furnace, and "it came out a calf," as if he had not ordered the construction of the mould. In Deuteronomy, Moses informs us that Aaron's whole conduct so angered God that God would have destroyed him but for his own intercession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-20.htm" title="And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.">Deuteronomy 9:20</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let not the anger of my lord wax hot</span>.

Or "inclined to evil" (Kalisch). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:21-29 Never did any wise man make a more frivolous and foolish excuse than that of Aaron. We must never be drawn into sin by any thing man can say or do to us; for men can but tempt us to sin, they cannot force us. The approach of Moses turned the dancing into trembling. They were exposed to shame by their sin. The course Moses took to roll away this reproach, was, not by concealing the sin, or putting any false colour upon it, but by punishing it. The Levites were to slay the ringleaders in this wickedness; yet none were executed but those who openly stood forth. Those are marked for ruin who persist in sin: those who in the morning were shouting and dancing, before night were dying. Such sudden changes do the judgments of the Lord sometimes make with sinners that are secure and jovial in their sin.</body></html>
