(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm" title="And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good land and a large, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.">Exodus 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-17.htm" title="And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.">Exodus 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/6-4.htm" title="And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.">Exodus 6:4-8</a>, &c.)<p><span class= "bld">Mine Angel shall go before thee.</span>--So far as the form of the expression goes, the promise is, as nearly as possible, a repetition of the original one, "Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-20.htm" title="Behold, I send an Angel before you, to keep you in the way, and to bring you into the place which I have prepared.">Exodus 23:20</a>). But the meaning of the promise is wholly changed, as we learn from the opening paragraph of the ensuing chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/33-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Depart, and go up hence, you and the people which you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To your seed will I give it:">Exodus 33:1-3</a>). The "angel" now promised as a guide is not to be God Himself ("I will not go up in the midst of thee "), but a creature, between whom and God the distance is immeasurable.<p><span class= "bld">In the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.</span>--All sin is followed by suffering; the sequence is inevitable. God had now consented to spare His people, and to take them back into favour; but they were not to expect that matters would be with them as if their sin had not taken place. It would still be "visited upon them"--not, indeed, by instant death, but still in some way or other. The weary waiting in the wilderness for forty years may have been a part of the punishment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-33.htm" title="And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your prostitutions, until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness.">Numbers 14:33</a>); but it may also have been inflicted on different persons in many different ways.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lead</span> <span class="cmt_word">the people unto the place,</span> etc. This was a revocation of the sentence of death passed in verse 10. The people was to be spared, and Moses was to conduct them to Palestine. <span class="cmt_word">Mine Angel shall go before thee.</span> Mine Angel - not I myself (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-2.htm">Exodus 33:2, 3</a>). Another threatened punishment, which was revoked upon the repentance of the people (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 4, 6), and the earnest prayer of Moses (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 14-16). <span class="cmt_word">I will visit their sin upon them</span>. Kalisch thinks that a plague was at once sent, and so understands verse 35. But most commentators regard the day of visitation as that on which it was declared that none of those who had quitted Egypt should enter Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-35.htm">Numbers 14:35</a>), and regard that sentence as, in fact, provoked by the golden calf idolatry (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 22). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:30-35 Moses calls it a great sin. The work of ministers is to show people the greatness of their sins. The great evil of sin appears in the price of pardon. Moses pleads with God for mercy; he came not to make excuses, but to make atonement. We are not to suppose that Moses means that he would be willing to perish for ever, for the people's sake. We are to love our neighbour as ourselves, and not more than ourselves. But having that mind which was in Christ, he was willing to lay down his life in the most painful manner, if he might thereby preserve the people. Moses could not wholly turn away the wrath of God; which shows that the law of Moses was not able to reconcile men to God, and to perfect our peace with him. In Christ alone, God so pardons sin as to remember it no more. From this history we see, that no unhumbled, carnal heart, can long endure the holy precepts, the humbling truths, and the spiritual worship of God. But a god, a priest, a worship, a doctrine, and a sacrifice, suited to the carnal mind, will ever meet with abundance of worshippers. The very gospel itself may be so perverted as to suit a worldly taste. Well is it for us, that the Prophet like unto Moses, but who is beyond compare more powerful and merciful, has made atonement for our souls, and now intercedes in our behalf. Let us rejoice in his grace.</body></html>
