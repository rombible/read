For details we must refer to the terms of the promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/33-21.htm" title="And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and you shall stand on a rock:">Exodus 33:21-23</a>), which are also characterised by brevity, but still add something to the bare statements of the present passage. Moses was, no doubt, hidden and protected by God's hand in a "clift of the rock" while God's glory passed by. He was only allowed to look out from his hiding-place after the glory had passed, when he saw the remains of it--the "back parts;" even this was, however, so brilliant a vision that it left a permanent light upon his countenance, which he was fain ordinarily to conceal from the people by means of a veil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/34-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.">Exodus 34:29-35</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The Lord, The Lord God . . .</span>The new "name" of God is not a "name," as we understand the expression; it is rather a description of His nature by means of a series of epithets. At the bush He had revealed His eternal, self-existent character; in the descent on Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/19-16.htm" title="And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightning, and a thick cloud on the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.">Exodus 19:16-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/20-18.htm" title="And all the people saw the thunder, and the lightning, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.">Exodus 20:18-21</a>) He had shown His terribleness; now, in the act of pardoning His people and taking them once more into favour, He made known His attribute of mercy. The more to impress this feature of His character on Israel, He accumulated epithet on epithet, calling Himself <span class= "ital">Rakhum, "</span>the tender or pitiful one;" <span class= "ital">Khannun, </span>"the kind or gracious one," who bestows His benefits out of mere favour; <span class= "ital">Erek appayim, </span>"the long-suffering one;" <span class= "ital">Rab khesed</span>, "the great in mercy;" <span class= "ital">Notser khesed, </span>"the keeper of mercy;" and <span class= "ital">Nose 'avon, </span>"the forgiver of iniquity." Still, to prevent the fatal misapprehension that He is a Being of pure and mero benevolence (Butler, <span class= "ital">Analogy, </span>Part I., Exodus 2, p. 41). He added, to complete the description, a reference to His justice. He "will by no means clear the guilty" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-3.htm" title="The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked: the LORD has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.">Nahum 1:3</a>), and will "visit iniquity to the third and fourth generation." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm" title="You shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;">Exodus 20:5</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord passed by before him</span>. God did as he had promised in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-22.htm">Exodus 33:22, 23</a>. He made his glory pass by, Moses, as he stood in a "clift of the rock," and "covered him with his hand as he passed by," and, when he had passed, "took away his hand," and allowed Moses to look after him, and see a glorious and transcendent vision - a vision so bright and radiant, and <span class="accented">so real</span>, that the light which streamed from it settled on Moses face, and remained there (ver. 20). <span class="cmt_word">And proclaimed</span>. In his passage God proclaimed his name; not however, as in the burning bush, an actual name contained in a single word - but a description in many words of his essential nature - a description setting forth especially his three qualities of mercy, truth, and justice, but dwelling most upon the first of the three - perhaps, as most essential, for" God is love" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-8.htm">1 John 4:8</a>) - certainly, as moot needing to be prominently set forth at the time, when his favour had been justly forfeited, and but for ]]is mercy could not have been restored.

Some critics take this clause in an entirely different sense, translating "who in destroying will not wholly destroy" (Maimonides, Pool, De Dieu, Patrick), or, "who acquits even him who is not innocent" (Geddes); but the rendering of our translators (which agrees with the LXX.], is approved by Rosenmuller, Gesenius, Kalisch, Keil, and others. It seems to have been also the meaning assigned to the passage by the prophet Nahum, who quotes it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>) when he is threatening Nineveh. Visiting the iniquity. See above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>. While setting forth his attribute of mercy in all its fulness, God will not have his attribute of justice forgotten (ver, 8). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:5-9 The Lord descended by some open token of his presence and manifestation of his glory in a cloud, and thence proclaimed his NAME; that is, the perfections and character which are denoted by the name JEHOVAH. The Lord God is merciful; ready to forgive the sinner, and to relieve the needy. Gracious; kind, and ready to bestow undeserved benefits. Long-suffering; slow to anger, giving time for repentance, only punishing when it is needful. He is abundant in goodness and truth; even sinners receive the riches of his bounty abundantly, though they abuse them. All he reveals is infallible truth, all he promises is in faithfulness. Keeping mercy for thousands; he continually shows mercy to sinners, and has treasures, which cannot be exhausted, to the end of time. Forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and sin; his mercy and goodness reach to the full and free forgiveness of sin. And will by no means clear the guilty; the holiness and justice of God are part of his goodness and love towards all his creatures. In Christ's sufferings, the Divine holiness and justice are fully shown, and the evil of sin is made known. God's forgiving mercy is always attended by his converting, sanctifying grace. None are pardoned but those who repent and forsake the allowed practice of every sin; nor shall any escape, who abuse, neglect, or despise this great salvation. Moses bowed down, and worshipped reverently. Every perfection in the name of God, the believer may plead with Him for the forgiveness of his sins, the making holy of his heart, and the enlargement of the Redeemer's kingdom.</body></html>
