Moses had asked for the return of God's favour, but had said nothing of these conditions. It is God who insists on them. "Hew thee two tables." The moral law must be delivered afresh--delivered in its completeness--exactly as at the first (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Hew you two tables of stone like to the first: and I will write on these tables the words that were in the first tables, which you brake.">Exodus 34:1</a>), and even the ceremonial law must be reimposed in its main items (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/34-12.htm" title="Take heed to yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you go, lest it be for a snare in the middle of you:">Exodus 34:12-26</a>), or no return to favour is possible. Hence Moses is summoned once more to the top of Sinai, where the Law is to be delivered afresh to him, and is ordered to bring with him tables of stone like the former ones, to receive their written contents from God's hand.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">Hew thee two tables</span>.--Something is always lost by sin, even when it is forgiven. The first tables were "the work of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-16.htm" title="And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven on the tables.">Exodus 32:16</a>). the second were hewn by the hand of Moses.<p><span class= "bld">Of stone</span>.--Literally, <span class= "ital">of stones</span>--hewn, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>out of two separate stones, which could not be said of the first tables, since none knew how God had fashioned them.<p><span class= "bld">I will write.</span>--It is quite clear, though some have maintained the contrary, that the second tables, equally with the first, were inscribed "with the finger of God." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-13.htm" title="And he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them on two tables of stone.">Deuteronomy 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-2.htm" title="And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which you brake, and you shall put them in the ark.">Deuteronomy 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-4.htm" title="And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spoke to you in the mount out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them to me.">Deuteronomy 10:4</a>.) It is also quite clear that exactly the same words were written on each.<p><span class= "bld">Upon these tables.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">upon the tables.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hew thee two tables of stone.</span> Literally, "of <span class="accented">stones"</span> - two separate tables, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, made of two separate stones. Moses is required to do this with strict justice, since it was by his act that the former tables were broken (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-19.htm">Exodus 32:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Upon</span> <span class="cmt_word">these tables.</span> Literally," upon the tables," which has exactly the same force<span class="cmt_word">. The words that were in the first tables</span>. It is quite true that we have not yet been explicitly told what these words were. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-15.htm">Exodus 32:15, 16, 19</a>.) It has been left to our natural intelligence to understand that they must have been the "ten words" uttered in the ears of all the people amid the thunders of Sinai, as recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-1.htm">Exodus 20:1-19</a>, which are the evident basis of all the later legislation. We have, however, in ver. 28, and still more plainly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-4.htm">Deuteronomy 10:4</a>, and Deuteronomy 5:22, the desired statement. The fiction of a double decalogue, invented by Goethe and supported by Hitzig, and even Ewald, is absolutely without foundation in fact. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:1-4 When God made man in his own image, the moral law was written in his heart, by the finger of God, without outward means. But since the covenant then made with man was broken, the Lord has used the ministry of men, both in writing the law in the Scriptures, and in writing it in the heart. When God was reconciled to the Israelites, he ordered the tables to be renewed, and wrote his law in them. Even under the gospel of peace by Christ, the moral law continues to bind believers. Though Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, yet not from the commands of it. The first and the best evidence of the pardon of sin, and peace with God, is the writing the law in the heart.</body></html>
