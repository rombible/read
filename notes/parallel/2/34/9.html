God has promised to go up in the midst of them; will He not also promise to forgive their iniquity and sin if they offend Him in the way, and permanently to attach them to Himself by making them "His inheritance?" God does not directly answer these prayers, but indirectly accepts them by renewing His covenant with Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-10.htm" title="And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which you are shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with you.">Exodus 34:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-27.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Write you these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.">Exodus 34:27</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-26.</span> - THE RENEWAL OF THE COVENANT. Dazed, as it would seem, by the splendour of the vision which he had beheld, Moses forgot that God had already pledged himself to renew the covenant, and lead the people in person to Canaan. In his forgetfulness, he once more set himself to intercede with God on their behalf, and besought him - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That he would go up with them; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That he would pardon them; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That he would once more take them as his inheritance (ver. 9). Without replying separately to these requests, God formally renews the covenant; promises not only to go up with the people, but to work miracles for them (ver. 10), and to drive out the nations before them when they have arrived (ver. 11); and makes a brief summary of the chief points of positive observance, which he requires of them in addition to the moral law. These points may be reduced to twelve: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That no treaty of peace should be made with the Canaanite nations (ver. 12). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That all their images, altars, and groves should be destroyed (ver. 13). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That no molten image should be made to represent God (ver. 17). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> That the Passover festival should be observed as previously commanded (ver. 18). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> That the first-born should be dedicated, or redeemed (vers. 19, 20). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> That the Sabbath rest should be observed at all times of the year (ver. 21). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> That the feast of Pentecost (weeks) should be observed regularly (ver. 22). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">8.</span> That the feast of tabernacles should also be observed (<span class="accented">ib</span>,). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">9.</span> That at all the three great festivals all the males should appear before God (ver. 23). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">10.</span> That no leaven should be used with any sacrifice (ver. 25). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">11.</span> That first-fruits of all things should be offered to God (ver. 26). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">12.</span> That no kid should be seethed in her mother's milk (ver. 26). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If now I have found grace in thy sight</span>. The vision vouchsafed him makes Moses feel that he has indeed been received into favour with God. The first use which it occurs to him to make of his position is to intercede anew for his people, he, apparently, forgets that God has already promised to go with them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-17.htm">Exodus 33:17</a>), and prefers exactly the same request which he had made on the preceding day, and which had been granted. To this he adds a prayer for <span class="cmt_word">pardon</span>, and a request that God would take Israel <span class="cmt_word">for his inheritance</span>. The last phrase is a new one, but expresses perhaps no more than has been implied in such phrases as "thy people, which thou hast purchased" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a>) - "ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:5-9 The Lord descended by some open token of his presence and manifestation of his glory in a cloud, and thence proclaimed his NAME; that is, the perfections and character which are denoted by the name JEHOVAH. The Lord God is merciful; ready to forgive the sinner, and to relieve the needy. Gracious; kind, and ready to bestow undeserved benefits. Long-suffering; slow to anger, giving time for repentance, only punishing when it is needful. He is abundant in goodness and truth; even sinners receive the riches of his bounty abundantly, though they abuse them. All he reveals is infallible truth, all he promises is in faithfulness. Keeping mercy for thousands; he continually shows mercy to sinners, and has treasures, which cannot be exhausted, to the end of time. Forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and sin; his mercy and goodness reach to the full and free forgiveness of sin. And will by no means clear the guilty; the holiness and justice of God are part of his goodness and love towards all his creatures. In Christ's sufferings, the Divine holiness and justice are fully shown, and the evil of sin is made known. God's forgiving mercy is always attended by his converting, sanctifying grace. None are pardoned but those who repent and forsake the allowed practice of every sin; nor shall any escape, who abuse, neglect, or despise this great salvation. Moses bowed down, and worshipped reverently. Every perfection in the name of God, the believer may plead with Him for the forgiveness of his sins, the making holy of his heart, and the enlargement of the Redeemer's kingdom.</body></html>
