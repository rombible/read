Now, after the Israelites had displayed their idolatrous leanings, it is added that they are likewise to destroy the "altars" and the "groves." Altars were common among all the idolatrous nations, sometimes attached to temples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-32.htm" title="And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.">1Kings 16:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/21-4.htm" title="And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.">2Kings 21:4-5</a>), sometimes separate from them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-1.htm" title="And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.">Numbers 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-29.htm" title="And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.">Numbers 23:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/16-10.htm" title="And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.">2Kings 16:10-11</a>), and were used for much the same purposes as the Hebrew altars: <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>for sacrifices, bloody and unbloody, and for burning incense. "Groves"--here mentioned for the first time--were peculiar to a limited number of nations, as the Assyrians, Babylonians, Ph?nicians, Syrians, and a few others. They appear to have been artificial constructions, either of wood or stone, or both, imitative of vegetable forms, and probably emblematic of the productive powers of nature. The worship connected with the "groves" was of a peculiarly gross and licentious character. The very name, <span class= "ital">asherah, </span>was a modification of Ashtoreth, or Astarte. It is remarkable that nothing is said of destroying Canaannite temples--an indication that as yet they did not exist, and a mark of the high antiquity of the book.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye</span> <span class="cmt_word">shall destroy their altars</span>, etc. This command is more sweeping than the corresponding one in the "Book of the Covenant" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-24.htm">Exodus 23:24</a>), which expressly mentions only the "images." Here the destruction of idol-altars and idol-groves is further commanded. On idol-altars, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-1.htm">Numbers 23:1, 29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-2.htm">Judges 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-32.htm">1 Kings 16:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-26.htm">1 Kings 18:26</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Groves</span> are here for the first time mentioned. They appear to have been artificial constructions, either of wood or metal, or both, more or less imitative of trees, and regarded as emblems of the Oriental nature-deities, especially Baal and Astarte or Ashtoreth. The word translated "grove" (<span class="accented">asherah</span>) is a modification of the name Ashtoreth. The well-known "sacred tree" of the Assyrians is probably an <span class="accented">asherah</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:10-17 The Israelites are commanded to destroy every monument of idolatry, however curious or costly; to refuse all alliance, friendship, or marriage with idolaters, and all idolatrous feasts; and they were reminded not with idolaters, and all idolatrous feats; and they were reminded not to repeat the crime of making molten images. Jealously is called the rage of a man, Pr 6:34; but in God it is holy and just displeasure. Those cannot worship God aright, who do not worship him only.</body></html>
