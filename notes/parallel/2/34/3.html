On the previous occasion, Aaron, Hur, and the elders had ascended the mount part of the way (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/24-9.htm" title="Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:">Exodus 24:9-11</a>); and Joshua had accompanied his master almost to the summit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-13.htm" title="And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God.">Exodus 24:13</a>), and had apparently remained in some part of the mountain during the whole time of Moses' stay (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-17.htm" title="And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.">Exodus 32:17</a>). Now Moses was to be quite alone, and no one was to be seen in any part of the mount. The stringency of the new orders must be connected with the promised revelation to Moses of God's glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/33-21.htm" title="And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and you shall stand on a rock:">Exodus 33:21-23</a>).<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">No man shall come up with</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee.</span> This time, no one, not even Joshua, was to accompany Moses.

The present orders are even more stringent. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:1-4 When God made man in his own image, the moral law was written in his heart, by the finger of God, without outward means. But since the covenant then made with man was broken, the Lord has used the ministry of men, both in writing the law in the Scriptures, and in writing it in the heart. When God was reconciled to the Israelites, he ordered the tables to be renewed, and wrote his law in them. Even under the gospel of peace by Christ, the moral law continues to bind believers. Though Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, yet not from the commands of it. The first and the best evidence of the pardon of sin, and peace with God, is the writing the law in the heart.</body></html>
