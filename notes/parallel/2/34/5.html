Combined with this promise were two minor ones--that God would make His "goodness" pass before him, and that He would reveal to him afresh His name. The revelation of the name is recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/34-6.htm" title="And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,">Exodus 34:6-7</a>, the manifestation of the glory in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-5.htm" title="And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.">Exodus 34:5</a>. How Moses was enabled to see God's goodness pass before him is not stated. (Comp.

This section coheres closely with the last section of the preceding chapter, and must be regarded, as the historical account of how God fulfilled the promises there made by him to Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-19.htm">Exodus 33:19-23</a>). The promises were mainly two - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That he would proclaim his name to him afresh; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That he would pass by him, and let him see, after he had passed, what man might see of his glory. The fulfilment of the first promise appears in the long enumeration of attributes contained in vers. 6, 7; the fulfilment of the second is expressed with extreme brevity in the words - ,' And the Lord passed by before him" (ver. 6). Probably no further description could be given of that marvellous manifestation beyond those words in which it was promised (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-21.htm">Exodus 33:21-23</a>). Its effects were seen in that permanent reflection of God's glory on the face of Moses, which thenceforth compelled him to wear a veil mostly when he showed himself to the people (vers. 33-35). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lord descended in the cloud</span>. The cloudy pillar, which had stood at the door of the Tent of Meeting (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-10.htm">Exodus 33:10</a>), was withdrawn while Moses ascended Sinai, and probably disappeared from men's sight. When Moses reached the top, it <span class="cmt_word">descended</span> once more from the sky, <span class="cmt_word">and stood with him</span> <span class="cmt_word">there.</span> Then a voice from the cloud <span class="cmt_word">proclaimed the</span> <span class="cmt_word">name of the Lord</span> in the manner more fully stated in the ensuing verses. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:5-9 The Lord descended by some open token of his presence and manifestation of his glory in a cloud, and thence proclaimed his NAME; that is, the perfections and character which are denoted by the name JEHOVAH. The Lord God is merciful; ready to forgive the sinner, and to relieve the needy. Gracious; kind, and ready to bestow undeserved benefits. Long-suffering; slow to anger, giving time for repentance, only punishing when it is needful. He is abundant in goodness and truth; even sinners receive the riches of his bounty abundantly, though they abuse them. All he reveals is infallible truth, all he promises is in faithfulness. Keeping mercy for thousands; he continually shows mercy to sinners, and has treasures, which cannot be exhausted, to the end of time. Forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and sin; his mercy and goodness reach to the full and free forgiveness of sin. And will by no means clear the guilty; the holiness and justice of God are part of his goodness and love towards all his creatures. In Christ's sufferings, the Divine holiness and justice are fully shown, and the evil of sin is made known. God's forgiving mercy is always attended by his converting, sanctifying grace. None are pardoned but those who repent and forsake the allowed practice of every sin; nor shall any escape, who abuse, neglect, or despise this great salvation. Moses bowed down, and worshipped reverently. Every perfection in the name of God, the believer may plead with Him for the forgiveness of his sins, the making holy of his heart, and the enlargement of the Redeemer's kingdom.</body></html>
