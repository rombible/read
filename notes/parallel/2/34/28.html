The long time is, at first sight, surprising, since there were now no instructions to be given. But we learn from Deuteronomy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/9-18.htm" title="Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.">Exodus 9:18-19</a>) that it was required for an earnest and prolonged intercession by Moses on behalf of his nation, which ultimately prevailed with God, and induced Him to put away His "anger and hot displeasure."<p><span class= "bld">He did neither eat bread, nor drink water.</span>--A similar fast had been kept on the previous occasion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-9.htm" title="When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I stayed in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:">Deuteronomy 9:9</a>), though it is not mentioned in Exodus. Fasts of this extraordinary duration are only recorded of Moses, of Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-8.htm" title="And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God.">1Kings 19:8</a>), and of our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-2.htm" title="And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungered.">Matthew 4:2</a>). They are absolutely miraculous, and modern attempts to rival them are viewed by scientific men as deriving such apparent success as may have attended them from imposture.<p><span class= "bld">He wrote upon the tables.</span>--It has been concluded from this statement that Moses engraved the words upon the second tables; and the passage, if it stood alone, would certainly admit, and, indeed, naturally suggest, this meaning. But the Hebrew idiom allows us to regard Jehovah as the nominative to the verb "wrote;" and it is necessary so to do in order to bring the passage into agreement with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Hew you two tables of stone like to the first: and I will write on these tables the words that were in the first tables, which you brake.">Exodus 34:1</a>. and with <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-2.htm" title="And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which you brake, and you shall put them in the ark.">Deuteronomy 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-4.htm" title="And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spoke to you in the mount out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them to me.">Deuteronomy 10:4</a>. Thus the second tables are to be viewed as "written with the finger of God" no less than the first (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm" title="And he gave to Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him on mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.">Exodus 31:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-16.htm" title="And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven on the tables.">Exodus 32:16</a>).<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights</span>. As on the former occasion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>). The patience and faith of the people was tested by this second long delay. Happily, they stood the test; and on Moses' final descent from Sinai the Israelites were found expectant and obedient (vers. 30-32). <span class="cmt_word">He did neither eat bread nor drink water</span>. This was so also on the former occasion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-9.htm">Deuteronomy 9:9</a>), though it is not mentioned in Exodus. The near presence of God sustained the vital powers and made food unnecessary. Moses, Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8</a>), and our Lord have alone accomplished a fast of this duration. Modern parodies are not held by scientific men to belong to the category of established facts. <span class="cmt_word">He wrote upon the tables</span>. It has been argued from this expression that Moses wrote the words on the second tables; and it would be natural so to understand the passage, had nothing else been said on the subject. But in ver. 1 we are told that "God said, I will write upon these tables;" and the same is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-2.htm">Deuteronomy 10:2</a>. Moreover in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-4.htm">Deuteronomy 10:4</a>, it is distinctly declared "He" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God) "wrote on the tables according to the first writing." We must therefore regard "he" in this passage as meaning "the Lord," which is quite possible according to the Hebrew idiom. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:28-35 Near and spiritual communion with God improves the graces of a renewed and holy character. Serious godliness puts a lustre upon a man's countenance, such as commands esteem and affection. The vail which Moses put on, marked the obscurity of that dispensation, compared with the gospel dispensation of the New Testament. It was also an emblem of the natural vail on the hearts of men respecting spiritual things. Also the vail that was and is upon the nation of Israel, which can only be taken away by the Spirit of the Lord showing to them Christ, as the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth. Fear and unbelief would put the vail before us, they would hinder our free approach to the mercy-seat above. We should spread our wants, temporal and spiritual, fully before our heavenly Father; we should tell him our hinderances, struggles, trails, and temptations; we should acknowledge our offences.</body></html>
