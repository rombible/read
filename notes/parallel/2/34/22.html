(See Note 1 on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-16.htm" title="And the feast of harvest, the first fruits of your labors, which you have sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when you have gathered in your labors out of the field.">Exodus 23:16</a>.) The special offering to be made at the feast consisted of "two wave loaves of fine flour, baken with leaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-17.htm" title="You shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baked with leaven; they are the first fruits to the LORD.">Leviticus 23:17</a>), which were "the first-fruits of the wheat harvest."<p><span class= "bld">And the feast of ingathering.</span>--Called also "the feast of tabernacles" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-34.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days to the LORD.">Leviticus 23:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-13.htm" title="You shall observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that you have gathered in your corn and your wine:">Deuteronomy 16:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-16.htm" title="Three times in a year shall all your males appear before the LORD your God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the LORD empty:">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-10.htm" title="And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,">Deuteronomy 31:10</a>, &c.), on account of the command to "dwell in booths seven days" during its continuance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-42.htm" title="You shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths:">Leviticus 23:42</a>). On the character of the festival see Note 2 on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-16.htm" title="And the feast of harvest, the first fruits of your labors, which you have sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when you have gathered in your labors out of the field.">Exodus 23:16</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of the first-fruits</span>. There is here an unfortunate ambiguity. The English reader naturally supposes that three festivals are mentioned - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That of weeks; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That of the first-fruits of wheat harvest; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That of in-gathering. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But in reality the feast of weeks is that of the first-fruits of wheat harvest. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-17.htm">Leviticus 23:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-26.htm">Numbers 28:26</a>. The observance of this feast, as well as that of the feast of in-gathering, was commanded in the "Book of the Covenant" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:18-27 Once a week they must rest, even in ploughing time, and in harvest. All worldly business must give way to that holy rest; even harvest work will prosper the better, for the religious observance of the sabbath day in harvest time. We must show that we prefer our communion with God, and our duty to him, before the business or the joy of harvest. Thrice a year they must appear before the Lord God, the God of Israel. Canaan was a desirable land, and the neighbouring nations were greedy; yet God says, They shall not desire it. Let us check all sinful desires against God and his glory, in our hearts, and then trust him to check all sinful desires in the hearts of others against us. The way of duty is the way of safety. Those who venture for him never lose by him. Three feasts are here mentioned: 1. The Passover, in remembrance of the deliverance out of Egypt. 2. The feast of weeks, or the feast of Pentecost; added to it is the law of the first-fruits. 3. The feast of in-gathering, or the feast of Tabernacles. Moses is to write these words, that the people might know them better. We can never be enough thankful to God for the written word. God would make a covenant with Israel, in Moses as a mediator. Thus the covenant of grace is made with believers through Christ.</body></html>
