At first it was the "land of Canaan" alone which they were to receive (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/12-5.htm" title="And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.">Genesis 12:5-7</a>); but subsequently the promise was extended, and made to include the entire tract of territory between "the river of Egypt" (the Nile) and "the great river, the river Euphrates" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm" title="In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To your seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:">Genesis 15:18</a>). In remarkable parallelism with this double promise was the double fulfilment. At first Canaan alone was occupied, but under David and Solomon the borders were greatly enlarged; and "Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river (Euphrates) unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm" title="And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.">1Kings 4:21</a>). The rebellion of Jeroboam, and the establishment of the "kingdom of Israel," caused a contraction of the land to its original limits; but Menahem seems once more to have carried the dominion of Israel to the Euphrates (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-16.htm" title="Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up.">2Kings 15:16</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Neither shall any man desire thy land.</span>--It was a part of the unwritten law of the Greeks that free passage should be given to all who were on their way to or from any of the great Pan-Hellenic festivals. But the present promise went beyond any such understanding. It secured the territory of Israel from all attack at such seasons, and must have been enforced miraculously by that providential government which God exercises over "all the nations upon the earth<span class= "ital">" </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/67-4.htm" title="O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for you shall judge the people righteously, and govern the nations on earth. Selah.">Psalm 67:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will... enlarge thy borders</span>. The original promise to Abraham was to give to his seed "the land of Canaan" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-5.htm">Genesis 12:5-7</a>). Afterwards this promise was enlarged, and he was told that the land assigned them was the entire tract between the Nile and the Euphrates (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>). And practically, they took possession first of the one, while at a later date their border was enlarged, and they became masters of the other. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-26.htm">2 Chronicles 9:26</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">any man desire thy land</span>, etc. This promise is nowhere else made. It would serve as a great encouragement to the proper observance of the festivals. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:18-27 Once a week they must rest, even in ploughing time, and in harvest. All worldly business must give way to that holy rest; even harvest work will prosper the better, for the religious observance of the sabbath day in harvest time. We must show that we prefer our communion with God, and our duty to him, before the business or the joy of harvest. Thrice a year they must appear before the Lord God, the God of Israel. Canaan was a desirable land, and the neighbouring nations were greedy; yet God says, They shall not desire it. Let us check all sinful desires against God and his glory, in our hearts, and then trust him to check all sinful desires in the hearts of others against us. The way of duty is the way of safety. Those who venture for him never lose by him. Three feasts are here mentioned: 1. The Passover, in remembrance of the deliverance out of Egypt. 2. The feast of weeks, or the feast of Pentecost; added to it is the law of the first-fruits. 3. The feast of in-gathering, or the feast of Tabernacles. Moses is to write these words, that the people might know them better. We can never be enough thankful to God for the written word. God would make a covenant with Israel, in Moses as a mediator. Thus the covenant of grace is made with believers through Christ.</body></html>
