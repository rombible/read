It was so fundamental to the entire polity, that it naturally held a place in every section of the legislation. We have already found it (1) propounded at the giving of the manna (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/16-22.htm" title="And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.">Exodus 16:22-30</a>); (2) reasserted in the fourth commandment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/20-8.htm" title="Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.">Exodus 20:8-11</a>); (3) introduced into the "Book of the Covenant" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-12.htm" title="Six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you shall rest: that your ox and your ass may rest, and the son of your handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.">Exodus 23:12</a>); and (4) appended to the directions given for the construction of the Tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/31-13.htm" title="Speak you also to the children of Israel, saying, Truly my sabbaths you shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I am the LORD that does sanctify you.">Exodus 31:13-17</a>).<p><span class= "bld">In earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.</span>--"Earing-time" is ploughing time, "to ear" being an old English verb, etymologically connected with the Greek <span class= "greekheb">???</span> and the Latin <span class= "ital">aro. </span>(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-6.htm" title="For these two years has the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be ripening nor harvest.">Genesis 45:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-4.htm" title="And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer to a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley:">Deuteronomy 21:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-12.htm" title="And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.">1Samuel 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-24.htm" title="The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.">Isaiah 30:24</a>.) There was a special temptation to trench on the Sabbatical rest at the times most critical in respect to agricultural operations.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Six days</span>, etc. This is repeated from the "Book of the Covenant" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-12.htm">Exodus 23:12</a>), but with a remarkable addition - <span class="cmt_word">in earing time and in harvest thou shalt</span> <span class="cmt_word">rest.</span> "Earing time" is "ploughing time" - to "ear" being to "plough" in Old English, a word cognate with the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span> and the Latin are; and the command to rest both then and at harvest time is a command not to break the Sabbath rest at the seasons when it might seem most necessary so to do The temptation to "save the harvest" is readily intelligible to Englishmen. To appreciate the other temptation, we require to know the peculiar circumstances of the East. It is necessary there to complete the ploughing before the spring rains are over. These last but a short time; and when they are once past no rain can be looked for till the autumn. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:18-27 Once a week they must rest, even in ploughing time, and in harvest. All worldly business must give way to that holy rest; even harvest work will prosper the better, for the religious observance of the sabbath day in harvest time. We must show that we prefer our communion with God, and our duty to him, before the business or the joy of harvest. Thrice a year they must appear before the Lord God, the God of Israel. Canaan was a desirable land, and the neighbouring nations were greedy; yet God says, They shall not desire it. Let us check all sinful desires against God and his glory, in our hearts, and then trust him to check all sinful desires in the hearts of others against us. The way of duty is the way of safety. Those who venture for him never lose by him. Three feasts are here mentioned: 1. The Passover, in remembrance of the deliverance out of Egypt. 2. The feast of weeks, or the feast of Pentecost; added to it is the law of the first-fruits. 3. The feast of in-gathering, or the feast of Tabernacles. Moses is to write these words, that the people might know them better. We can never be enough thankful to God for the written word. God would make a covenant with Israel, in Moses as a mediator. Thus the covenant of grace is made with believers through Christ.</body></html>
