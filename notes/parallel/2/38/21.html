Before dismissing the subject of the construction of the tabernacle, Moses places on record the sum of the gold, silver and bronze contributed and consumed in the work. At the same time he informs us who was the accountant by whom the sum was made up (ver. 21), and what were the portions of the work formed of each metal (vers. 24, 27, 28, 30, 31). Incidentally he mentions the number of the congregation at this period (ver. 26), and the weight of the "sockets" or "bases" (ver. 27). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is the sum</span>. Or "numbering" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-63.htm">Numbers 26:63</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The tabernacle of testimony</span>. The tabernacle, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of which the great glory was that it contained "the testimony" or "Two Tables."

Literally "a service of the Levites by the hand of Ithamar," etc. - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "a service which was performed by the Levites at the command of Ithamar." It is somewhat remarkable that the direction of the Levites should be assigned to Ithamar, rather than to Nadab or Abihu. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/38.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>38:21-31 The foundation of massy pieces of silver showed the solidity and purity of the truth upon which the church is founded. Let us regard the Lord Jesus Christ while reading of the furniture of the tabernacle. While looking at the altar of burnt-offering, let us see Jesus. In him, his righteousness, and salvation, is a full and sufficient offering for sin. In the laver of regeneration, by his Holy Spirit, let our souls be washed, and they shall be clean; and as the people offered willingly, so may our souls be made willing. Let us be ready to part with any thing, and count all but loss to win Christ.</body></html>
