If the "shekel of the sanctuary" weighed, as is generally supposed, about 220 grains troy, the value of the silver contributed would have been 40,000, or a little under. It was contributed by "them that were numbered of the congregation," each of whom paid a bekah, or half a shekel. (See above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/30-12.htm" title="When you take the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul to the LORD, when you number them; that there be no plague among them, when you number them.">Exodus 30:12-16</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The silver</span>. The silver seems to have amounted to about four times the weight of the gold; but the value of it was very much less, not exceeding &pound;40,000 of our money (Cook). It may seem surprising that this should have been so; but there are grounds for believing that both in Africa and in Asia gold was more plentiful than silver in the early ages. And it is certainly much more suitable for ornaments. <span class="cmt_word">Of them that were numbered</span>. See above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12-16</a>. The silver for the sanctuary was collected by a compulsory tax, of the nature of a church-rate. This produced the amount here given, No estimate is made of the weight of the silver freewill offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-24.htm">Exodus 35:24</a>), nor is any account given of their application. It has been suggested that they were returned to the donors as superfluous, which is certainly possible, <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/38.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>38:21-31 The foundation of massy pieces of silver showed the solidity and purity of the truth upon which the church is founded. Let us regard the Lord Jesus Christ while reading of the furniture of the tabernacle. While looking at the altar of burnt-offering, let us see Jesus. In him, his righteousness, and salvation, is a full and sufficient offering for sin. In the laver of regeneration, by his Holy Spirit, let our souls be washed, and they shall be clean; and as the people offered willingly, so may our souls be made willing. Let us be ready to part with any thing, and count all but loss to win Christ.</body></html>
