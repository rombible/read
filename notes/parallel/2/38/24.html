In this case the gold employed in the Tabernacle would have been worth nearly 320,000. Some, however, reduce the estimate to 175,000 (Cook), and others to 132,000 (Thenius). In any case the amount was remarkable, and indicated at once the liberal spirit which animated the people and the general feeling that a lavish expenditure was required by the occasion. There is no difficulty in supposing that the Israelites possessed at the time gold to the (highest) value estimated, since they had carried with them out of Egypt, besides their ancestral wealth, a vast amount of gold and silver ornaments, freely given to them by the Egyptians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-22.htm" title="But every woman shall borrow of her neighbor, and of her that sojournes in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and you shall put them on your sons, and on your daughters; and you shall spoil the Egyptians.">Exodus 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/12-35.htm" title="And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:">Exodus 12:35-36</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The gold</span>. The value of the gold has been estimated by Canon Cook at &pound;175,075 13s. 0d. of our money; by Thenius at 877,300 Prussian thalers, or about &pound;131,595. It was certainly under &pound;200,000. De Wette and others have argued that the possession of so large a sum in gold at this time by the Hebrew nation is inconceivable. But most critics are of a different opinion. Gold was very abundant in Egypt at the period, being imported from Ethiopia, a rich gold-producing country (Herod. 3:23; Diod. Sic. 3:11), as well as taken in tribute from the nations of Asia. The wealth of Rhampsinitus (Rameses III.), a little later than the exodus, was enormous (Herod. 2:121; Rawlinson, <span class="accented">History of Egypt</span>, vol. 2. pp. 368, 378). According to the preceding narrative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35, 36</a>) much of the wealth of Egypt had, at the moment of their quitting the country, passed from the Egyptians to the Hebrews. If they numbered two millions of souls, their gold ornaments are likely to have been worth very much more than &pound;200,000 of our money. On <span class="cmt_word">the shekel of the sanctuary</span>, see the comment upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/38.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>38:21-31 The foundation of massy pieces of silver showed the solidity and purity of the truth upon which the church is founded. Let us regard the Lord Jesus Christ while reading of the furniture of the tabernacle. While looking at the altar of burnt-offering, let us see Jesus. In him, his righteousness, and salvation, is a full and sufficient offering for sin. In the laver of regeneration, by his Holy Spirit, let our souls be washed, and they shall be clean; and as the people offered willingly, so may our souls be made willing. Let us be ready to part with any thing, and count all but loss to win Christ.</body></html>
