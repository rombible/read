It forms no part of the "Song of Moses." Originally, perhaps, when that song was a separate document, it was appended as an historical comment, showing the occasion on which the poem was composed. When the records of Moses were collected--either by himself, towards the close of his life, or by Joshua--the addition was kept, although it had become unnecessary for the original purpose. As it stands, it emphasises the great fact of Israel's final deliverance--the nucleus around which Exodus gathers itself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-21.</span> - <span class="accented">Sequel to the Song</span>. The "sequel" treats of two quite separate masters. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> It asserts, in verse 19, the historic groundwork of the song, reiterating in a condensed form the three principal facts of the presage - already recorded in ch. 14. - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> Israel's safe transit across the sea-bed; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> the pursuit attempted by the Egyptian chariot-force; end <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> the return of the waters upon the pursuers by God's providential action. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> It relates, in verses 20 and 21, the part taken by Miriam in the recitation of the ode, which has been noticed in the "introduction" to the chapter. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The horse of Pharaoh, with his chariots, and with his horsemen</span>. Rather, "with his chariots, and with his chariot men."

See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-26.htm">Exodus 14:26, 27</a>; and Exodus 15:10. The waters did not merely return to their natural place when the east wind ceased to blow, but were "brought back" by miraculous power, and with abnormal rapidity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-21 This song is the most ancient we know of. It is a holy song, to the honour of God, to exalt his name, and celebrate his praise, and his only, not in the least to magnify any man. Holiness to the Lord is in every part of it. It may be considered as typical, and prophetical of the final destruction of the enemies of the church. Happy the people whose God is the Lord. They have work to do, temptations to grapple with, and afflictions to bear, and are weak in themselves; but his grace is their strength. They are often in sorrow, but in him they have comfort; he is their song. Sin, and death, and hell threaten them, but he is, and will be their salvation. The Lord is a God of almighty power, and woe to those that strive with their Maker! He is a God of matchless perfection; he is glorious in holiness; his holiness is his glory. His holiness appears in the hatred of sin, and his wrath against obstinate sinners. It appears in the deliverance of Israel, and his faithfulness to his own promise. He is fearful in praises; that which is matter of praise to the servants of God, is very dreadful to his enemies. He is doing wonders, things out of the common course of nature; wondrous to those in whose favour they are wrought, who are so unworthy, that they had no reason to expect them. There were wonders of power and wonders of grace; in both, God was to be humbly adored.</body></html>
