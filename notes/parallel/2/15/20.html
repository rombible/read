Examples of other "prophetesses" will be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-4.htm" title="And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.">Judges 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-14.htm" title="So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.">2Kings 22:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-3.htm" title="And I went to the prophetess; and she conceived, and bore a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz.">Isaiah 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-36.htm" title="And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;">Luke 2:36</a>. In the early Christian Church there was an order of "deaconesses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-1.htm" title="I commend to you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:">Romans 16:1</a>; <span class= "ital">Apost. Const., </span>vi. 17). The office of "prophetess" seems to have been permitted to women in Egypt, though that of "priestess" was, until Ptolemaic times, forbidden them.<p><span class= "bld">The sister of Aaron.</span>--She is called "sister of Aaron," rather than of Moses, because Aaron was the head of the family (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-20.htm" title="And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years.">Exodus 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-7.htm" title="And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.">Exodus 7:7</a>). There is no reasonable doubt that she was the sister who kept watch on Moses when he was in the ark of bulrushes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/2-3.htm" title="And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.">Exodus 2:3-8</a>). On her later history, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/12-1.htm" title="And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.">Numbers 12:1-15</a>. The prophet Micah regarded her as having had a part in the work of Israel's deliverance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-4.htm" title="For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of servants; and I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.">Micah 6:4</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Timbrels and with dances.</span>--By "timbrels" are meant tambours, or tambourines, favourite instruments in Egypt, and usually played by women there (Wilkinson: <span class= "ital">Ancient Egyptians, </span>vol. i., p. 93). The combination of music with song in religious worship, here for the first time brought before us, became the fixed rule of the Tabernacle service from the time of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-15.htm" title="So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.">2Samuel 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-5.htm" title="Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith.">1Chronicles 23:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/25-1.htm" title="Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their service was:">1Chronicles 25:1-6</a>), and was adopted into the Temple service from its first establishment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-12.htm" title="Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brothers, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)">2Chronicles 5:12</a>). Sanctioned under the new covenant by the general praise of psalmody, and by the representations given in the Apocalypse of the Church triumphant in heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-8.htm" title="And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of saints.">Revelation 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/14-2.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:">Revelation 14:2-3</a>), it has always maintained itself in the Christian Church, and still holds its ground firmly. Dancing, on the contrary, though adopted into religious worship by many nations, sanctioned by the present passage, by the example of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-16.htm" title="And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.">2Samuel 6:16</a>), and by expressions in the Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/149-3.htm" title="Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises to him with the tambourine and harp.">Psalm 149:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/150-4.htm" title="Praise him with the tambourine and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs.">Psalm 150:4</a>), has never found an entrance into Christian ceremonial, unless among a few fanatic sects. The reason of this is to be found in the abuses which, through human infirmity, became by degrees connected with the practice, causing it to become unfit for a religious purpose. In the primitive times, however, solemn and stately dances were deemed appropriate to festival periods and religious rejoicings, and among the more moral tribes and nations had nothing unseemly about them.<p>The arrangement of the choir on this occasion into two bands--one of males, the other of females--and the combined employment of music, song, and dancing by the female band, are in close accord with Egyptian customs.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Miriam, the prophetess</span>. Miriam is regarded by the prophet <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-4.htm">Micah 6:4</a>, as having had a share in the deliverance of Israel, and claims the prophetic gift in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-2.htm">Numbers 12:2</a>. Her claim appears to be allowed both in the present passage, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6-8</a>. where the degree of her inspiration is placed below that of Moses. She is the first woman whom the Bible honours with the title of "prophetess." Prophetesses were common in Egypt at a much earlier date; and thus, that a woman should have the gift would have seemed no strange thing to the Hebrews. For examples of other prophetesses, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-4.htm">Judges 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-14.htm">2 Kings 22:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-3.htm">Isaiah 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-36.htm">Luke 2:36</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The sister of Aaron</span>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-59.htm">Numbers 26:59</a>. Miriam is generally regarded as the sister of Moses mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-4.htm">Exodus 2:4-8</a>, whose name is not there given. If so, she was considerably older than either Moses or Aaron. Took a timbrel By "a timbrel" our translators meant what is now called "a tambourine." Such instruments were common in Egypt (Wilkinson, Ancient Egyptians, vol. 1. p. 93), and in the representations are generally played by women. The separation of the men and women into distinct bands was an Egyptian custom; as likewise was the execution of dances by performers who accompanied their steps with music (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> vol. it. pp. 235, 301). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-21 This song is the most ancient we know of. It is a holy song, to the honour of God, to exalt his name, and celebrate his praise, and his only, not in the least to magnify any man. Holiness to the Lord is in every part of it. It may be considered as typical, and prophetical of the final destruction of the enemies of the church. Happy the people whose God is the Lord. They have work to do, temptations to grapple with, and afflictions to bear, and are weak in themselves; but his grace is their strength. They are often in sorrow, but in him they have comfort; he is their song. Sin, and death, and hell threaten them, but he is, and will be their salvation. The Lord is a God of almighty power, and woe to those that strive with their Maker! He is a God of matchless perfection; he is glorious in holiness; his holiness is his glory. His holiness appears in the hatred of sin, and his wrath against obstinate sinners. It appears in the deliverance of Israel, and his faithfulness to his own promise. He is fearful in praises; that which is matter of praise to the servants of God, is very dreadful to his enemies. He is doing wonders, things out of the common course of nature; wondrous to those in whose favour they are wrought, who are so unworthy, that they had no reason to expect them. There were wonders of power and wonders of grace; in both, God was to be humbly adored.</body></html>
