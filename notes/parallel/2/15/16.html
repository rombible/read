Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-25.htm">Deuteronomy 11:25</a>. The Edomites of Mount Seir and the Moabites gave Israel a free passage through their borders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-4.htm">Deuteronomy 2:4-8, 18, 29</a>), being afraid to oppose them. <span class="cmt_word">Till thy people pass over, O Lord</span>. Some see in this an anticipation of the crossing of Jordan; but perhaps Moses meant no more than the crossing of the Canaanite frontier, in some place or other, which must take place if the urea was to be occupied. The event made the expression used peculiarly appropriate. <span class="cmt_word">When thou hast purchased</span>. By bringing his people out of Egypt, their ownership had passed to him from the Egyptians, just as if he had bought them.

It is a holy song, to the honour of God, to exalt his name, and celebrate his praise, and his only, not in the least to magnify any man. Holiness to the Lord is in every part of it. It may be considered as typical, and prophetical of the final destruction of the enemies of the church. Happy the people whose God is the Lord. They have work to do, temptations to grapple with, and afflictions to bear, and are weak in themselves; but his grace is their strength. They are often in sorrow, but in him they have comfort; he is their song. Sin, and death, and hell threaten them, but he is, and will be their salvation. The Lord is a God of almighty power, and woe to those that strive with their Maker! He is a God of matchless perfection; he is glorious in holiness; his holiness is his glory. His holiness appears in the hatred of sin, and his wrath against obstinate sinners. It appears in the deliverance of Israel, and his faithfulness to his own promise. He is fearful in praises; that which is matter of praise to the servants of God, is very dreadful to his enemies. He is doing wonders, things out of the common course of nature; wondrous to those in whose favour they are wrought, who are so unworthy, that they had no reason to expect them. There were wonders of power and wonders of grace; in both, God was to be humbly adored.</body></html>
