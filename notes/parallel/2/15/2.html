but its existence in the current speech has already been indicated by the name Moriah, which occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-1.htm" title="And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said to him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.">Genesis 22:1</a>. It is here used on account of the rhythm.<p><span class= "bld">He is become my salvation.</span>--Heb,, <span class= "ital">he has been to me for salvation: i.e., </span>"he has saved me out of the hand of Pharaoh." The beauty and force of the passage causes Isaiah to adopt it into one of his most glorious poems, the "joyful thanksgiving of the faithful for the mercies of God," contained in his twelfth chapter. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-2.htm" title="The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him.">Exodus 15:2</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">I will prepare him an habitation.</span>--So Onkelos and Aben-Ezra; but Jarchi, the Targums of Jerusalem and Jonathan, the LXX., and Vulg., with most moderns, translate, "I will glorify him." It is a strong objection to the rendering of the Authorised Version that Moses is not likely to have had the idea of preparing God a habitation until the revelation of God's will on the subject was made to him on Sinai (Exodus 25-27). The law of parallelism also requires such a meaning as "glorify" to correspond with the "exalt" of the next clause.<p><span class= "bld">My father's God.</span>--"Father" here, by a common Hebrew idiom, stands for "forefathers" generally. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-6.htm" title="Moreover he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look on God.">Exodus 3:6</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is my strength and song</span>. Literally, "My strength and song is Jah." The name <span class="accented">Jah</span> had not previously been used. It is commonly regarded as an abbreviated form of Jehovah, and was the form generally used in the termination of names, as Abijah, Ahaziah, Hezekiah, Zedekiah, Mount Moriah, etc. It takes the place of "Jehovah" here, probably on account of the rhythm. <span class="cmt_word">He is become my salvation</span>. Literally, "He has been to me for salvation," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "He has delivered me out of the hand of Pharaoh and his host, and so saved me from destruction." <span class="cmt_word">I will prepare him a habitation</span>. This translation seems to have come originally from the Targum of Onkelos, who paraphrases the single word of the text by the phrase "I will build him a sanctuary." The meaning is a possible one: but most modern commentators prefer to connect the verb used with a root meaning "beautiful," and translate "I will glorify him." (So Gesenius. Rosenmuller, Knobel, Kalisch, Cook. The LXX have <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">glorificabo</span>. The Syrian and Coptic versions agree, as do also the Targums of Jonathan and of Jerusalem.) <span class="cmt_word">The God of my father</span>. See the comment on Exodus 3:6. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-21 This song is the most ancient we know of. It is a holy song, to the honour of God, to exalt his name, and celebrate his praise, and his only, not in the least to magnify any man. Holiness to the Lord is in every part of it. It may be considered as typical, and prophetical of the final destruction of the enemies of the church. Happy the people whose God is the Lord. They have work to do, temptations to grapple with, and afflictions to bear, and are weak in themselves; but his grace is their strength. They are often in sorrow, but in him they have comfort; he is their song. Sin, and death, and hell threaten them, but he is, and will be their salvation. The Lord is a God of almighty power, and woe to those that strive with their Maker! He is a God of matchless perfection; he is glorious in holiness; his holiness is his glory. His holiness appears in the hatred of sin, and his wrath against obstinate sinners. It appears in the deliverance of Israel, and his faithfulness to his own promise. He is fearful in praises; that which is matter of praise to the servants of God, is very dreadful to his enemies. He is doing wonders, things out of the common course of nature; wondrous to those in whose favour they are wrought, who are so unworthy, that they had no reason to expect them. There were wonders of power and wonders of grace; in both, God was to be humbly adored.</body></html>
