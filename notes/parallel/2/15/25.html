but none of them is at present found in the Sinaitic peninsula, and the Arabs are not now acquainted with any means of rendering the bitter waters of Howarah and the neighbouring springs palatable. Perhaps in ancient times there were forms of vegetable life in the peninsula which do not now exist there. Moses would scarcely have been "shown a tree" unless the tree had some virtue of its own; but, on the other hand, the tree alone is scarcely to be credited with the entire effect. As in so many other instances, God seems to have made use of nature, as far as nature could go, and then to have superadded His own omnipotent energy in order to produce the required effect. (Compare our blessed Lord's method in working His miracles.)<p><span class= "bld">He made for them a statute and an ordinance.- </span>God took advantage of the occasion to draw a lesson from it. He promised that, as He had healed the waters, so, if the Israelites would henceforth faithfully keep His commandments, He would "heal" <span class= "ital">them </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-26.htm" title="And said, If you will diligently listen to the voice of the LORD your God, and will do that which is right in his sight, and will give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases on you, which I have brought on the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that heals you.">Exodus 15:26</a>), keeping them free from all the diseases of Egypt, and from the far greater evil involved in their own corrupted nature and infirmity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord shewed him a tree.</span> - Several trees or plants belonging to different parts of the world, are said to possess the quality of rendering bitter water sweet and agreeable; as the <span class="accented">nellimaram</span> of Coromandel, the <span class="accented">sassafras</span> of Florida, the <span class="accented">yerva Caniani</span> of Peru, and the <span class="accented">perru nelli</span> (Phylanthus emblica) of India. But none of them is found in the Sinaitic. peninsula. Burckhardt suggested (<span class="accented">Travels in Syria</span>. p. 474) that the berries of the <span class="accented">ghurkud</span> (Peganum retusum), a low thorny shrub which grows abundantly round the Ain Howarah, may have been used by Moses to sweeten the drink; but there are three objections to this. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Moses is not said to have used the berries, but the entire plant; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The berries would not have been procurable in April, since they do not ripen till June; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> They would not have produced any such effect on the water as Burckhardt imagined. In fact there is no tree or shrub now growing in the Sinaitic peninsula, which would have any sensible effect on such water as that of Ain Howarah; and the Bedouins of the neighbourhood know of no means by which it can be made drinkable. Many of the Fathers believed that the "tree" had no natural effect, and was commanded to be thrown in merely to symbolise the purifying power of the Cross of Christ. But to moderns such a view appears to savour of mysticism. It is perhaps most probable that there was some tree or shrub in the vicinity of the bitter fountain in Moses' time which had a natural purifying and sweetening power, but that it has now become extinct. If this be the case, the miracle consisted in God's pointing out the tree to Moses, who had no previous knowledge of it<span class="cmt_word">. The waters were made sweet</span>. Compare the miracle of Elisha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-19.htm">2 Kings 2:19-22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">There he made for them a statute and an ordinance</span>. See the next verse. God, it appears, after healing the water, and satisfying the physical thirst of his people, gave them an ordinance, which he connected by a promise with the miracle. If they would henceforth render strict obedience to all his commandments, then he would "heal" them as he had healed the water, would keep them free at once from physical and from moral evil, from the diseases of Egypt, and the diseases of their own hearts. <span class="cmt_word">And there he proved them</span>. From the moment of their quitting Egypt to that of their entering Canaan, God was ever "proving" his people - trying them, that is - exercising their faith, and patience and obedience and power of self-denial, in order to fit them for the position which they were to occupy in Canaan. He had proved them at the Red Sea, when he let them be shut in between the water and the host of the Egyptians - he proved them now at Marah by a bitter disappointment - he proved them again at Meribah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>); at Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-20.htm">Exodus 20:20</a>); at Taberah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-1.htm">Numbers 11:1-3</a>); at Kibroth-hattaavah (<span class="accented">ib</span>, verse 34); at Kadesh (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 13:26-33), and elsewhere. For forty years he led them through the wilderness" to prove them, to know what was in their heart" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8.htm">Deuteronomy 8</a>.), to fit them for their glorious and conquering career in the land of promise <span class="cmt_word">All these diseases</span>. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-15.htm">Deuteronomy 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27</a>. Kalisch correctly observes that, though the Egyptians had the character in antiquity of being among the healthiest and most robust of nations (Herod. 2:77), yet a certain small number of diseases have always raged among them with extreme severity He understands the present passage of the plagues, which, however, are certainly nowhere else called "diseases." There is no reason why the word should not be taken literally, as all take it in the passages of Deuteronomy above cited. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:22-27 In the wilderness of Shur the Israelites had no water. At Marah they had water, but it was bitter; so that they could not drink it. God can make bitter to us that from which we promise ourselves most, and often does so in the wilderness of this world, that our wants, and disappointments in the creature, may drive us to the Creator, in whose favour alone true comfort is to be had. In this distress the people fretted, and quarrelled with Moses. Hypocrites may show high affections, and appear earnest in religious exercises, but in the time of temptation they fall away. Even true believers, in seasons of sharp trial, will be tempted to fret, distrust, and murmur. But in every trial we should cast our care upon the Lord, and pour out our hearts before him. We shall then find that a submissive will, a peaceful conscience, and the comforts of the Holy Ghost, will render the bitterest trial tolerable, yea, pleasant. Moses did what the people had neglected to do; he cried unto the Lord. And God provided graciously for them. He directed Moses to a tree which he cast into the waters, when, at once, they were made sweet. Some make this tree typical of the cross of Christ, which sweetens the bitter waters of affliction to all the faithful, and enables them to rejoice in tribulation. But a rebellious Israelite shall fare no better than a rebellious Egyptian. The threatening is implied only, the promise is expressed. God is the great Physician. If we are kept well, it is he that keeps us; if we are made well, it is he that recovers us. He is our life and the length of our days. Let us not forget that we are kept from destruction, and delivered from our enemies, to be the Lord's servants. At Elim they had good water, and enough of it. Though God may, for a time, order his people to encamp by the bitter waters of Marah, that shall not always be their lot. Let us not faint at tribulations.</body></html>
