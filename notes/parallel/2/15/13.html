The poet's eye fixes itself upon the future. First, he speaks of the guidance of God, lately begun, and about to continue until Canaan is reached (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-13.htm" title="You in your mercy have led forth the people which you have redeemed: you have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation.">Exodus 15:13</a>). Then his glance turns to the enemies of Israel, and he considers. The effect which the miraculous deliverance of Israel from Egypt will have upon them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/15-14.htm" title="The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.">Exodus 15:14-16</a>). Finally, he sees the people brought into the "land of their inheritance," and securely established there under the ordering of Divine Providence. Then, with an ascription of glory which may be compared with the Doxology attached to the Lord's Prayer in St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-13.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a charge to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.">Exodus 6:13</a>), and to that attached in the Liturgies of the Church to the Psalms and Canticles, he terminates his composition.<p>(13) <span class= "bld">Hast led forth . . . hast guided.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">leadest forth </span>. . . <span class= "ital">guidest. </span>The guidance was not over; rather, it was just begun. The want of a present tense in Hebrew causes the preterite and future to have, both of them, under certain circumstances, the force of the present.<p><span class= "bld">Thy holy habitation.</span>--It might be supposed that Canaan was the "habitation" intended; but the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-17.htm" title="You shall bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which you have made for you to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which your hands have established.">Exodus 15:17</a> imply something more. Moses certainly knew that when Canaan was reached God would select a place to "put His name there" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-5.htm" title="But to the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even to his habitation shall you seek, and thither you shall come:">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-11.htm" title="Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall you bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to the LORD:">Deuteronomy 12:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-14.htm" title="But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you.">Deuteronomy 12:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/14-23.htm" title="And you shall eat before the LORD your God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of your corn, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your herds and of your flocks; that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always.">Deuteronomy 14:23-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-6.htm" title="But at the place which the LORD your God shall choose to place his name in, there you shall sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that you came forth out of Egypt.">Deuteronomy 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-11.htm" title="And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD your God has chosen to place his name there.">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>, &c.), and possibly knew by revelation what place would be ultimately selected.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou in thy mercy hast led forth</span>.

Or "thou guidest." <span class="cmt_word">Thy holy habitation</span>. By "God's holy habitation" some understand Mount Sinai, others Canaan, others Mount Moriah, or even the temple there to be built ultimately. That Sinai is not intended seems clear from verses 14, 15, where the nations mentioned are such as were untouched by the occupation of that mountain. Canaan might sufficiently answer the requirements of the present verse, but scarcely comes up to those of verse 17. Altogether, it is clear that Moses knew there would be a place in the land of Canaan where God would "put his name" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5, 11, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-23.htm">Deuteronomy 14:23, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-6.htm">Deuteronomy 16:6, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-2.htm">Deuteronomy 26:2</a>; etc.); and it would seem to be not unlikely that he may have known where the place would be by special revelation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-21 This song is the most ancient we know of. It is a holy song, to the honour of God, to exalt his name, and celebrate his praise, and his only, not in the least to magnify any man. Holiness to the Lord is in every part of it. It may be considered as typical, and prophetical of the final destruction of the enemies of the church. Happy the people whose God is the Lord. They have work to do, temptations to grapple with, and afflictions to bear, and are weak in themselves; but his grace is their strength. They are often in sorrow, but in him they have comfort; he is their song. Sin, and death, and hell threaten them, but he is, and will be their salvation. The Lord is a God of almighty power, and woe to those that strive with their Maker! He is a God of matchless perfection; he is glorious in holiness; his holiness is his glory. His holiness appears in the hatred of sin, and his wrath against obstinate sinners. It appears in the deliverance of Israel, and his faithfulness to his own promise. He is fearful in praises; that which is matter of praise to the servants of God, is very dreadful to his enemies. He is doing wonders, things out of the common course of nature; wondrous to those in whose favour they are wrought, who are so unworthy, that they had no reason to expect them. There were wonders of power and wonders of grace; in both, God was to be humbly adored.</body></html>
