It concentrates into four words the gist of those two passages.<p>(11) <span class= "bld">Who is like unto thee . . . Among the gods </span>?--This is undoubtedly the true meaning. It had been a main object of the entire series of miraculous visitations to show that Jehovah was "exalted far above all other gods." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-5.htm" title="And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth my hand on Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.">Exodus 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-4.htm" title="And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honored on Pharaoh, and on all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.">Exodus 14:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-18.htm" title="And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honor on Pharaoh, on his chariots, and on his horsemen.">Exodus 14:18</a>.) Moses now emphasises the contrast by adducing three points on which Jehovah is unapproachable--holiness, awefulness, and miraculous power. God is (1) "glorious in holiness," exalted in this respect far, far above all other beings; (2) "fearful in praises"--the proper object of the profoundest awe, even to those who approach Him with praise and thanksgiving; and (3) one who "doeth wonders," who both through nature, and on occasions overruling nature, accomplishes the most astonishing results, causing all men to marvel at His Almighty power. The gods of the heathen were, in fact, either nonentities or evil spirits. So far as they were the former, they could come into no comparison at all with Jehovah; so far as they were the latter, they fell infinitely short of Him in every respect. Of holiness they possessed no remnant; in awfulness they were immeasurably inferior; in the ability to work wonders they did not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. "Among the gods," as the Psalmist says, "there is none like unto thee, O Lord; there is none that can do as thou doest" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-8.htm" title="Among the gods there is none like to you, O Lord; neither are there any works like to your works.">Psalm 86:8</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12</span> contain the third stanza of the first division of the ode. It is short compared to the other two, containing merely a fresh ascription of praise to God, cast in anew form; and a repetition of the great fact which the poem commemorates - the Egyptian overthrow. We conceive that Miriam's chorus (ver. 21) was again interposed between verses 10 and 11. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods?</span> It was one great object of the whole series of miraculous visitations whereof Egypt had been the scene, that the true God, Jehovah, should be exalted far above all the gods of the heathen. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-5.htm">Exodus 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-4.htm">Exodus 14:4, 18</a>.) Moses therefore makes this one of his topics of praise; and at the same time notes three points in which God has no rival - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Holiness; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Awfulness; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Miraculous power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-8.htm">Psalm 86:8</a>; "Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like thy works." <span class="cmt_word">Fearful in praises</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "to be viewed with awe even when we praise Him." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-21 This song is the most ancient we know of. It is a holy song, to the honour of God, to exalt his name, and celebrate his praise, and his only, not in the least to magnify any man. Holiness to the Lord is in every part of it. It may be considered as typical, and prophetical of the final destruction of the enemies of the church. Happy the people whose God is the Lord. They have work to do, temptations to grapple with, and afflictions to bear, and are weak in themselves; but his grace is their strength. They are often in sorrow, but in him they have comfort; he is their song. Sin, and death, and hell threaten them, but he is, and will be their salvation. The Lord is a God of almighty power, and woe to those that strive with their Maker! He is a God of matchless perfection; he is glorious in holiness; his holiness is his glory. His holiness appears in the hatred of sin, and his wrath against obstinate sinners. It appears in the deliverance of Israel, and his faithfulness to his own promise. He is fearful in praises; that which is matter of praise to the servants of God, is very dreadful to his enemies. He is doing wonders, things out of the common course of nature; wondrous to those in whose favour they are wrought, who are so unworthy, that they had no reason to expect them. There were wonders of power and wonders of grace; in both, God was to be humbly adored.</body></html>
