It begins, like the first, with some general expressions, setting forth the glory and power of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/15-6.htm" title="Your right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: your right hand, O LORD, has dashed in pieces the enemy.">Exodus 15:6-7</a>), as shown in the recent catastrophe. From this it proceeds to the catastrophe itself, which it describes in considerable detail, noting (1) the sudden rise of the wind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-8.htm" title="And with the blast of your nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.">Exodus 15:8</a>); (2) the gathering together of the waters into separate masses (<span class= "ital">ibid</span>.); (3) the boastful and vindictive temper of the Egyptians (<span class= "ital">ibid.</span>); (4) the rise of a second wind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-9.htm" title="The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied on them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.">Exodus 15:9</a>); (5) the consequent return of the waters; and (6) the submerging of the host by them. The second stanza is considerably longer than the first, consisting of twelve, whereas the first consists of only seven, lines.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">Thy right hand.</span>--Here is a second anthropomorphism, following naturally on the first, and occuring in the later Scriptures frequently, though now used for the first time.<p><span class= "bld">Hath dashed in pieces.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">dashes in pieces. </span>The verb is in the future, but is a future of continuance.<p><span class= "bld">Thou hast overthrown . . . --</span>Heb., <span class= "ital">thou overthrowest them that rise up against thee; thou sendest forth thy wrath: it consumeth them like stubble.</span><p><span class= "bld">The blast of thy nostrils.</span>--The "east wind" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-21.htm" title="And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.">Exodus 14:21</a>. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-15.htm" title="Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.">Psalm 18:15</a>.) As a physical effect, the gathering together of the waters, is ascribed to the "blast," we must understand a physical cause. Otherwise, God's wrath might be meant, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-9.htm" title="By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.">Job 4:9</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed.</span>--The literalism which, taking its stand on these phrases, maintains that the water "gave up its nature (Kalisch) indicates an inability to distinguish poetry from prose, and fact from imagery. As well might it be held that the east wind was actually the breath of God's nostrils. (See the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-22.htm" title="And the children of Israel went into the middle of the sea on the dry ground: and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.">Exodus 14:22</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-18.</span> - Between verses 5 and 6, Miriam's chorus was probably interposed "Sing ye unto the Lord," etc. Then began the second strophe or stanza of the ode. It is, in the main, expansive and exegetical of the preceding stanza, going into greater detail, and drawing a contrast between the antecedent pride and arrogance of the Egyptians and their subsequent miserable fall. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy right hand, O Lord</span>. Another anthropomorphism, here used for the first time. Compare ver. 12; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; and the Psalms, passim. <span class="cmt_word">Is become glorious</span> Or "is glorious. Kalisch rightly regards verses 6 and 7 as containing "a general description of God's omnipotence and justice," and notes that the poet only returns to the subject of the Egyptians in verse 8. So also Knobel. <span class="cmt_word">Hath dashed in pieces</span>. Rather, "Will dash in pieces," or "dashes in pieces" - a general statement. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-21 This song is the most ancient we know of. It is a holy song, to the honour of God, to exalt his name, and celebrate his praise, and his only, not in the least to magnify any man. Holiness to the Lord is in every part of it. It may be considered as typical, and prophetical of the final destruction of the enemies of the church. Happy the people whose God is the Lord. They have work to do, temptations to grapple with, and afflictions to bear, and are weak in themselves; but his grace is their strength. They are often in sorrow, but in him they have comfort; he is their song. Sin, and death, and hell threaten them, but he is, and will be their salvation. The Lord is a God of almighty power, and woe to those that strive with their Maker! He is a God of matchless perfection; he is glorious in holiness; his holiness is his glory. His holiness appears in the hatred of sin, and his wrath against obstinate sinners. It appears in the deliverance of Israel, and his faithfulness to his own promise. He is fearful in praises; that which is matter of praise to the servants of God, is very dreadful to his enemies. He is doing wonders, things out of the common course of nature; wondrous to those in whose favour they are wrought, who are so unworthy, that they had no reason to expect them. There were wonders of power and wonders of grace; in both, God was to be humbly adored.</body></html>
