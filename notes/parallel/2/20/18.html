They felt the near contact with God to be more than they could bear. Even Moses was so deeply moved that he exclaimed, "I exceedingly fear and quake" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-21.htm" title="And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)">Hebrews 12:21</a>). The people were still more afraid, and felt compelled to withdraw to a distance, beyond the sound of the terrible voice. From Deuteronomy we learn that they retired within their tents (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-30.htm" title="Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.">Deuteronomy 5:30</a>), having first sent a deputation to Moses, with a request that he would thenceforth act as their intermediary. It pleased God to assent to this proposal; and the remainder of the Law was communicated by God to Moses, and by Moses to the Israelites.<p>(18) <span class= "bld">And all the people saw the thunderings</span><p>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Perceived them.

The effect produced upon the people by the accumulated terrors of Sinai - "the thunderings and the lightnings, the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking" - the cloud, and the voice out of the cloud - was an awful and terrible fear. They could not bear the manifestation of the near presence of God; and therefore "they removed and stood afar off." It seemed to them as if, on hearing the voice of God, speaking out of the thick darkness, they must die (ver. 19). Moses, upon their expressing these feelings, comforted them with an assurance that God had shown his terrors, not for their injury, but to put his fear in their hearts (ver. 20), and allowed them to retire to a distance from the mount, while he himself "drew near unto the thick darkness where God was" (ver. 21). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people saw the thunderings</span>. The use of a specific verb for a generic one, with terms to all of which it is not, strictly speaking, applicable, is common to many writers, and is known to grammarians as zengma. "Saw" here means "perceived, witnessed." <span class="cmt_word">The mountain smoking</span>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-23.htm">Deuteronomy 5:23</a> it is said that "the mountain did burn with fire." <span class="cmt_word">When the people saw it, they removed</span>. It appears, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-23.htm">Deuteronomy 5:23</a>, that. before retiring, the people sent a deputation of heads of tribes and elders up to Moses in the mount, to convey to him their wishes, and suggest that he should be their intermediary with God. Moses laid their wishes before God, and was directed to give them his sanction, <span class="accented">whereupon they withdrew to their tents</span> (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 30). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:18-21 This law, which is so extensive that we cannot measure it, so spiritual that we cannot evade it, and so reasonable that we cannot find fault with it, will be the rule of the future judgment of God, as it is for the present conduct of man. If tried by this rule, we shall find our lives have been passed in transgressions. And with this holy law and an awful judgment before us, who can despise the gospel of Christ? And the knowledge of the law shows our need of repentance. In every believer's heart sin is dethroned and crucified, the law of God is written, and the image of God renewed. The Holy Spirit enables him to hate sin and flee from it, to love and keep this law in sincerity and truth; nor will he cease to repent.</body></html>
