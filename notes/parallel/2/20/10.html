Some exceptions were allowed, as the work of the Priests and Levites in the Temple on the Sabbath, attendance on and care of the sick, rescue of a beast that was in peril of its life, &c. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-5.htm" title="Or have you not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?">Matthew 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-11.htm" title="And he said to them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?">Matthew 12:11</a>.) But the tendency was to press the negative aspect to an extreme, and to ignore the positive one. By the time of the Maccabees it had come to be considered unlawful to defend oneself against the attack of an enemy on the Sabbath (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/2-32.htm" title="They pursued after them a great number, and having overtaken them, they camped against them, and made war against them on the sabbath day.">1 Maccabees 2:32-38</a> :<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/5-25.htm" title="Who coming to Jerusalem, and pretending peace, did forbear till the holy day of the sabbath, when taking the Jews keeping holy day, he commanded his men to arm themselves.">2 Maccabees 5:25-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/6-11.htm" title="And others, that had run together into caves near by, to keep the sabbath day secretly, being discovered by Philip, were all burnt together, because they made a conscience to help themselves for the honour of the most sacred day.">2 Maccabees 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/15-1.htm" title="But Nicanor, hearing that Judas and his company were in the strong places about Samaria, resolved without any danger to set upon them on the sabbath day.">2 Maccabees 15:1</a>); and, though this extravagant view did not maintain its ground, yet at the time of our Lord's ministry a rigour of observance was in vogue upon other points which exceeded the limits of reasonable exegesis. Our Lord's practice was pointedly directed against the overstrained theory of Sabbath observance which was current in His day, and was clearly intended to vindicate for His disciples a liberty which ecclesiastical authority was disposed to deny them. There are parts of Christendom in which, even at the present day, a similar spirit prevails, and a similar vindication is needed.<p><span class= "bld">Nor thy son, nor thy daughter.</span>--The whole family was to partake in the Sabbatical rest. Labour was to cease, not to be devolved by the stronger on weaker members.<p><span class= "bld">Thy manservant, nor thy maidservant.</span>--The rest was to extend also to the domestics, who specially required it, since the heavier labours of the household had to be performed by them.<p><span class= "bld">Thy cattle.</span>--Labour can scarcely be exacted from cattle without man being also called upon to work. God, however, "careth for cattle," even for their own sakes, and wills that the Sabbath rest be extended to them. "His mercy is over all His works," and embraces the dumb unreasoning animals no less than His human creatures. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-1.htm" title="And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged;">Genesis 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/9-9.htm" title="And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;">Genesis 9:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-19.htm" title="Send therefore now, and gather your cattle, and all that you have in the field; for on every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down on them, and they shall die.">Exodus 9:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-4.htm" title="You shall not muzzle the ox when he treads out the corn.">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-11.htm" title="And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more then six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?">Jonah 4:11</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God</span>. Rather - "The seventh day shall be a sabbath to the Lord thy God;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the seventh day shall be a day of holy rest dedicated to religion. All unnecessary labour shall be suspended and put aside - the law of rest and ease, so far as bodily toil is concerned, which was the law of man's existence before the fall, shall supersede for the time that law of heavy toil and continual unrest, which was laid on man as the penalty of his transgression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>). Eden shall be, as it were<span class="cmt_word">,</span> restored - man shall not "go out to his toil and his labour" - even the very beasts, pressed into man's service since the fall, shall rest. <span class="cmt_word">In it thou shalt not do any work</span>. On the exceptions to this rule, which even Judaism, with its extreme formality and literalism, saw to be necessary, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-5.htm">Matthew 12:5, 11</a>. Still in many respects, a superstitious adherence to the precept was maintained by religious Jews, who would not even defend themselves on the sabbath, if attacked by an enemy (1 Mac. 2:32-38; 2 Mac. 5:25, 26 2Mac. 6:11 2Mac. 15:1). Experience, however, taught them that the law had not been intended to extend so far, and after a time they determined, not to seek battle, but to accept if, and do their best, on the sabbath day (1 Mac. 2:41). <span class="cmt_word">Thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter</span>. The rest is to extend to the whole family. Work is not to be merely devolved by the parents upon the children. <span class="cmt_word">Thy manservant, nor thy maid servant</span>. It is to extend beyond the family proper, to the domestics of the household, who are to enjoy the respite from toil and to have the advantage of the religious refreshment, no less than their masters. <span class="cmt_word">Nor thy cattle</span>. God's care for cattle is a remarkable feature of the Old Testament dispensation. God, at the time of the flood, "remembered <span class="accented">Noah and the cattle which were with him in the ark"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-1.htm">Genesis 8:1</a>). Soon after, his covenant, not to drown the earth any more, was established "with the fowl, and with the cattle, and with every beast of the earth," no less than with man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-9.htm">Genesis 9:9-11</a>). In the Psalms he de clares that "the cattle upon a thousand hills" are <span class="accented">his</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-10.htm">Psalm 50:10</a>). In Jonah, we find that Nineveh was spared, in part because there was in it "much cattle" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>). The precept, "Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn" is characteristic of the Mosaic dispensation, and had no parallel in the written codes or in the actual customs of other ancient nations. Animal suffering was generally regarded as of small account in the ancient world; and the idea of protecting animals from ill usage was wholly unknown. On the contrary, as Dr. Dollinger well observes (<span class="accented">Jew and Gentile</span>, vol. 2. pp. 346-7): "The law was specially careful about the welfare of animals; they were to be treated with compassion and kindness. Domestic animals were to be well fed, and to enjoy the rest of the sabbath. The Israelites were to help to lift up the ass which had fallen beneath its burden, and to bring back the beast that had gone astray (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-5.htm">Exodus 23:5, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>)... The young was not to be taken from its mother before the seventh day... From these and similar ordinances - such, for instance, as about the least painful method of killing animals - it is plain that the law tried to subdue that coarse turn of mind and unfeeling cruelty, which are engendered by the maltreatment of animals." <span class="cmt_word">Nor the stranger that is within thy gates</span>. The "strangers within the gates" of Israel are those foreigners who voluntarily sojourned with them in their camps or (afterwards) in their towns. A "mixed multitude" had gone up out of Egypt with them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>), and accompanied them in their wilderness wanderings. The command that these too should rest, was at once a restriction upon their liberty, requiring them to conform to the habits of those among whom they dwelt, and an admission of them into participation in some portion of the privileges of Israel. The sacred rest of the sabbath prefigured the final peace and happiness of the blest in heaven; and they who were commanded to share in the first, were encouraged to hope that they might also participate in the second. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:3-11 The first four of the ten commandments, commonly called the FIRST table, tell our duty to God. It was fit that those should be put first, because man had a Maker to love, before he had a neighbour to love. It cannot be expected that he should be true to his brother, who is false to his God. The first commandment concerns the object of worship, JEHOVAH, and him only. The worship of creatures is here forbidden. Whatever comes short of perfect love, gratitude, reverence, or worship, breaks this commandment. Whatsoever ye do, do all the glory of God. The second commandment refers to the worship we are to render to the Lord our God. It is forbidden to make any image or picture of the Deity, in any form, or for any purpose; or to worship any creature, image, or picture. But the spiritual import of this command extends much further. All kinds of superstition are here forbidden, and the using of mere human inventions in the worship of God. The third commandment concerns the manner of worship, that it be with all possible reverence and seriousness. All false oaths are forbidden. All light appealing to God, all profane cursing, is a horrid breach of this command. It matters not whether the word of God, or sacred things, all such-like things break this commandment, and there is no profit, honour, or pleasure in them. The Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. The form of the fourth commandment, Remember, shows that it was not now first given, but was known by the people before. One day in seven is to be kept holy. Six days are allotted to worldly business, but not so as to neglect the service of God, and the care of our souls. On those days we must do all our work, and leave none to be done on the sabbath day. Christ allowed works of necessity, charity, and piety; for the sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath, Mr 2:27; but all works of luxury, vanity, or self-indulgence in any form, are forbidden. Trading, paying wages, settling accounts, writing letters of business, worldly studies, trifling visits, journeys, or light conversation, are not keeping this day holy to the Lord. Sloth and indolence may be a carnal, but not a holy rest. The sabbath of the Lord should be a day of rest from worldly labour, and a rest in the service of God. The advantages from the due keeping of this holy day, were it only to the health and happiness of mankind, with the time it affords for taking care of the soul, show the excellency of this commandment. The day is blessed; men are blessed by it, and in it. The blessing and direction to keep holy are not limited to the seventh day, but are spoken of the sabbath day.</body></html>
