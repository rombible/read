But we cannot, therefore, conclude that the Sabbath was a primitive institution, which the Israelites were bound to have held in perpetual remembrance, since the reference may be merely to the injunction recently given in connection with the gathering of the manna. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-23.htm" title="And he said to them, This is that which the LORD has said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath to the LORD: bake that which you will bake to day, and seethe that you will seethe; and that which remains over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.">Exodus 16:23</a>). The Sabbath had certainly been at that time solemnly instituted, if no earlier. (See Note on. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-25.htm" title="And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath to the LORD: to day you shall not find it in the field.">Exodus 16:25</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">To keep it holy.</span>--It had been already noted that the rest of the Sabbath was to be a "holy rest" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-23.htm" title="And he said to them, This is that which the LORD has said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath to the LORD: bake that which you will bake to day, and seethe that you will seethe; and that which remains over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.">Exodus 16:23</a>); but it is not quite clear what was intended by this. For the most part, the Law insists on abstinence from labour as the main element of Sabbath observance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/16-23.htm" title="And he said to them, This is that which the LORD has said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath to the LORD: bake that which you will bake to day, and seethe that you will seethe; and that which remains over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.">Exodus 16:23-30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/20-9.htm" title="Six days shall you labor, and do all your work:">Exodus 20:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-12.htm" title="Six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you shall rest: that your ox and your ass may rest, and the son of your handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.">Exodus 23:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-21.htm" title="Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest: in ripening time and in harvest you shall rest.">Exodus 34:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/35-2.htm" title="Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whoever does work therein shall be put to death.">Exodus 35:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/5-12.htm" title="Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD your God has commanded you.">Deuteronomy 5:12-15</a>, &c.); and it can scarcely be said to prescribe anything positive with respect to the religious employment of the day. That the morning and evening sacrifice were to be doubled might indeed suggest to a religiously-minded Israelite that his�own religious exercises and devotions should also be augmented; but the Law made no such requirement. His attendance at the morning and evening sacrifice was not required nor expected. No provision was made for his receiving religious teaching on the day; no special offerings were required from him upon it. The day became one of "languid bodily ease, relaxation, and luxury" to the bulk of the later Jews (Augustin. <span class= "ital">Enarr. in Psalms 91</span>); but probably there were always some whom natural piety taught that, in the absence of their ordinary employments, it was intended they should devote themselves to prayer and communion with God--to meditation on "high and holy themes," such as His mercies in past time, His character, attributes, revelations of Himself, government of the world, dealings with men and nations. Thus only could the day be really "kept holy," with a positive, and not a mere negative, holiness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remember the sabbath day.</span> The institution of the sabbath dates, at any rate, from the giving of the manna (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-23.htm">Exodus 16:23</a>). Its primeval institution, which has been thought to be implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a>, is uncertain. The word "remember" here may be simply a reference to what passed in the "wilderness of Sin" as related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-22.htm">Exodus 16:22-30</a>. On the sabbath itself, both Jewish and Christian, see the comment upon that chapter. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:3-11 The first four of the ten commandments, commonly called the FIRST table, tell our duty to God. It was fit that those should be put first, because man had a Maker to love, before he had a neighbour to love. It cannot be expected that he should be true to his brother, who is false to his God. The first commandment concerns the object of worship, JEHOVAH, and him only. The worship of creatures is here forbidden. Whatever comes short of perfect love, gratitude, reverence, or worship, breaks this commandment. Whatsoever ye do, do all the glory of God. The second commandment refers to the worship we are to render to the Lord our God. It is forbidden to make any image or picture of the Deity, in any form, or for any purpose; or to worship any creature, image, or picture. But the spiritual import of this command extends much further. All kinds of superstition are here forbidden, and the using of mere human inventions in the worship of God. The third commandment concerns the manner of worship, that it be with all possible reverence and seriousness. All false oaths are forbidden. All light appealing to God, all profane cursing, is a horrid breach of this command. It matters not whether the word of God, or sacred things, all such-like things break this commandment, and there is no profit, honour, or pleasure in them. The Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. The form of the fourth commandment, Remember, shows that it was not now first given, but was known by the people before. One day in seven is to be kept holy. Six days are allotted to worldly business, but not so as to neglect the service of God, and the care of our souls. On those days we must do all our work, and leave none to be done on the sabbath day. Christ allowed works of necessity, charity, and piety; for the sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath, Mr 2:27; but all works of luxury, vanity, or self-indulgence in any form, are forbidden. Trading, paying wages, settling accounts, writing letters of business, worldly studies, trifling visits, journeys, or light conversation, are not keeping this day holy to the Lord. Sloth and indolence may be a carnal, but not a holy rest. The sabbath of the Lord should be a day of rest from worldly labour, and a rest in the service of God. The advantages from the due keeping of this holy day, were it only to the health and happiness of mankind, with the time it affords for taking care of the soul, show the excellency of this commandment. The day is blessed; men are blessed by it, and in it. The blessing and direction to keep holy are not limited to the seventh day, but are spoken of the sabbath day.</body></html>
