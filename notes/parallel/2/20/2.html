The ten precepts were prefaced by this distinct announcement of who it was that uttered them. God would have the Israelites clearly understand, that he himself gave them the commandments. It is only possible to reconcile the declarations of the New Testament, that the law was given by the ministration of angels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>) with this and other plain statements, by regarding God the Son as the actual speaker.

God does not appeal to his authority as creator, but to his mercy and kindness as protector and deliverer.

This law God had given to man before; it was written in his heart; but sin so defaced it, that it was necessary to revive the knowledge of it. The law is spiritual, and takes knowledge of the secret thoughts, desires, and dispositions of the heart. Its grand demand is love, without which outward obedience is mere hypocrisy. It requires perfect, unfailing, constant obedience; no law in the world admits disobedience to itself. Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all, Jas 2:10. Whether in the heart or the conduct, in thought, word, or deed, to omit or to vary any thing, is sin, and the wages of sin is death.</body></html>
