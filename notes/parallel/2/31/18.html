that you may teach them.">Exodus 24:12</a>), and which were pre-supposed in the entire arrangement of the sanctuary. The Court pre-supposed the tabernacle; the outer chamber of the tabernacle, or holy place, was a mere vestibule to the inner chamber, or holy of holies: the inner chamber was a receptacle for the ark; and the ark was a chest or coffer constructed to contain the Two Tables. The entire design having been laid down, it was a first step towards the carrying out of the design to put into the hands of Moses that treasure with a view to which all the directions concerning the tabernacle had been given.<p><span class= "bld">Two tables of testimony.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the two tables. </span>The treasure which had been glanced at in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-21.htm" title="And you shall put the mercy seat above on the ark; and in the ark you shall put the testimony that I shall give you.">Exodus 25:21</a>, and distinctly promised in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-12.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give you tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that you may teach them.">Exodus 24:12</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Written with the finger of God.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-12.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give you tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that you may teach them.">Exodus 24:12</a>, where God speaks of "commandments which <span class= "ital">He </span>has written." We must understand that the tables were inscribed by some supernatural process, and not by any human hand. The exact nature of the supernatural process is not revealed to us.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - THE TABLES OF TESTIMONY. It had been assumed, in the directions given for the construction of the ark, that God would give, in some material form, a document to be called "the testimony," which was to be laid up inside it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>). It is not too much to say that the tabernacle, with its various appurtenances, was constructed for this purpose; the rest of the tabernacle was designed with a view to the holy of holies the holy of holies was designed as a receptacle for the ark - and the ark was designed as a receptacle for the tables of testimony. This section could, therefore, scarcely be concluded without some definite account of the document which was to give the ark and the tabernacle itself, its main significance. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he had made an end of communing</span>. Literally, "when he had finished speaking." <span class="cmt_word">Two tables</span>. Rather, "<span class="accented">the</span> two tables" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, <span class="accented">the</span> tables promised when he went up into the mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of stone</span>. Stone was the ordinary material on which Egyptian documents were engraved, both at the time of the Exodus, and before and after. They were, however, for the most part, either inscribed upon the natural rock, or engraved on the walls of temples or tombs. Inscriptions upon slabs of stone are rare, more especially in the early times, and would scarcely have occurred to Moses himself. <span class="cmt_word">Written with the finger of God</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "inscribed supernaturally" - not cut by any human hand. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-16.htm">Exodus 32:16</a>. It is idle to speculate on the exact mode of the Divine operation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:18 The law was written in tables of stone, to show how lasting it is: to denote likewise the hardness of our hearts; one might more easily write on stone, than write any thing good on our corrupt natural hearts. It was written with the finger of God; by his will and power. God only can write his law in the heart: he gives a heart of flesh; then, by his Spirit, which is the finger of God, writes his will in the heart, 2Co 3:3.</body></html>
