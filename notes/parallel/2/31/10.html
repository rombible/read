but the Rabbinical interpreters understand the cloths in which the ark and other vessels of the sanctuary were wrapped when the camp was moved from place to place (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/4-6.htm" title="And shall put thereon the covering of badgers' skins, and shall spread over it a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in the staves thereof.">Numbers 4:6-13</a>). These, like the cloths here spoken of (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-1.htm" title="And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.">Exodus 39:1</a>), were to be of blue, and purple, and scarlet; and it would be natural to distinguish them from the "holy garments," as is done both here and also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-19.htm" title="The cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.">Exodus 35:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-1.htm" title="And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.">Exodus 39:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-41.htm" title="The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office.">Exodus 39:41</a>. They had, however, not been previously mentioned in the directions. Perhaps the true explanation is, that under the words "cloths of service" (<span class= "ital">bigdey s?rad, </span>or <span class= "ital">bigdeh hass?rad</span>) are included both the garments of Aaron and also those of his sons, the two later clauses of the verse being exegetical of the first clause. In that case, we should translate: <span class= "ital">The robes of service, both the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and also the garments of his sons. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-41.htm" title="The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office.">Exodus 39:41</a></span> is decidedly favourable to this interpretation.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> <span class="cmt_word">The cloths of service</span>.

The honour which comes from God, is always attended with a work to be done; to be employed for God is high honour. Those whom God calls to any service, he will find or make fit for it. The Lord gives different gifts to different persons; let each mind his proper work, diligently remembering that whatever wisdom any one possesses, the Lord put it in the heart, to do his commandments.</body></html>
