but its adoption by many of the heathen nations had rendered it no longer a distinguishing mark by which God's people could be certainly known from others. Thus a new "sign" was needed. The observance of one day in seven as a day of holy rest became henceforth the distinguishing sign, and proved effectual. It was not likely to be adopted, and in point of fact was not adopted, by any of the heathen. We find it in the latest time of the Jewish nation still regarded as the special mark and badge of a Jew (Juv. <span class= "ital">Sat. vi.</span> 159, 14:96; Mart. <span class= "ital">Epig. 4:4</span>, 50:7, &c.).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Verily</span>. Rosenmuller suggests, "Nevertheless." But there is no need for any change. <span class="cmt_word">It is a sign</span>. Hitherto circumcision had been the only visible "sign" that the Israelites were under a special covenant with God - his people, bound to him by special ties (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-9.htm">Genesis 17:9-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-8.htm">Acts 7:8</a>). The adoption of circumcision by the Egyptians and other nations (Herod. 2:104) had produced the effect that this "sign" was no longer distinguishing. It might be still" a sign of profession "; but it had ceased to be "a mark of difference "; and some other mark was therefore needed. Such the observance of the sabbath by entire abstinence from servile work became. No other nation adopted it. It continued to Roman times the mark and badge of a Jew.(<span class="accented">Juv</span>. <span class="accented">Sat</span>. 6:159; 14:96). <span class="cmt_word">That ye may know</span>, etc. By keeping the sabbath day as a day of holy rest the Israelites would know - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, would realise severally in their own per sons, that God was their sanctifier. Sanctification would be the fruit of their obedience. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:12-17 Orders were now given that a tabernacle should be set up for the service of God. But they must not think that the nature of the work, and the haste that was required, would justify them in working at it on sabbath days. The Hebrew word /shabath/ signifies rest, or ceasing from labour. The thing signified by the sabbath is that rest in glory which remains for the people of God; therefore the moral obligation of the sabbath must continue, till time is swallowed up in eternity.</body></html>
