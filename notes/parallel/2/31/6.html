Our version, indeed, styles the latter "an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-23.htm" title="And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.">Exodus 38:23</a>), from which it might be supposed that, like Bezaleel, he cultivated various branches of art. In the original, however, nothing is said of engraving, and the true meaning seems to be that Aholiab had the charge of the textile fabrics needed for the sanctuary, and directed both the weaving and the embroidery, but did not intermeddle in other matters. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-23.htm" title="And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.">Exodus 38:23</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Of the tribe of Dan.</span>--The tribe of Dan is among the most undistinguished; but it produced two great artists--Aholiab, the skilful maker of the textile fabrics of the tabernacle, and Hiram, the master workman employed in the ornamentation of Solomon's temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-14.htm" title="The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of engraving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with your cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David your father.">2Chronicles 2:14</a>).<p><span class= "bld">All that are wise hearted.</span>--On the expression "wise hearted," see Note 1 on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-3.htm" title="And you shall speak to all that are wise hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister to me in the priest's office.">Exodus 28:3</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Aholiab</span> appears to have had the entire charge of the textile fabrics, both woven and embroidered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-23.htm">Exodus 38:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of the tribe of Ban</span>. It is remarkable that Hiram, the chief artist employed by Solomon for the ornamental work of the temple, was also a descendant of Dan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-14.htm">2 Chronicles 2:14</a>). Yet the Danites were in general rather warlike and rude than artistic (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-17.htm">Genesis 49:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-22.htm">Deuteronomy 33:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-2.htm">Judges 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-11.htm">Judges 18:11, 27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the hearts of all that are wise hearted have I put wisdom</span>. "Unto him that hath shall be given. Those who were already "wise hearted - possessed, that is, of artistic power - were selected by God to receive extraordinary gifts of the same kind. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:1-11 The Israelites, who had been masons and bricklayers in Egypt, were not qualified for curious workmanship; but the Spirit who gave the apostles utterance in divers tongues, miraculously gave Bezaleel and Aholiab the skill that was wanting. The honour which comes from God, is always attended with a work to be done; to be employed for God is high honour. Those whom God calls to any service, he will find or make fit for it. The Lord gives different gifts to different persons; let each mind his proper work, diligently remembering that whatever wisdom any one possesses, the Lord put it in the heart, to do his commandments.</body></html>
