The Sabbath-breaker now threw himself out of covenant with God, and not only so, but did what in him lay to throw the whole people out of covenant. His guilt was therefore great, and the assignment to it of the death-penalty is in no way surprising; rather, it is in accordance with the general spirit of the code (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/21-16.htm" title="And he that steals a man, and sells him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.">Exodus 21:16-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-29.htm" title="But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it has been testified to his owner, and he has not kept him in, but that he has killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.">Exodus 21:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/22-18.htm" title="You shall not suffer a witch to live.">Exodus 22:18-20</a>, &c.). When the occasion arose, there was no hesitation in carrying the law out (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/15-32.htm" title="And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks on the sabbath day.">Numbers 15:32-35</a>).<p>Cut off.--Or, <span class= "ital">separated, set apart from. </span>His act at once cast him out from the number of God's people, made him an outlaw, <span class= "ital">ipso facto </span>excommunicated him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death</span>. To defile the sabbath was to do any unnecessary servile work upon it. Works of mercy, works of necessity, and works connected with religious observance were not prohibited. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-1.htm">Matthew 12:1-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10.htm">Matthew 10-12</a>.) The penalty of death for breaking the sabbath seems to moderns over-severe; but the erection of sabbath-observance into <span class="accented">the</span> special sacramental sign that Israel was in covenant with God made non-observance an offence of the gravest character. The man who broke the sabbath destroyed, so far as in him lay, the entire covenant between God and his people - not only broke it, but annulled it, and threw Israel out of covenant. Hence, when the sin was committed, no hesitation was felt in carrying out the law. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-32.htm">Numbers 15:32-36</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:12-17 Orders were now given that a tabernacle should be set up for the service of God. But they must not think that the nature of the work, and the haste that was required, would justify them in working at it on sabbath days. The Hebrew word /shabath/ signifies rest, or ceasing from labour. The thing signified by the sabbath is that rest in glory which remains for the people of God; therefore the moral obligation of the sabbath must continue, till time is swallowed up in eternity.</body></html>
