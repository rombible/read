But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelled in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.">Exodus 2:15</a>), or first named him on occasion of receiving him back, in allusion to his recent escape from the host which had been destroyed in the Red Sea.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Eliezer</span>. Eliezer had not been previously mentioned by name; but he was probably the son circumcised by Zipporah, as related in ch. 4:25. We learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-15.htm">1 Chronicles 23:15-17</a>, that he grew to manhood, and had an only son, Rehabiah, whose descendants were in the time of Solomon very numerous. <span class="cmt_word">For the God of my father, said he, was my help</span>. Eliezer means literally, "My God (is my) help." It would seem that Zipporah, when she circumcised her infant son, omitted to name him; but Moses, before dismissing her, supplied the omission, calling him Eliezer, because God had been his help against the Pharaoh who had sought his life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-15.htm">Exodus 2:15</a>), and of whose death he had recently had intelligence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-19.htm">Exodus 4:19</a>). Thus the names of the two sons expressed respectively, the despondency natural to an exile, and the exultant gratitude of one who had just learned that by God's goodness, the term of his banishment was over. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-6 Jethro came to rejoice with Moses in the happiness of Israel, and to bring his wife and children to him.
