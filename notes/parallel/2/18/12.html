He occupied a position similar to that of Melchizedek (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-18.htm" title="And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.">Genesis 14:18</a>), holding a priesthood of the most primitive character, probably as patriarch of his tribe, its head by right of primogeniture. As Abraham acknowledged rightly the priesthood of Melchizedek (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-19.htm" title="And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:">Genesis 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/7-2.htm" title="To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;">Hebrews 7:2-9</a>), so Moses and Aaron rightly acknowledged that of Jethro. They markedly indicated their acceptance of his priestly character by participation in the sacrificial meal, which, as a matter of course, followed his sacrifice. They "ate bread with Moses' father in law" (or rather, <span class= "ital">brother-in-law</span>) "before God."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jethro took a burnt offering</span>. Or "<span class="accented">brought</span> a burnt offering;" as the same verb is rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-2.htm">Exodus 25:2</a>. It is not distinctly related that he offered the victim; but as no other offerer is mentioned, and as he was a priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-1.htm">Exodus 18:1</a>), we may assume that he did so. Moses, Aaron, and the elders, partook of the sacrificial meal, regarding the whole rite as one legitimately performed by a duly qualified person, and so as one in which they could properly participate. Jethro, like Melchisedek (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a>), was recognised as a priest of the true God, though it would seem that the Midianites generally were, a generation later, idolaters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-18.htm">Numbers 25:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To eat bread... before God</span>. This expression designates the feast upon a sacrifice, which was the universal custom of ancient nations, whether Egyptians, Assyrians, Phenicians, Persians, Greeks, or Romans. Except in the case of the "whole burnt offering" (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), parts only of the animals were burnt, the greater portion of the meat being consumed, with bread, at a meal, by the offerer and his friends and relatives <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 18:13-26 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:7-12 Conversation concerning God's wondrous works is good, and edifies. Jethro not only rejoiced in the honour done to his son-in-law, but in all the goodness done to Israel. Standers-by were more affected with the favours God had showed to Israel, than many were who received them. Jethro gave the glory to Israel's God. Whatever we have the joy of, God must have the praise. They joined in a sacrifice of thanksgiving. Mutual friendship is sanctified by joint worship. It is very good for relations and friends to join in the spiritual sacrifice of prayer and praise, as those that meet in Christ. This was a temperate feast; they did eat bread, manna. Jethro must see and taste that bread from heaven, and though a gentile, is welcome: the gentiles are welcomed to Christ the Bread of life.</body></html>
