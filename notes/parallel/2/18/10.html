But it is scarcely likely that they knew God among themselves as "Jehovah." Jethro, however, understanding Moses to speak of the supreme God under that designation, adopted it from him, blessed His name, and expressed his conviction that Jehovah was exalted above all other gods. The pure monotheism of later times scarcely existed as yet. The gods of the nations were supposed to be spiritual beings, really existent, and possessed of considerable power, though very far from omnipotent. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/32-16.htm" title="They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.">Deuteronomy 32:16-17</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed be the Lord</span>.

The heathen blessed God no loss than the Israelites; but Jethro's blessing the Lord (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehovah) is unusual As, however, Moses had attributed his own deliverance, and that of Israel, entirely to Jehovah (verse 8), Jethro, accepting the facts to be as stated, blessed the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">Who hath delivered you</span>. Kalisch takes the plural pronoun to refer to Moses and Aaron; but Aaron seems not to nave been present, since he afterwards "came" (verse 12). It is better to regard Jethro as addressing all those who were in the tent with Moses.
