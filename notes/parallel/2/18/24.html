(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/1-9.htm" title="And I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:">Deuteronomy 1:9-15</a>.) In one particular Moses departed from the counsel given to him. Instead of directly choosing the "able men" himself, he left the selection to the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-13.htm" title="Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.">Deuteronomy 1:13</a>). And contented himself with investing the men chosen with their authority. Comp. the course taken by the apostolic college with respect to the first deacons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/6-3.htm" title="Why, brothers, look you out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.">Acts 6:3-6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Moses hearkened</span>. Moses took the advice tendered him, not immediately, but after the law had been given at Sinai, and the journeying was about to be resumed. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9-15</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:13-27 Here is the great zeal and the toil of Moses as a magistrate. Having been employed to redeem Israel out of the house of bondage, he is a further type of Christ, that he is employed as a lawgiver and a judge among them. If the people were as quarrelsome one with another as they were with God, no doubt Moses had many causes brought before him. This business Moses was called to; it appears that he did it with great care and kindness. The meanest Israelite was welcome to bring his cause before him. Moses kept to his business from morning to night. Jethro thought it was too much for him to undertake alone; also it would make the administration of justice tiresome to the people. There may be over-doing even in well-doing. Wisdom is profitable to direct, that we may neither content ourselves with less than our duty, nor task ourselves beyond our strength. Jethro advised Moses to a better plan. Great men should not only study to be useful themselves, but contrive to make others useful. Care must be taken in the choice of the persons admitted into such a trust. They should be men of good sense, that understood business, and that would not be daunted by frowns or clamours, but abhorred the thought of a bribe. Men of piety and religion; such as fear God, who dare not to do a base thing, though they could do it secretly and securely. The fear of God will best fortify a man against temptations to injustice. Moses did not despise this advice. Those are not wise, who think themselves too wise to be counselled.</body></html>
