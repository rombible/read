Oriental ideas of politeness require such a movement in case of an honoured or even of a welcome visitor (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-2.htm">Genesis 18:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-6.htm">Genesis 32:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-1.htm">Genesis 33:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>; etc.). It was evidently the intention of Moses to receive Jethro with all possible marks of honour and respect. He not only went out to meet him, but <span class="cmt_word">did obeisance</span> to him, as to a superior. <span class="cmt_word">They asked each other of their welfare</span>. Rather "exchanged salutations;" addressed each other mutually with the customary phrase "Peace he unto you." <span class="cmt_word">Came into the tent</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, went together into the tent of Moses, which had been already glanced at in the word "encamped" (verse 5). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:7-12 Conversation concerning God's wondrous works is good, and edifies. Jethro not only rejoiced in the honour done to his son-in-law, but in all the goodness done to Israel. Standers-by were more affected with the favours God had showed to Israel, than many were who received them. Jethro gave the glory to Israel's God. Whatever we have the joy of, God must have the praise. They joined in a sacrifice of thanksgiving. Mutual friendship is sanctified by joint worship. It is very good for relations and friends to join in the spiritual sacrifice of prayer and praise, as those that meet in Christ. This was a temperate feast; they did eat bread, manna. Jethro must see and taste that bread from heaven, and though a gentile, is welcome: the gentiles are welcomed to Christ the Bread of life.</body></html>
