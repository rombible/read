Outward ordinances could not effect this; but, to keep the thought perpetually before- men's minds, a network of external obligations was devised, whereof a specimen is given in the law which follows. The flesh of an animal torn by a carnivorous beast would be doubly unclean: (1) By contact with the unclean carnivorous beast; and (2) through not having all the blood properly drained from it. It was therefore not to be eaten by a Hebrew.<p><span class= "bld">Ye shall cast it to the dogs</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>ye shall do this rather than eat it. The flesh might probably be given, or even sold, to an alien.

You shall not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.">Deuteronomy 14:21</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And ye shall be holy men unto me</span>.

One such law then follows - <span class="accented">Law against eating the flesh of an animal killed by another</span>. The blood of such an animal would not be properly drained from it. Some would remain in the tissues, and thence the antrum would be unclean; again, the carnivorous beast which "tore" it would also be unclean, and by contact would impart of its uncleanness to the other. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall cast it</span> <span class="cmt_word">to the dogs,</span> is probably not intended to exclude the giving or selling of it to an Mien, if one were at hand, according to the permission accorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-21.htm">Deuteronomy 14:21</a>; but points simply to the mode whereby the flesh was to be got rid of, if aliens were not at hand, or if they declined to eat the animals. Dogs were so unclean that they might be fed on anything. Their chief use was to be scavengers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-35.htm">2 Kings 9:35, 36</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22; 1 - 31 Judicial laws. - The people of God should ever be ready to show mildness and mercy, according to the spirit of these laws. We must answer to God, not only for what we do maliciously, but for what we do heedlessly. Therefore, when we have done harm to our neighbour, we should make restitution, though not compelled by law. Let these scriptures lead our souls to remember, that if the grace of God has indeed appeared to us, then it has taught us, and enabled us so to conduct ourselves by its holy power, that denying ungodliness and wordly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, Titus 2:12. And the grace of God teaches us, that as the Lord is our portion, there is enough in him to satisfy all the desires of our souls.</body></html>
