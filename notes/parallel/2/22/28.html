It has been suggested that the true meaning of <span class= "ital">elohim </span>in this place is "judges" (Rosenmller, Zunz, Herxheimer); but to have that sense, the word requires the article. It is best, therefore, to translate by "God," as is done by De Wette, Knobel, Keil, Kalisch, Canon Cook, &c., and to understand the entire passage as intended to connect the sin of cursing a ruler with that of reviling God, the ruler being regarded as God's representative.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span>- <span class="accented">Law against reviling God, or rulers</span>.

We must answer to God, not only for what we do maliciously, but for what we do heedlessly. Therefore, when we have done harm to our neighbour, we should make restitution, though not compelled by law. Let these scriptures lead our souls to remember, that if the grace of God has indeed appeared to us, then it has taught us, and enabled us so to conduct ourselves by its holy power, that denying ungodliness and wordly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, Titus 2:12. And the grace of God teaches us, that as the Lord is our portion, there is enough in him to satisfy all the desires of our souls.</body></html>
