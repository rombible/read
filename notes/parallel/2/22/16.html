The father looked to receive a handsome sum (<span class= "greekheb">????</span>) from the man to whom he consented to betroth his virgin daughter; and required compensation if his daughter's eligibility as a wife was diminished. If the seducer were a person to whom he felt it a degradation to marry his daughter, he might exact from him such a sum as would be likely to induce another to wed her; if he was one whom he could accept as a son-in-law, he might compel him to re-establish his daughter's status by marriage. It might be well if modern societies would imitate the Mosaic code on this point by some similar proviso.<p><span class= "bld">He shall surely endow her</span>--i.e., pay the customary sum to the father.

Rather "seduce." <span class="cmt_word">He shall surely endow her to be his wife</span>. In the East a man commonly pays money, or money's worth, to the parents in order to obtain a wife. The seducer was to comply with this custom, and make over to the damsel's father the sum of fifty shekels of silver (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-29.htm">Deuteronomy 22:29</a>), for his sanction of the marriage. If the father consented, he was compelled to marry the girl, and he was forbidden to repudiate her afterwards (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22; 1 - 31 Judicial laws. - The people of God should ever be ready to show mildness and mercy, according to the spirit of these laws. We must answer to God, not only for what we do maliciously, but for what we do heedlessly. Therefore, when we have done harm to our neighbour, we should make restitution, though not compelled by law. Let these scriptures lead our souls to remember, that if the grace of God has indeed appeared to us, then it has taught us, and enabled us so to conduct ourselves by its holy power, that denying ungodliness and wordly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, Titus 2:12. And the grace of God teaches us, that as the Lord is our portion, there is enough in him to satisfy all the desires of our souls.</body></html>
