They mean simply "interest," and <span class= "ital">"</span>the man who lends upon interest."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-27.</span> - <span class="accented">The law of lending money and borrowing</span>. It is peculiar to the Jewish law to forbid the lending of money at interest by citizen to citizen. In the present passage, and in some others (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7</a>), it might seem that interest was only forbidden in the case of a loan to one who was poor; but the general execration of usury (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-9.htm">Job 24:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-8.htm">Proverbs 28:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-13.htm">Ezekiel 18:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-12.htm">Ezekiel 22:12</a>), and the description of the righteous man as "he that hath not given his money upon usury" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-5.htm">Psalm 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8</a>), seem rather to imply that the practice, so far as Israelites were concerned, was forbidden altogether. On the other hand, it was distinctly declared (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-20.htm">Deuteronomy 23:20</a>) that interest might be taken from strangers. There does not seem to have been any rate of interest which was regarded as excessive, and "usurious," in the modern sense. In Scripture usury means simply interest. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22; 1 - 31 Judicial laws. - The people of God should ever be ready to show mildness and mercy, according to the spirit of these laws. We must answer to God, not only for what we do maliciously, but for what we do heedlessly. Therefore, when we have done harm to our neighbour, we should make restitution, though not compelled by law. Let these scriptures lead our souls to remember, that if the grace of God has indeed appeared to us, then it has taught us, and enabled us so to conduct ourselves by its holy power, that denying ungodliness and wordly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, Titus 2:12. And the grace of God teaches us, that as the Lord is our portion, there is enough in him to satisfy all the desires of our souls.</body></html>
