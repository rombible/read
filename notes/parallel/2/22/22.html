With the stranger are naturally placed the widow and orphan; like him, weak and defenceless; like him, special objects of God's care. The negative precept here given was followed up by numerous positive enactments in favour of the widow and the orphan, which much ameliorated their sad lot. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-11.htm">Exodus 23:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12, 13</a>.) On the whole, these laws appear to have been fairly well observed by the Israelites; but there were times when, in spite of them, poor widows suffered much oppression. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-6.htm">Psalm 94:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-2.htm">Isaiah 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-3.htm">Jeremiah 7:3-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-10.htm">Zechariah 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-14.htm">Matthew 23:14</a>.) The prophets denounce this backsliding in the strongest terms. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall not afflict</span>. The word translated "afflict" is of wide signification. including ill-usage of all kinds. "Oppress," and even "vex," are stronger terms. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22; 1 - 31 Judicial laws. - The people of God should ever be ready to show mildness and mercy, according to the spirit of these laws. We must answer to God, not only for what we do maliciously, but for what we do heedlessly. Therefore, when we have done harm to our neighbour, we should make restitution, though not compelled by law. Let these scriptures lead our souls to remember, that if the grace of God has indeed appeared to us, then it has taught us, and enabled us so to conduct ourselves by its holy power, that denying ungodliness and wordly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, Titus 2:12. And the grace of God teaches us, that as the Lord is our portion, there is enough in him to satisfy all the desires of our souls.</body></html>
