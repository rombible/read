Though, in some real sense, "learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians," still Moses was probably devoid of the technical knowledge requisite for a "superintendent of the works" on the present occasion. At any rate, his other duties imperatively required that he should decline to undertake, in addition to them, so onerous an office. And God had told him whom it would be best for him to set over the work (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-1.htm">Exodus 31:1-6</a>). Accordingly, he now made known to the people that the construction of the tabernacle and its appurtenances would be committed to two men - Bezaleel, the son of Uri, as principal, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, as his assist-ant - who would "teach" those under them what they were to do (ver. 34). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath called</span>, etc See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-2.htm">Exodus 31:2</a>: - "I have called by name Bezaleel," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Of the tribe of Judah</span>. The descent of Bezaleel from Judah has been already traced. (See the comment on Exodus 31:2.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:30-35 Here is the Divine appointment of the master-workmen, that there might be no strife for the office, and that all who were employed in the work might take direction from, and give account to them. Those whom God called by name to his service, he filled with the Spirit of God. Skill, even in worldly employments, is God's gift, and comes from above. But many are ready enough in cutting out work for other people, and can tell what this man or that man should do; but the burdens they bind on others, they themselves will not touch with one of their fingers. Such will fall under the character of slothful servants. These men were not only to devise and to work themselves, but they were to teach others. Those that rule should teach; and those to whom God has given knowledge, should be willing to make it known for the benefit of others.</body></html>
