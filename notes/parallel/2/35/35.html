Rather, "and of the skilful weaver." This clause seems to apply to Aholiab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-23.htm">Exodus 38:23</a>), the preceding one to Bezaleel. <span class="cmt_word">And of the embroiderer</span>. This also applies to Aholiab (1.s.c.). <span class="cmt_word">And of the weaver</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "the ordinary, weaver," who wove a cloth all of one colour. The "skilful weaver" produced a patterned fabric. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>.) The methods of working here spoken of are, all of them, such as were well known in Egypt at the time, and which, consequently, it would have been quite natural for some of the Israelites to have learnt. We are not to suppose that God supernaturally communicated to Bezaleel and Aholiab the technical knowledge required in their occupations, but only that he gave them genius and artistic skill, so that both their designs, and their execution of them, were of unusual excellence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:30-35 Here is the Divine appointment of the master-workmen, that there might be no strife for the office, and that all who were employed in the work might take direction from, and give account to them. Those whom God called by name to his service, he filled with the Spirit of God. Skill, even in worldly employments, is God's gift, and comes from above. But many are ready enough in cutting out work for other people, and can tell what this man or that man should do; but the burdens they bind on others, they themselves will not touch with one of their fingers. Such will fall under the character of slothful servants. These men were not only to devise and to work themselves, but they were to teach others. Those that rule should teach; and those to whom God has given knowledge, should be willing to make it known for the benefit of others.</body></html>
