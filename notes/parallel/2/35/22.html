Rosenmller thinks the <span class= "ital">khakh </span>was a "nose ring;" others make it a "brooch" or "buckle." The last word of the four, <span class= "ital">kumaz, </span>cannot possibly mean "tablets." It comes from a root signifying "rounded," and designates probably a bead necklace, such as was often worn by the Egyptians.

That among the Hebrews gold ornaments were worn by men, as well as by women, is indicated by <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-22.htm">Exodus 3:22</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-2.htm">Exodus 32:2</a>. The Egyptian men at the time of the Exodus wore armlets, bracelets, and sometimes anklets, but not often earrings Earrings, however, had been worn by the household of Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-2.htm">Genesis 35:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Bracelets</span>. Rather, "buckles" or "brooches." Kalisch says, "nose-rings," and so Gesenins and Rosenmuller. <span class="cmt_word">Tablets</span>. Rather, "armlets" (Furst, Cook), or perhaps "necklaces "(Gesenius Kalisch, Knobel). <span class="cmt_word">Every man that offered, offered an offering of gold</span>. It is not meant that every man who offered anything gave with it an offering of gold, but simply that, besides those who brought the articles named there were others who brought gold offerings of some different kind. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:20-29 Without a willing mind, costly offerings would be abhorred; with it, the smallest will be accepted. Our hearts are willing, when we cheerfully assist in promoting the cause of God. Those who are diligent and contented in employments considered mean, are as much accepted of God as those engaged in splendid services. The women who spun the goats' hair were wise-hearted, because they did it heartily to the Lord. Thus the labourer, mechanic, or servant who attends to his work in the faith and fear of God, may be as wise, for his place, as the most useful minister, and he equally accepted of the Lord. Our wisdom and duty consist in giving God the glory and use of our talents, be they many or few.</body></html>
