The necessity of such a re-promulgation had been indicated to him in the last injunctions received before his first descent from Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/31-12.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Exodus 31:12-17</a>), and in acting as he now did, he must be viewed as carrying out those injunctions. The words here put on record are probably not the whole that he said to the people on the subject, but only some main points of his speech. He can scarcely have omitted to tell them that the Sabbath was to be henceforth "a sign" between God and His people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-17.htm" title="It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.">Exodus 31:17</a>).<p>(1) These are the words.--<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-2.htm" title="Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whoever does work therein shall be put to death.">Exodus 35:2</a> is, in the main a repetition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-15.htm" title="Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whoever does any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.">Exodus 31:15</a>, but <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-3.htm" title="You shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations on the sabbath day.">Exodus 35:3</a> is new, or, at any rate, only contained by implication in any previous legislation. Kindling fire was in early times a hard piece of manual work, being effected by the friction of two pieces of dry wood.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the congregation</span>.

Is it nothing to pour contempt upon the blessed day, which a bounteous God has given to us for our growth in grace with the church below, and to prepare us for happiness with the church above?</body></html>
