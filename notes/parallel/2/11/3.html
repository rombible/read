And they spoiled the Egyptians.">Exodus 12:36</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The man Moses.</span>--At first sight there seems a difficulty in supposing Moses to have written thus of himself. "The man" is not a title by which writers of any time or country are in the habit of speaking of themselves; but it is far more difficult to imagine any one but Moses giving him so bald and poor a designation. To other writers he is a "prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-10.htm" title="And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like to Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-27.htm" title="And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.">Luke 24:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-22.htm" title="For Moses truly said to the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you of your brothers, like to me; him shall you hear in all things whatever he shall say to you.">Acts 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-37.htm" title="This is that Moses, which said to the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you of your brothers, like to me; him shall you hear.">Acts 7:37</a>), or "a man of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-1.htm" title="And this is the blessing, with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.">Deuteronomy 33:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-6.htm" title="Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said to him, You know the thing that the LORD said to Moses the man of God concerning me and you in Kadeshbarnea.">Joshua 14:6</a>; Psalms 90, Title; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-2.htm" title="Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brothers, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.">Ezra 3:2</a>), or "the servant of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-1.htm" title="Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying,">Joshua 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-5.htm" title="And Moses truly was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;">Hebrews 3:5</a>); never simply "the man."<p><span class= "bld">Very great.</span>--It has been said that this expression does not comport well with the "meekness" of Moses. But it is the mere statement of a fact, and of one necessary to be stated for the proper understanding of the narrative. Moses, in the course of his long contention as an equal with Pharaoh, had come to be regarded, not only by the courtiers, but by the Egyptians generally, as a great personage--a personage almost on a par with the Pharaoh, whom they revered as a god upon earth. The position to which he had thus attained exerted an important influence on the entire Egyptian people at this time, causing them to be well-inclined towards his countrymen, and willing to make sacrifices in order to help them and obtain their good-will.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord gave the people favour</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> When the time came. See below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-36.htm">Exodus 12:36</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Moreover the man Moses</span>, etc. It has been supposed that this is an interpolation, and argued that Moses, being so "meek" as he was (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-3.htm">Numbers 12:3</a>), would not have spoken of himself in the terms here used. But <span class="cmt_word">very great</span> here only means "very influential;" and the fact is stated, not to glorify Moses, but to account for the ornaments being so generally given. Moreover, it is highly improbable that any other writer than himself would have so baldly and bluntly designated Moses as <span class="cmt_word">the man Moses</span>. (Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-1.htm">Deuteronomy 33:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-5.htm">Deuteronomy 34:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-1.htm">Joshua 1:1, 13, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-2.htm">Joshua 22:2, 4</a>; etc.) The "greatness" which Moses had now attained was due to the powers which he had shown. First of all, he had confounded the magicians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-18.htm">Exodus 8:18, 19</a>); then he had so far impressed the courtiers that a number of them took advantage of one of his warnings and thereby saved their cattle and slaves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-20.htm">Exodus 9:20</a>). Finally, he had forced the entire Court to acknowledge that it lay in his power to destroy or save Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-7.htm">Exodus 10:7</a>). He had after that parleyed with the king very much as an equal (<span class="accented">ib</span>. 8-11; 16 -18). It is no wonder that the Egyptians, who regarded their king as a "great god," were deeply impressed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 11:4 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-3 A secret revelation was made to Moses while in the presence of Pharaoh, that he might give warning of the last dreadful judgment, before he went out. This was the last day of the servitude of Israel; they were about to go away. Their masters, who had abused them in their work, would have sent them away empty; but God provided that the labourers should not lose their hire, and ordered them to demand it now, at their departure, and it was given to them. God will right the injured, who in humble silence commit their cause to him; and none are losers at last by patient suffering. The Lord gave them favour in the sight of the Egyptians, by making it appear how much he favoured them. He also changed the spirit of the Egyptians toward them, and made them to be pitied of their oppressors. Those that honour God, he will honour.</body></html>
