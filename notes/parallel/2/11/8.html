These grandees would come to Moses when the blow fell, and prostrate themselves before him as if he were their king, and beseech him to take his departure with all his nation. The details are given more fully and more graphically in this place than in the subsequent narrative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-31.htm" title="And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as you have said.">Exodus 12:31</a>).<p><span class= "bld">In a great anger.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">in heat of anger: i.e.,</span> burning with indignation. Moses had not shown this in his speech, which had been calm and dignified; but he here records what he had felt. For once his acquired "meekness" failed, and the hot natural temper of his youth blazed up. His life had been threatened--he had been ignominiously dismissed--he had been deprived of his right of audience for the future (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-28.htm" title="And Pharaoh said to him, Get you from me, take heed to yourself, see my face no more; for in that day you see my face you shall die.">Exodus 10:28</a>).

The Egyptians looked on Moses as king, or at any rate prince of his nation. <span class="cmt_word">In a great anger</span>. Literally, "in heat of anger." The abrupt dismissal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-28.htm">Exodus 10:28</a>), the threat against his life (ibid.) and the announcement that no more interviews would be granted him moved the indignation of Moses, who was not conscious to himself of having done anything to deserve such treatment. He had answered the king calmly and temperately (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-29.htm">Exodus 10:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-4.htm">Exodus 11:4-8</a>); but knew what his feelings had been, and here records them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 11:9 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:4-10 The death of all the first-born in Egypt at once: this plague had been the first threatened, but is last executed. See how slow God is to wrath. The plague is foretold, the time is fixed; all their first-born should sleep the sleep of death, not silently, but so as to rouse the families at midnight. The prince was not too high to be reached by it, nor the slaves at the mill too low to be noticed. While angels slew the Egyptians, not so much as a dog should bark at any of the children of Israel. It is an earnest of the difference there shall be in the great day, between God's people and his enemies. Did men know what a difference God puts, and will put to eternity, between those that serve him and those that serve him not, religion would not seem to them an indifferent thing; nor would they act in it with so much carelessness as they do. When Moses had thus delivered his message, he went out from Pharaoh in great anger at his obstinacy; though he was the meekest of the men of the earth. The Scripture has foretold the unbelief of many who hear the gospel, that it might not be a surprise or stumbling-block to us, Ro 10:16. Let us never think the worse of the gospel of Christ for the slights men put upon it. Pharaoh was hardened, yet he was compelled to abate his stern and haughty demands, till the Israelites got full freedom. In like manner the people of God will find that every struggle against their spiritual adversary, made in the might of Jesus Christ, every attempt to overcome him by the blood of the Lamb, and every desire to attain increasing likeness and love to that Lamb, will be rewarded by increasing freedom from the enemy of souls.</body></html>
