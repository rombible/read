Before Moses was summoned to appear in the presence of Pharaoh as related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-24.htm">Exodus 10:24</a>, it had been expressly revealed to him by God, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That one more plague, and one only, was impending; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That this infliction would be effectual, and be followed by the departure of the Israelites; and, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That instead of reluctantly allowing them to withdraw from his kingdom, the monarch would be eager for their departure and would actually hasten it. He had also been told that the time was now come when the promise made to him in Mount Horeb, that his people should "spoil the Egyptians" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-22.htm">Exodus 3:22</a>), would receive its accomplishment. The Israelites, before departing, were to ask their Egyptian neighbours for any articles of gold and silver that they possessed, and would receive them (ver. 2). The reasons for this extraordinary generosity on the part of the Egyptians are then mentioned, in prolongation of the parenthesis. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> God "gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians"; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The circumstances of the time had exalted Moses, and made him be looked upon as "very great" (ver. 3), so that there was a general inclination to carry out his wishes. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord spake unto Moses</span>. Rather, "Now the Lord had said unto Moses." The Hebrew has no form for the pluperfect tease, and is consequently obliged to make up for the grammatical deficiency by using the simple preterite in a pluperfect sense. We cannot definitely fix the time when Moses had received this revelation; but the expression, <span class="cmt_word">one plague more</span>, shows that it was after the commencement of the "<span class="cmt_word">plague of darkness</span>." <span class="cmt_word">When he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out altogether</span>. The Hebrew win not bear this rendering. It runs distinctly thus - "When he shall let you go altogether, he will assuredly thrust you out hence." As Canon Cook notes, "the meaning is - when at last he lets you depart, with children, flocks, herds, and all your possessions, he will compel you to depart in haste" (<span class="accented">Speaker's Commentary</span>, vol. 1. p. 290). It has been well noticed by the same writer that both this announcement, and the previous relentings of Pharaoh, would have caused Moses to have preparations made, and to hold the Israelites in readiness for a start upon their journey almost at any moment. No doubt a most careful and elaborate organization of the people must have been necessary; but there had been abundant time for such arrangements during the twelvemonth that had elapsed since the return of Moses from Midian. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-3 A secret revelation was made to Moses while in the presence of Pharaoh, that he might give warning of the last dreadful judgment, before he went out. This was the last day of the servitude of Israel; they were about to go away. Their masters, who had abused them in their work, would have sent them away empty; but God provided that the labourers should not lose their hire, and ordered them to demand it now, at their departure, and it was given to them. God will right the injured, who in humble silence commit their cause to him; and none are losers at last by patient suffering. The Lord gave them favour in the sight of the Egyptians, by making it appear how much he favoured them. He also changed the spirit of the Egyptians toward them, and made them to be pitied of their oppressors. Those that honour God, he will honour.</body></html>
