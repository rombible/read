The Pharaoh has bidden him "see his face no more" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-28.htm" title="And Pharaoh said to him, Get you from me, take heed to yourself, see my face no more; for in that day you see my face you shall die.">Exodus 10:28</a>), and he has accepted the warning, and declared "I will see thy face again no more" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-29.htm" title="And Moses said, You have spoken well, I will see your face again no more.">Exodus 10:29</a>). It is the last interview--the last interchange of speech. Moses had to deliver himself of a message. Hardened as his heart is, Pharaoh is yet to be allowed "a place for repentance" God announces to him, by the mouth of Moses, the coming destruction of the firstborn--emphasizes the terrible nature of the impending calamity by the announcement that through all Egypt there would be <span class= "ital">"</span>a great cry"--contrasts with their despair the absolute immunity of the Israelites--and finally warns the Pharaoh that he and his people will shortly urge the departure which they now refuse to permit. If Pharaoh had even now relented, it was not too late--the great blows might have been escaped, the death of the firstborn and the destruction of the armed force in the Red Sea. But he had "hardened himself," and then "been hardened," until, practically, the time for relenting was gone by. He remained obdurate, and "would not let the children of Israel go out of his land" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-10.htm" title="And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.">Exodus 11:10</a>).<p><span class= "bld">About midnight.</span>--The particular night was not specified; and the torment of suspense was thus added to the pain of an unintermittent fear. But the dreadful visitation was to come at the dreadest hour of the twenty-four--midnight. Thus much was placed beyond doubt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-8.</span> - The writer returns here to his account of the last interview between Moses and Pharaoh, repeating the introductory words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-29.htm">Exodus 10:29</a> - "and Moses said." Having accepted his dismissal, and declared that he would not see the face of Pharaoh any more (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>), Moses, before quitting the presence, proceeded to announce the last plague, prefacing the announcement, as usual (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-17.htm">Exodus 7:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-2.htm">Exodus 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-1.htm">Exodus 9:1, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-3.htm">Exodus 10:3</a>), with the solemn declaration, which showed that he acted in the matter merely as God's instrument - " Thus saith Jehovah." He makes the announcement with the utmost plainness, noting the exact Lime of the visitation (ver. 4) - its extent (ver. 5) - the terrible "cry" that would follow (ver. 6) the complete exemption of the Israelites (ver. 7) - the message which Pharaoh would send him by his servants, to depart at once - and his own intention of acting on it (ver. 8). Then, without waiting for a reply, in hot anger at the prolonged obstinacy of the monarch, he went out. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">About midnight</span>. - Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29</a>. It would add to the horror of the infliction that it should come in the depth of the night. Probably the night intended was not the next night, but one left purposely indefinite, that terror and suspense might work upon the mind of Pharaoh. Shall I go out. The word "I" is repressed in the original, and is emphatic. This crowning plague Jehovah inflicts by no instrumentality, but takes wholly upon himself. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12, 13, 23, 27, 29</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:4-10 The death of all the first-born in Egypt at once: this plague had been the first threatened, but is last executed. See how slow God is to wrath. The plague is foretold, the time is fixed; all their first-born should sleep the sleep of death, not silently, but so as to rouse the families at midnight. The prince was not too high to be reached by it, nor the slaves at the mill too low to be noticed. While angels slew the Egyptians, not so much as a dog should bark at any of the children of Israel. It is an earnest of the difference there shall be in the great day, between God's people and his enemies. Did men know what a difference God puts, and will put to eternity, between those that serve him and those that serve him not, religion would not seem to them an indifferent thing; nor would they act in it with so much carelessness as they do. When Moses had thus delivered his message, he went out from Pharaoh in great anger at his obstinacy; though he was the meekest of the men of the earth. The Scripture has foretold the unbelief of many who hear the gospel, that it might not be a surprise or stumbling-block to us, Ro 10:16. Let us never think the worse of the gospel of Christ for the slights men put upon it. Pharaoh was hardened, yet he was compelled to abate his stern and haughty demands, till the Israelites got full freedom. In like manner the people of God will find that every struggle against their spiritual adversary, made in the might of Jesus Christ, every attempt to overcome him by the blood of the Lamb, and every desire to attain increasing likeness and love to that Lamb, will be rewarded by increasing freedom from the enemy of souls.</body></html>
