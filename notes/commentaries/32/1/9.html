We may hope that he told with sorrow and shame, justifying God, condemning himself, and explaining to the mariners what a great God Jehovah is. They said to him, Why hast thou done this? If thou fearest the God that made the sea and the dry land, why wast thou such a fool as to think thou couldst flee from his presence? If the professors of religion do wrong, they will hear it from those who make no such profession. When sin has raised a storm, and laid us under the tokens of God's displeasure, we must consider what is to be done to the sin that raised the storm. Jonah uses the language of true penitents, who desire that none but themselves may fare the worse for their sins and follies. Jonah sees this to be the punishment of his iniquity, he accepts it, and justifies God in it. When conscience is awakened, and a storm raised, nothing will turn it into a calm but parting with the sin that caused the disturbance. Parting with our money will not pacify the conscience, the Jonah must be thrown overboard.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jonah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I am an Hebrew - This was the name by which Israel was known to foreigners.

For none really fear God, none fear Him as sons, who do not fear Him in act. To be afraid of God is not to fear Him. To be afraid of God keeps men away from God; to fear God draws them to Him. Here, however, Jonah probably meant to tell them, that the Object of his fear and worship was the One Self-existing God, He who alone is, who made all things, in whose hands are all things. He had told them before, that he had fled "from being before Yahweh." They had not thought anything of this, for they thought of Yahweh, only as the God of the Jews. Now he adds, that He, Whose service he had thus forsaken, was "the God of heaven, Who made the sea and dry land," that sea, whose raging terrified them and threatened their lives. The title, "the God of heaven," asserts the doctrine of the creation of the heavens by God, and His supremacy.<p>Hence, Abraham uses it to his servant <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-7.htm">Genesis 24:7</a>, and Jonah to the pagan mariners, and Daniel to Nebuchadnezzar <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-37.htm">Daniel 2:37</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>; and Cyrus in acknowledging God in his proclamation <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-23.htm">2 Chronicles 36:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2</a>.

Jonah, by using it, at once taught the sailors that there is One Lord of all, and why this evil had fallen on them, because they had himself with them, the renegade servant of God.

The heathen had distinct gods for the "heaven," the "sea," and the "land." Jehovah is the one and only true God of all alike. Jonah at last is awakened by the violent remedy from his lethargy. Jonah was but the reflection of Israel's backsliding from God, and so must bear the righteous punishment. The guilt of the minister is the result of that of the people, as in Moses' case (De 4:21). This is what makes Jonah a suitable type of Messiah, who bore the imputed sin of the people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jonah/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And he said unto them; </span> Jonah freely and readily gives account of himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I am a Hebrew; </span> one that am descended from Heber, whose offspring by Abraham are well known, and probably to these mariners: he saith not, <span class="ital">a Jew</span>, because he was not in strictness of speech, for he was of the tribe of Zebulun; nor an Israelite, distinguished from the Jew, lest he should seem to own himself of that idolatrous faction. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I fear; </span> I worship and serve the true God only; or possibly it may imply that his employment was in the immediate. service of God, as a religious person that had abdicated the world, and dedicated himself to God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The Lord; </span> the eternal and almighty God; yours are upstart gods, and have no power or might, nor can they do any thing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The God of heaven; </span> who first made, now ruleth, and ever will rule the heavens, which none of your gods can pretend to, those heavens from whence you see this storm falleth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Which hath made the sea; </span> that sea which now threatens you for my sake, and threatens me for my sin; my God hath raised the sea in his quarrel to contend thus furiously, and he can, and none but he can, command it to be still. <span class="ital">And the dry land</span>; a description of the earth: you would get thither, but all your gods cannot bring you thither, or give you to set one foot upon it, if my God say no. This is the sum of what Jonah declares, by which he intimateth his innocency from any flagitious crime, as they might imagine him guilty, and yet confesseth the greatness of his sin, which he had before told them, though they understood it not, or thought light of it, he fled from the presence of the Lord. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jonah/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew,....

By this description of God, as the prophet designed to set him forth in his nature and works, so to distinguish him from the gods of Heathens, who had only particular parts of the universe assigned to them, when his Jehovah was Lord of all; but where was the prophet's fear and reverence of God when he fled from him, and disobeyed him? it was not lost, though not in exercise. <p>(g) Antiqu. l. 9. c. 10. sect. 2.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jonah/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jonah/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>.

Convinced that God had miraculously pointed him out as the culprit on whose account the storm was sent, and goaded by the stings of conscience, Jonah loses all his previous indecision and spiritual stupor, and in a manly and straightforward way confesses the truth without disguise. The LXX., reading differently, renders, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;</span>, "A servant of Jehovah am I."

So Abraham calls the Lord the God of heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-7.htm">Genesis 24:7</a>), and Daniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-37.htm">Daniel 2:37, 44</a>) uses the same expression (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-5.htm">Psalm 96:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-11.htm">Jeremiah 10:11</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/amos/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But Jehovah had not only put Israel into possession of Canaan; He had also continually manifested Himself to it as the founder and promoter of its spiritual prosperity. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-11.htm">Amos 2:11</a>. "And I raised up some of your sons as prophets, and some of your young men as dedicated ones (Naziraeans). Ah, is it not so, ye sons of Israel? is the saying of Jehovah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-12.htm">Amos 2:12</a>. But ye made the dedicated drink wine, and ye commanded the prophets, saying, Ye shall not prophesy." The institution of prophecy and the law of the Nazarite were gifts of grace, in which Israel had an advantage over every other nation, and by which it was distinguished above the heathen as the nation of God and the medium of salvation. Amos simply reminds the people of these, and not of earthly blessings, which the heathen also enjoyed, since the former alone were real pledges of the covenant of grace made by Jehovah with Israel; and it was in the contempt and abuse of these gifts of grace that the ingratitude of the nation was displayed in the most glaring light. The Nazarites are placed by the side of the prophets, who proclaimed to the nation the counsel and will of the Lord, because, although as a rule the condition of a Nazarite was merely the consequence of his own free will and the fulfilment of a particular vow, it was nevertheless so far a gift of grace from the Lord, that the resolution to perform such a vow proceeded from the inward impulse of the Spirit of God, and the performance itself was rendered possible through the power of this Spirit alone. (For a general discussion of the law of the Nazarite, see the commentary on <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-2.htm">Numbers 6:2-12</a>, and my biblical Antiquities, 67.) The raising up of Nazarites was not only intended to set before the eyes of the people the object of their divine calling, or their appointment to be a holy nation of God, but also to show them how the Lord bestowed the power to carry out this object. But instead of suffering themselves to be spurred on by these types to strive earnestly after sanctification of life, they tempted the Nazarites to break their vow by drinking wine, from which they were commanded to abstain, as being irreconcilable with the seriousness of their sanctification (see my Bibl. Ant. 67); and the prophets they prohibited from prophesying, because the word of God was burdensome to them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-10.htm">Amos 7:10</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-6.htm">Micah 2:6</a>). </body></html>
