This might make the Ninevites hearken to a man of that nation, that came to them as sent by God. And it is likely that he gave them an account of the miraculous circumstances which attended his own mission.

It condemns the men of the gospel generation, Mt 12:41. A very small degree of light may convince men that humbling themselves before God, confessing their sins with prayer, and turning from sin, are means of escaping wrath and obtaining mercy. The people followed the example of the king. It became a national act, and it was necessary it should be so, when it was to prevent a national ruin. Let even the brute creatures' cries and moans for want of food remind their owners to cry to God. In prayer we must cry mightily, with fixedness of thought, firmness of faith, and devout affections. It concerns us in prayer to stir up all that is within us. It is not enough to fast for sin, but we must fast from sin; and, in order to the success of our prayers, we must no more regard iniquity in our hearts, Ps 66:18. The work of a fast-day is not done with the day. The Ninevites hoped that God would turn from his fierce anger; and that thus their ruin would be prevented. They could not be so confident of finding mercy upon their repentance, as we may be, who have the death and merits of Christ, to which we may trust for pardon upon repentance. They dared not presume, but they did not despair. Hope of mercy is the great encouragement to repentance and reformation. Let us boldly cast ourselves down at the footstool of free grace, and God will look upon us with compassion. God sees who turn from their evil ways, and who do not. Thus he spared Nineveh. We read of no sacrifices offered to God to make atonement for sin; but a broken and a contrite heart, such as the Ninevites then had, he will not despise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jonah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the people of Nineveh believed God; - strictly, "believed in God." To "believe in God" expresses more heart-belief, than to "believe God" in itself need convey. To believe God is to believe what God says, to be true; "to believe in" or "on God" expresses not belief only, but that belief resting in God, trusting itself and all its concerns with Him. It combines hope and trust with faith, and love too, since, without love, there cannot be trust. They believed then the preaching of Jonah, and that He, in Whose Name Jonah spake, had all power in heaven and earth. But they believed further in His unknown mercies; they cast themselves upon the goodness of the hitherto "unknown God." Yet they believed in Him, as the Supreme God, "the" object of awe, the God &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'e&#774;loh&#305;&#770;ym <a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/3-8.htm">Jonah 3:8</a>, &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  ha'e&#774;loh&#305;&#770;ym <a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/3-9.htm">Jonah 3:9</a>, although they knew Him not, as He Is , the Self-Existent One. Jonah does not say how they were thus persuaded.<p>God the Holy Spirit relates the wonders of God's Omnipotence as common everyday things. They are no marvels to Him Who performed them. "He commanded and they were done." He spake with power to the hearts which He had made, and they were turned to Him. Any human means are secondary, utterly powerless, except in "His" hands Who Alone doth all things through whomsoever He doth them. Our Lord tells us that "Jonah" himself "was a sign unto the Ninevites" . Whether then the mariners spread the history,  or howsoever the Ninevites knew the personal history of Jonah, he, in his own person and in what befell him, was a sign to them. They believed that God, Who avenged "his" disobedience, would avenge their's. They believed perhaps, that God must have some great mercy in store for them, Who not only sent His prophet so far from his own land to "them" who had never owned, never worshiped Him, but had done such mighty wonders to subdue His prophet's resistance and to make him go to them.<p>And proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth - It was not then a repentance in word only, but in deed. A fast was at that time entire abstinence from all food until evening; the haircloth was a harsh garment, irritating and afflictive to the body. They who did so, were (as we may still see from the Assyrian sculptures) men of pampered and luxurious habits, uniting sensuality and fierceness. Yet this they did at once, and as it seems, for the 40 days. They "proclaimed a fast." They did not wait for the supreme authority. Time was urgent, and they would lose none of it. In this imminent peril of God's displeasure, they acted as men would in a conflagration. People do not wait for orders to put out a fire, if they can, or to prevent it from spreading. Whoever they were who proclaimed it, whether those in inferior authority, each in his neighborhood, or whether it spread from man to man, as the tidings spread, it was done at once. It seems to have been done by acclamation, as it were, one common cry out of the one common terror. For it is said of them, as one succession of acts, "the men of Nineveh believed in God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth from their great to their little," every age, sex, condition . "Worthy of admiration is that exceeding celerity and diligence in taking counsel, which, although in the same city with the king, perceived that they must provide for the common and imminent calamity, not waiting to ascertain laboriously the king's pleasure." In a city, 60 miles in circumference, some time must needs be lost, before the king could be approached; and we know, in some measure, the forms required in approaching Eastern monarchs of old. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jonah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. believed God&#8212;gave credit to Jonah's message from God; thus recognizing Jehovah as the true God.<p>fast &#8230; sackcloth&#8212;In the East outward actions are often used as symbolical expressions of inward feelings. So fasting and clothing in sackcloth were customary in humiliation. Compare in Ahab's case, parallel to that of Nineveh, both receiving a respite on penitence (1Ki 21:27; 20:31, 32; Joe 1:13).<p>from the greatest &#8230; to the least&#8212;The penitence was not partial, but pervading all classes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jonah/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">So, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">And</span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the people of Nineveh; </span> the inhabitants who heard; they first believed who first heard, and successively others as soon as they heard. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Believed God, </span> speaking by his prophet; they knew their own sins.

Whether the fame of Jonah’s deliverance came to Nineveh before him appears not, nor is it likely it should come so far and so fast, though it were known on the Syrian coast, and about Tyre and Zidon; possibly Jonah might publish it in Nineveh. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Proclaimed a fast; </span> every one called upon other to fast, of cried out it was high time to fast, repent, and supplicate God, so some think; but this passage is an anticipation, tells us what was done, and will tell us afterwards on what grounds, authority, and example it was done. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Put on sackcloth; </span> a ceremony very usual in mournings, private or public, in those countries, and a token of their true mourning; this all did, great and small, rich and poor. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jonah/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So the people of Nineveh believed God,.... Or "in God" (r): in the word of the Lord, as the Targum; they believed there was a God, and that he, in whose name Jonah came, was the true God; they believed the word the prophet spake was not the word of man, but, the word of God; faith came by hearing the word, which is the spring of true repentance, and the root of all good works. Kimchi and R. Jeshuah, in Aben Ezra, suppose that the men of the ship, in which Jonah had been, were at Nineveh; and these testified that they had cast him into the sea, and declared the whole affair concerning him; and this served greatly to engage their attention to him, and believe what he said: but this is not certain; and, besides, their faith was the effect of the divine power that went along with the preaching of Jonah, and not owing to the persuasion of men; <p>and proclaimed a fast; not of themselves, but by the order of their king, as follows; though Kimchi thinks this was before that: <p>and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them; both, with respect to rank and age, so universal were their fasting and mourning; in token of which they stripped themselves of their common and rich apparel, and clothed themselves with sackcloth; as was usual in extraordinary cases of mourning, not only with the Jews, but other nations. <p>(Jonah would be a quite a sight to behold. The digestive juices of the fish would have turned his skin to a most unnatural colour and his hair was most like all gone. Indeed, anyone looking like that would attract your attention and give his message more credence, especially after he told you what had happened to him. A God who creates storms, prepares large fish to swallow a man and preserves him in the fish, would not likely have too much trouble destroying your city. Editor) <p>(r) "in Deum", V.

The Happy Result of Jonah’s Preaching<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">believed God</span>] Or, <span class="bld">believed in God</span>. Three things their faith certainly embraced. They believed in the God of the Hebrews, as the true God. They believed in His power to execute the threat which He had held out. They believed in His mercy and willingness to forgive the penitent. And this was marvellous faith in heathen, contrasting favourably with that of the chosen people. “So great faith” had not been found, “no not in Israel.” What they knew of the Hebrews and their God (for doubtless they recognised in Jonah a <span class="ital">Jewish</span> prophet) may have contributed to the result. That they knew also the miraculous history of Jonah’s mission to them, and so were the better prepared to credit him, appears to be plainly taught us by our Lord. It is difficult to understand how Jonah should have been “a sign unto the Ninevites,” corresponding in any way to the sign, which by His resurrection the “Son of man” was to “the men of that generation,” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-30.htm" title="For as Jonas was a sign to the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.">Luke 11:30</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-38.htm" title="Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from you....">Matthew 12:38-41</a>,) unless they were aware that he had passed, as it were, through death to life again, on his way to preach to them. How that information reached them we have no means of judging certainly. Of course it may have come to them from the lips of Jonah himself, though we have seen reason (see note on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-4.htm" title="And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.">Jonah 3:4</a></span>) to regard that as improbable. Alford speaks of “his preaching after his resurrection to the Ninevites, announcing (for that would necessarily be involved in that preaching) the wonderful judgment of God in bringing him there, and thus making his own deliverance, that he might preach to them, <span class="ital">a sign</span> to that people.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jonah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-9.</span> &sect; 3. <span class="accented">The Ninevites hearken to the cry of Jonah, believe in God, and repent.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Believed God;</span> <span class="accented">believed in God</span>, which implies trust and hope; Vulgate, <span class="accented">crediderunt in Deum.</span> They recognized Jonah as God's messenger; they recognized God's power as able to execute the threat, and they had confidence in his mercy if they repented. This great result has seemed to some incredible, and has occasioned doubts to be east upon the history. But, as we have seen in the Introduction, Jonah's mission occurred probably at a time of national depression, when men's minds were disposed to expect calamity, and anxious to avert it by any means. Other considerations led to the same result. They had heard much of the God of the Hebrews, much of the doings of his great prophets Elijah and Elisha; and now they had in their midst one of these holy men, who, as they were informed, had been miraculously preserved from death in order to carry his message to them; for that it was thus that Jonah was "a sign unto the Ninevites" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-30.htm">Luke 11:30</a>) seems most certain. They saw the Divine inspiration beaming in his look, dictating his utterance, animating his bearing, filling him with courage, confidence, and faith. The credulity with which they received the announcements of their own seers, their national predilection for presages and omens, encouraged them to open their ears to this stranger, and to regard his mission with grave attention. Their own conscience, too, was on the prophet's side, and assisted his words with its powerful pleading. <span class="cmt_word">So they believed in God, and proclaimed a fast.</span> Spontaneously, without any special order from the authorities. Before the final fall of Nineveh, the inscriptions mention, the then king ordered a fast of one hundred days and nights to the gods in order to avert the threatened danger (see a note by Professor Sayce, in G. Smith's 'History of Babylon,' p. 156). <span class="cmt_word">Put on sackcloth</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-13.htm">Joel 1:13</a>). The custom of changing the dress in  token of mourning was not confined to the Hebrews (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-16.htm">Ezekiel 26:16</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/amos/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After this threat directed against the voluptuous women of the capital, the prophecy turns again to all the people. In bitter irony, Amos tells them to go on with zeal in their idolatrous sacrifices, and to multiply their sin. But they will not keep back the divine judgment by so doing. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-4.htm">Amos 4:4</a>. "Go to Bethel, and sin; to Gilgal, multiply sinning; and offer your slain-offerings in the morning, your tithes every three days. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-5.htm">Amos 4:5</a>. And kindle praise-offerings of that which is leavened, and cry out freewill-offerings, proclaim it; for so ye love it, O sons of Israel, is the saying of the Lord, of Jehovah." "Amos here describes how zealously the people of Israel went on pilgrimage to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Beersheba, those places of sacred associations; with what superabundant diligence they offered sacrifice and paid tithes; who they would rather do too much than too little, so that they even burnt upon the altar a portion of the leavened loaves of the praise-offering, which were only intended for the sacrificial meals, although none but unleavened bread was allowed to be offered; and lastly, how in their pure zeal for multiplying the works of piety, they so completely mistook their nature, as to summon by a public proclamation to the presentation of freewill-offerings, the very peculiarity of which consisted in the fact that they had no other prompting than the will of the offerer" (v. Hofmann, Schriftbeweis, ii. 2, p. 373). The irony of the summons to maintain their worship comes out very distinctly in the words &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, and sin, or fall away from God. &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; is not a nominative absolute, "as for Gilgal," but an accusative, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is to be repeated from the first clause. The absence of the copula before &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; does not compel us to reject the Masoretic accentuation, and connect &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; with &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, as Hitzig does, so as to obtain the unnatural thought, "sin ye towards Gilgal." On Gilgal mentioned along with Bethel as a place of idolatrous worship (here and <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-5.htm">Amos 5:5</a>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/9-15.htm">Hosea 9:15</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-12.htm">Hosea 12:12</a>), see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>. Offer your slain-offerings labbo&#772;qer, for the morning, i.e., every morning, like layyo&#772;m in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-21.htm">Jeremiah 37:21</a>. This is required by the parallel lishlo&#772;sheth ya&#770;m&#305;&#772;m, on the three of days, i.e., every three days. &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; ... &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; does not refer to the morning sacrifice prescribed in the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3</a>) - for that is always called &#8219;o&#772;la&#770;h, not zebach - but to slain sacrifices that were offered every morning, although the offering of zebha&#770;ch&#305;&#772;m every morning presupposes the presentation of the daily morning burnt-offering. What is said concerning the tithe rests upon the Mosaic law of the second tithe, which was to be brought every three years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-28.htm">Deuteronomy 14:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>; compare my Bibl. Archol. 71, Anm. 7). The two clauses, however, are not to be understood as implying that the Israelites had offered slain sacrifices every morning, and tithe every three days. Amos is speaking hyperbolically, to depict the great zeal displayed in their worship; and the thought is simply this: "If ye would offer slain sacrifices every morning, and tithe every three days, ye would only thereby increase your apostasy from the living God." The words, "kindle praise-offerings of that which is leavened," have been misinterpreted in various ways. &#1511;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512;, an inf. absol. used instead of the imperative (see Ges. 131, 4, b). According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12-14</a>, the praise-offering (to&#772;da&#770;h) was to consist not only of unleavened cakes and pancakes with oil poured upon them, but also of cakes of leavened bread. The latter, however, were not to be placed upon the altar, but one of them was to be assigned to the priest who sprinkled the blood, and the rest to be eaten at the sacrificial meal. Amos now charges the people with having offered that which was leavened instead of unleavened cakes and pancakes, and with having burned it upon the altar, contrary to the express prohibition of the law in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-11.htm">Leviticus 2:11</a>. His words are not to be understood as signifying that, although outwardly the praise-offerings consisted of that which was unleavened, according to the command of the law, yet inwardly they were so base that they resembled unleavened cakes, inasmuch as whilst the material of the leaven was absent, the true nature of the leaven - namely, malice and wickedness - was there in all the greater quantity (Hengstenberg, Dissertations, vol. i. p. 143 translation). The meaning is rather this, that they were not content with burning upon the altar unleavened cakes made from the materials provided for the sacrifice, but that they burned some of the leavened loaves as well, in order to offer as much as possible to God. What follows answers to this: call out neda&#770;bho&#772;th, i.e., call out that men are to present freewill-offerings. The emphasis is laid upon &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, which is therefore still further strengthened by &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;. Their calling out neda&#770;bho&#772;th, i.e., their ordering freewill-offerings to be presented, was an exaggerated act of zeal, inasmuch as the sacrifices which ought to have been brought out of purely spontaneous impulse (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-18.htm">Leviticus 22:18</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-6.htm">Deuteronomy 12:6</a>), were turned into a matter of moral compulsion, or rather of legal command. The words, "for so ye love it," show how this zeal in the worship lay at the heart of the nation. It is also evident from the whole account, that the worship in the kingdom of the ten tribes was conducted generally according to the precepts of the Mosaic law. </body></html>
