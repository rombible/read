It condemns the men of the gospel generation, Mt 12:41. A very small degree of light may convince men that humbling themselves before God, confessing their sins with prayer, and turning from sin, are means of escaping wrath and obtaining mercy. The people followed the example of the king. It became a national act, and it was necessary it should be so, when it was to prevent a national ruin. Let even the brute creatures' cries and moans for want of food remind their owners to cry to God. In prayer we must cry mightily, with fixedness of thought, firmness of faith, and devout affections. It concerns us in prayer to stir up all that is within us. It is not enough to fast for sin, but we must fast from sin; and, in order to the success of our prayers, we must no more regard iniquity in our hearts, Ps 66:18. The work of a fast-day is not done with the day. The Ninevites hoped that God would turn from his fierce anger; and that thus their ruin would be prevented. They could not be so confident of finding mercy upon their repentance, as we may be, who have the death and merits of Christ, to which we may trust for pardon upon repentance. They dared not presume, but they did not despair. Hope of mercy is the great encouragement to repentance and reformation. Let us boldly cast ourselves down at the footstool of free grace, and God will look upon us with compassion. God sees who turn from their evil ways, and who do not. Thus he spared Nineveh. We read of no sacrifices offered to God to make atonement for sin; but a broken and a contrite heart, such as the Ninevites then had, he will not despise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jonah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For word came - , rather, "And the matter  came," i. e., the "whole account," as we say. "The word, word," throughout Holy Scripture, as in so many languages stands for that which is reported of.  "The whole account," namely, how this stranger, in strange austere attire, had come, what had happened to him before he came, how he preached, how the people had believed him, what they had done, as had just been related, "came to the king." The form of words implies that what Jonah relates in this verse took place after what had been mentioned before. People are slow to carry to sovereigns matters of distress, in which they cannot help. This was no matter of peril from man, in which the counsel or energy of the king could be of use. Anyhow it came to him last. But when it came to him, he disdained not to follow the example of those below him. He was not jealous of his prerogative, or that his advice had not been had; but, in the common peril, acted as his subjects had, and humbled himself as they did. Yet this king was the king of Nineveh, the king, whose name was dreaded far and wide, whose will none who disputed, prospered . "He who was accounted and was the greatest of the kings of the earth, was not held back by any thought of his own splendor, greatness or dignity, from fleeing as a suppliant to the mercy of God, and inciting others by his example to the same earnesthess." The kings of Assyria were religious, according to their light. They ascribed all their victories to their god, Asshur . When the king came to hear of One who had a might such as he had not seen, he believed in Him.<p>And he arose from his throne - He lost no time; he heard, "and he arose" . "It denotes great earnestness, haste, diligence." "And he laid his robe from him." This was the large costly upper garment, so called from its amplitude  It is the name of the goodly Babylonian garment <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-21.htm">Joshua 7:21</a> which Achan coveted. As worn by kings, it was the most magnificent part of their dress, and a special part of their state. Kings were buried as they lived, in splendid apparel;  and rich adornments were buried with them.  The king of Nineveh dreads no charge of precipitancy nor man's judgment . "He exchanges purple, gold, gems for the simple rough and sordid sackcloth, and his throne for the most abject ashes, the humblest thing he could do, fulfilling a deeper degree of humility than is related of the people."<p>Strange credulity, had Jonah's message not been true; strange madness of unbelief which does not repent when a Greater than Jonah cries <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>, "Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Strange garb for the king, in the eyes of a luxurious age; acceptable in His who said <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/11-21.htm">Matthew 11:21</a>, "if the mighty works which have been done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes" . "Many wish to repent, yet so as not to part with their luxuries or the vanity of their dress, like the Greek who said he would 'like to be a philosopher, yet in a few things, not altogether.' To whom we may answer, 'delicate food and costly dress agree not with penitence; and that is no great grief which never comes to light'" . "It was a marvelous thing, that purple was outvied by sackcloth. Sackcloth availed, what the purple robe availed not. What the diadem accomplished not, the ashes accomplished. Seest thou, I said not groundlessly that we should fear, not fasting but drunkenness and satiety? For drunkenness and satiety shook the city through and through, and were about to overthrow it; when it was reeling and about to fall, fasting stablished it" . "The king had conquered enemies by valor; he conquered God by humility. Wise king, who, for the saving of his people, owns himself a sinner rather than a king. He forgets that he is a king, fearing God, the King of all; he remembereth not his own power, coming to own the power of the Godhead. Marvelous! While he remembereth not that he is a king of men, he beginneth to be a king of righteousness. The prince, becoming religious, lost not his empire but changed it. Before, he held the princedom of military discipline; now, he obtained the princedom in heavenly disciplines." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jonah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. in ashes&#8212;emblem of the deepest humiliation (Job 2:8; Eze 27:30).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jonah/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This now accounteth for the people’s proclaiming a fast, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-5.htm" title="So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.">Jonah 3:5</a></span>, they did it because it was commanded, and they had the king’s example herein. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Word came to the king:</span> whether Jonah did particularly speak to his hearers to send word to the king, or whether the strangeness of the thing might move some or other to report it to the courtiers, and they to the king, is not specified; certain it is that the king had word brought him, and it was considered by him: nor is it said who this king was; Sardanapalus seems too early, Pul-belochus is with more probability thought to be this king. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Arose from his throne; </span> came down from his royal seat. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Laid his robe from him; </span> put off his rich, gorgeous, and luxurious apparel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Covered him with sackcloth; </span> put on the rough and uneasy garments of a mourner. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And sat in ashes, </span> as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-3.htm" title="And in every province, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.">Esther 4:3</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-8.htm" title="And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself with; and he sat down among the ashes.">Job 2:8</a> 42:6</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jonah/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For word came unto the king of Nineveh,....

It may be intended by the writer to describe the effect produced in each district of the city as Jonah reached it, <span class="ital">before</span> the Court had any knowledge of what was going on. The people were first impressed, and then their rulers. The tide of penitence and humiliation rose higher and higher, till it reached and included the king and his nobles, and what had been done by spontaneous action, or local authority, received the final sanction and imprimatur of the central government. Whichever view be adopted, the literal translation should be retained.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he arose from his throne</span>, &c.] It is in favour of the view that the people did not wait for the royal edict to commence their fast, that the king himself seems to have been the subject of immediate and strong emotion, as soon as the tidings reached him. He first, as by a resistless impulse, humbled himself to the dust, and then took measures, out of the depth of his humiliation, that his subjects should be humbled with him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The outward form which the humiliation both of king and people took was that common in the East (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-16.htm" title="Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit on the ground, and shall tremble at every moment, and be astonished at you.">Ezekiel 26:16</a>; and see <span class="ital">Dictionary of the Bible</span>, Article <span class="ital">Mourning</span>), as we know both from sacred and secular writings. In the case of the king of Assyria it is the more remarkable both because of his characteristic pride as “the great king” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-19.htm" title="And Rabshakeh said to them, Speak you now to Hezekiah, Thus said the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein you trust?">2 Kings 18:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-28.htm" title="Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spoke, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria:">2 Kings 18:28</a>), and because of the pomp and luxury with which he was ordinarily surrounded. No greater contrast could well be conceived than between the royal “robe” and “sackcloth,” or between the heap of “ashes” and the king’s “throne.” “In the bas-relief I am describing,” writes Layard, “the dress of a king consisted of a long flowing garment, edged with fringes and tassels, descending to his ankles, and confined at the waist by a girdle. Over this robe a second, similarly ornamented and open in front, appears to have been thrown. From his shoulders fell a cape or hood, also adorned with tassels, and to it were attached two long ribbons or lappets. He wore the conical mitre, or tiara, which distinguishes the monarch in Assyrian bas-reliefs, and appears to have been reserved for him alone … Around the neck of the king was a necklace. He wore ear-rings, and his arms, which were bare from a little above the elbow, were encircled by armlets and bracelets remarkable for the beauty of their forms. The clasps were formed by the heads of animals, and the centre by stars and rosettes, probably inlaid with precious stones.” (<span class="ital">Nineveh</span>, abridged edition, 1851, p. 97.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Of the throne the same writer says, “The thrones or arm-chairs, supported by animals and human figures, resemble those of the ancient Egyptians, and of the monuments of Kouyunjik, Khorsabad and Persepolis.

In bitter irony, Amos tells them to go on with zeal in their idolatrous sacrifices, and to multiply their sin. But they will not keep back the divine judgment by so doing. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-4.htm">Amos 4:4</a>. "Go to Bethel, and sin; to Gilgal, multiply sinning; and offer your slain-offerings in the morning, your tithes every three days. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-5.htm">Amos 4:5</a>. And kindle praise-offerings of that which is leavened, and cry out freewill-offerings, proclaim it; for so ye love it, O sons of Israel, is the saying of the Lord, of Jehovah." "Amos here describes how zealously the people of Israel went on pilgrimage to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Beersheba, those places of sacred associations; with what superabundant diligence they offered sacrifice and paid tithes; who they would rather do too much than too little, so that they even burnt upon the altar a portion of the leavened loaves of the praise-offering, which were only intended for the sacrificial meals, although none but unleavened bread was allowed to be offered; and lastly, how in their pure zeal for multiplying the works of piety, they so completely mistook their nature, as to summon by a public proclamation to the presentation of freewill-offerings, the very peculiarity of which consisted in the fact that they had no other prompting than the will of the offerer" (v. Hofmann, Schriftbeweis, ii. 2, p. 373). The irony of the summons to maintain their worship comes out very distinctly in the words &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, and sin, or fall away from God. &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; is not a nominative absolute, "as for Gilgal," but an accusative, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is to be repeated from the first clause. The absence of the copula before &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; does not compel us to reject the Masoretic accentuation, and connect &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; with &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, as Hitzig does, so as to obtain the unnatural thought, "sin ye towards Gilgal." On Gilgal mentioned along with Bethel as a place of idolatrous worship (here and <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-5.htm">Amos 5:5</a>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/9-15.htm">Hosea 9:15</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-12.htm">Hosea 12:12</a>), see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>.

This is required by the parallel lishlo&#772;sheth ya&#770;m&#305;&#772;m, on the three of days, i.e., every three days. &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; ... &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; does not refer to the morning sacrifice prescribed in the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3</a>) - for that is always called &#8219;o&#772;la&#770;h, not zebach - but to slain sacrifices that were offered every morning, although the offering of zebha&#770;ch&#305;&#772;m every morning presupposes the presentation of the daily morning burnt-offering. What is said concerning the tithe rests upon the Mosaic law of the second tithe, which was to be brought every three years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-28.htm">Deuteronomy 14:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>; compare my Bibl. Archol. 71, Anm. 7). The two clauses, however, are not to be understood as implying that the Israelites had offered slain sacrifices every morning, and tithe every three days. Amos is speaking hyperbolically, to depict the great zeal displayed in their worship; and the thought is simply this: "If ye would offer slain sacrifices every morning, and tithe every three days, ye would only thereby increase your apostasy from the living God." The words, "kindle praise-offerings of that which is leavened," have been misinterpreted in various ways. &#1511;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512;, an inf. absol. used instead of the imperative (see Ges. 131, 4, b). According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12-14</a>, the praise-offering (to&#772;da&#770;h) was to consist not only of unleavened cakes and pancakes with oil poured upon them, but also of cakes of leavened bread. The latter, however, were not to be placed upon the altar, but one of them was to be assigned to the priest who sprinkled the blood, and the rest to be eaten at the sacrificial meal. Amos now charges the people with having offered that which was leavened instead of unleavened cakes and pancakes, and with having burned it upon the altar, contrary to the express prohibition of the law in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-11.htm">Leviticus 2:11</a>. His words are not to be understood as signifying that, although outwardly the praise-offerings consisted of that which was unleavened, according to the command of the law, yet inwardly they were so base that they resembled unleavened cakes, inasmuch as whilst the material of the leaven was absent, the true nature of the leaven - namely, malice and wickedness - was there in all the greater quantity (Hengstenberg, Dissertations, vol. i. p. 143 translation). The meaning is rather this, that they were not content with burning upon the altar unleavened cakes made from the materials provided for the sacrifice, but that they burned some of the leavened loaves as well, in order to offer as much as possible to God. What follows answers to this: call out neda&#770;bho&#772;th, i.e., call out that men are to present freewill-offerings. The emphasis is laid upon &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, which is therefore still further strengthened by &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;. Their calling out neda&#770;bho&#772;th, i.e., their ordering freewill-offerings to be presented, was an exaggerated act of zeal, inasmuch as the sacrifices which ought to have been brought out of purely spontaneous impulse (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-18.htm">Leviticus 22:18</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-6.htm">Deuteronomy 12:6</a>), were turned into a matter of moral compulsion, or rather of legal command. The words, "for so ye love it," show how this zeal in the worship lay at the heart of the nation. It is also evident from the whole account, that the worship in the kingdom of the ten tribes was conducted generally according to the precepts of the Mosaic law. </body></html>
