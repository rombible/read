When he was in trouble, under the tokens of God's displeasure against him for sin: when we are in affliction we must pray. Being kept alive by miracle, he prayed. A sense of God's good-will to us, notwithstanding our offences, opens the lips in prayer, which were closed with the dread of wrath. Also, where he prayed; in the belly of the fish. No place is amiss for prayer. Men may shut us from communion with one another, but not from communion with God. To whom he prayed; to the Lord his God. This encourages even backsliders to return. What his prayer was. This seems to relate his experience and reflections, then and afterwards, rather than to be the form or substance of his prayer. Jonah reflects on the earnestness of his prayer, and God's readiness to hear and answer. If we would get good by our troubles, we must notice the hand of God in them. He had wickedly fled from the presence of the Lord, who might justly take his Holy Spirit from him, never to visit him more. Those only are miserable, whom God will no longer own and favour. But though he was perplexed, yet not in despair. Jonah reflects on the favour of God to him, when he sought to God, and trusted in him in his distress. He warns others, and tells them to keep close to God. Those who forsake their own duty, forsake their own mercy; those who run away from the work of their place and day, run away from the comfort of it. As far as a believer copies those who observe lying vanities, he forsakes his own mercy, and lives below his privileges. But Jonah's experience encourages others, in all ages, to trust in God, as the God of salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jonah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When my sold fainted - , literally "was covered, within me," was dizzied, overwhelmed.

The soul of the pious never is so full of God, as when all things else fade from him. Jonah could not but have remembered God in the tempest; when the lots were east; when he adjudged himself to be east forth. But when it came to the utmost, then he says, "I remembered the Lord," as though, in the intense thought of God then, all his former thought of God had been forgetfulness. So it is in every strong act of faith, of love, of prayer; its former state seems unworthy of the name of faith, love, prayer. It believes, loves, prays, as though all before had been forgetfulness.<p>And my prayer came in unto Thee - No sooner had he so prayed, than God heard. Jonah had thought himself cast out of His sight; but his prayer entered in there. "His holy temple" is doubtless His actual temple, toward which he prayed. God, Who is wholly everywhere but the whole of Him nowhere, was as much in the temple as in heaven; and He had manifested Himself to Israel in their degree in the temple, as to the blessed saints and angels in heaven. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jonah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. soul fainted &#8230; I remembered the Lord&#8212;beautifully exemplifying the triumph of spirit over flesh, of faith over sense (Ps 73:26; 42:6).

"Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, An enemy, and that round about the land; and he will hurl down thy glory from thee, and thy palaces are plundered. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-12.htm">Amos 3:12</a>. Thus saith Jehovah, As the shepherd delivers out of the mouth of the lion two shin-bones or an ear-lappet, so will the sons of Israel deliver themselves; they who sit on the corner of the couch and on the damask of the bed." The threat is introduced in the form of an aposiopesis. &#1510;&#1512;, enemy, &#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, and indeed round about the land (  &#1493; explic. as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/4-10.htm">Amos 4:10</a>, etc.; and &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; in the construct state construed as a preposition), i.e., will come, attack the land on all sides, and take possession of it. Others regard &#1510;&#1512; as an abstract: oppression (from the Chaldee); but in this case we should have to supply Jehovah as the subject to &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491;; and although this is probable, it is by no means natural, as Jehovah is speaking. There is no foundation, on the other hand, for the remark, that if tsar signified the enemy, we should either find the plural &#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, or &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512; with the article (Baumgarten). The very indefiniteness of tsar suits the sententious brevity of the clause. This enemy will hurl down the splendour of Samaria, "which ornaments the top of the mountain like a crown, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1-3</a>" (Hitzig: &#1506;&#1494;, might, with the subordinate idea of glory), and plunder the palaces in which violence, i.e., property unrighteously acquired, is heaped up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-10.htm">Amos 3:10</a>). The words are addressed to the city of Samaria, to which the feminine suffixes refer. On the fall of Samaria, and the plundering thereof, the luxurious grandees, who rest upon costly pillows, will only be able to save their life to the very smallest extent, and that with great difficulty. In the simile used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-12.htm">Amos 3:12</a> there is a slight want of proportion in the two halves, the object of the deliverance being thrown into the background in the second clause by the passive construction, and only indicated in the verb, to deliver themselves, i.e., to save their life. "A pair of shin-bones and a piece (&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;.), i.e., a lappet, of the earth," are most insignificant remnants. The grandees of Samaria, of whom only a few were to escape with their life, are depicted by Amos as those who sit on costly divans, without the least anxiety. &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;, the corner of the divan, the most convenient for repose. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4</a>, these divans were ornamented with ivory, and according to the verse before us, they were ornamented with costly stuffs. &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511; comes from &#1491;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511;, Damascus, and signifies damask, an artistically woven material (see Ges. Thes. p. 346). This brings the visitation of God to an end. Even the altars and palaces are to be laid in ruins, and consequently Samaria will be destroyed. </body></html>
