Those who have fretful, uneasy spirits, often make troubles for themselves, that they may still have something to complain of. See how tender God is of his people in their afflictions, even though they are foolish and froward. A thing small in itself, yet coming seasonably, may be a valuable blessing. A gourd in the right place may do us more service than a cedar. The least creatures may be great plagues, or great comforts, as God is pleased to make them. Persons of strong passions are apt to be cast down with any trifle that crosses them, or to be lifted up with a trifle that pleases them. See what our creature-comforts are, and what we may expect them to be; they are withering things. A small worm at the root destroys a large gourd: our gourds wither, and we know not what is the cause. Perhaps creature-comforts are continued to us, but are made bitter; the creature is continued, but the comfort is gone. God prepared a wind to make Jonah feel the want of the gourd. It is just that those who love to complain, should never be left without something to complain of. When afflicting providences take away relations, possessions, and enjoyments, we must not be angry at God. What should especially silence discontent, is, that when our gourd is gone, our God is not gone. Sin and death are very dreadful, yet Jonah, in his heat, makes light of both. One soul is of more value than the whole world; surely then one soul is of more value than many gourds: we should have more concern for our own and others' precious souls, than for the riches and enjoyments of this world. It is a great encouragement to hope we shall find mercy with the Lord, that he is ready to show mercy. And murmurers shall be made to understand, that how willing soever they are to keep the Divine grace to themselves and those of their own way, there is one Lord over all, who is rich in mercy to all that call upon him. Do we wonder at the forbearance of God towards his perverse servant? Let us study our own hearts and ways; let us not forget our own ingratitude and obstinacy; and let us be astonished at God's patience towards us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jonah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God prepared a vehement - o (The English margin following the Chaldee, "silent," i. e., "sultry").<p>East wind - The winds in the East, blowing over the sand-deserts, intensely increase the distress of the heat. A sojourner describes on two occasions an Assyrian summer . "The change to summer had been as rapid as that which ushered in the spring. The verdure of the plain had perished almost in a day. Hot winds, coming from the desert, had burned up and carried away the shrubs. The heat was now almost intolerable. Violent whirl-winds occasionally swept over the face of the country."  "The spring was now fast passing away; the heat became daily greater; the grain was cut; and the plains and hills put on their summer clothing of dull parched yellow. "The pasture is withered, the herbage faileth; the green grass is not." It was the season too of the Sherghis, or burning winds from the south, which occasionally swept over the face of the country, driving in their short-lived fury everything before them.<p>We all went below (ground) soon after the sun had risen, and remained there (in the tunnels) without again seeking the open air until it was far down in the Western horizon." The "Sherghi" must be rather the East wind, Sherki, whence Sirocco. At Sulimania in Kurdistan (about 2 12 degrees east of Nineveh, and 34 of a degree south)  "the so much dreaded Sherki seems to blow from any quarter, from east to northeast. It is greatly feared for its violence and relaxing qualities,"  "hot, stormy and singularly relaxing and dispiriting." Suffocating heat is a characteristic of these vehement winds. Morier relates at Bushire ; He continues, "Again from the 23rd to the 25th, the wind blew violently from the southeast accompanied by a most suffocating heat, and continued to blow with the same strength until the next day at noon, when it suddenly veered round to the northwest with a violence equal to what it had blown from the opposite point." And again (p. 97) "When there was a perfect calm, partial and strong currents of air would arise and form whirlwinds which produced high columns of sand all over the plain. They are looked upon as the sign of great heat. Their strength was very various. Frequently they threw down our tents."<p>Burckhardt, when professedly lessening the general impression as to these winds says, "The worst effect (of the Semoum "a violent southest wind") is that it dries up the water in the skins, and so far endangers the traveler's safety. In one morning 13 of the contents of a full water skin was evaporated. I always observed the whole atmosphere appear as it in a state of combustion; the dust and sand are carried high into the air, which assumes a reddish or blueish or yellowish tint, according to the nature and color of the ground from which the dust arises. The Semoum is not always accompanied by whirlwinds: in its less violent degree it will blow for hours with little force, although with oppressive heat; when the whirlwind raises the dust, it then increases several degrees in heat. In the Semoum at Esne, the thermometer mounted to 121 degrees in the shade, but the air seldom remains longer than a quarter of an hour in that state or longer than the whirlwind lasts.<p>The most disagreeable effect of the Semoum upon man is, that it stops perspiration, dries up the palate, and produces great restlessness." Travels in Nubia, pp. 204-205.) "A gale of wind blew from the Southward and Eastward with such violence, that three of our largest tents were leveled with the ground. The wind brought with it such hot currents of air, that we thought it might be the precursor of the "Samoun" described by Chardin, but upon inquiry, we found that the autumn was generally the season for that wind. The "Sam" wind commits great ravages in this district. It blows at night from about midnight to sunrise, comes in a hot blast, and is afterward succeeded by a cold one. About 6 years ago, there was a "sam" during the summer months which so totally burned up all the grain, then near its maturity, that no animal would eat a blade of it, nor touch any of its grain."<p>The sun beat upon the head of Jonah - o. "Few European travelers can brave the perpendicular rays of an Assyrian sun. Even the well-seasoned Arab seeks the shade during the day, and journeys by night, unless driven forth at noontide by necessity, or the love of war."<p>He wished in himself to die - (literally he asked as to his soul, to die). He prayed for death. It was still the same dependence upon God, even in his self-will. He did not complain, but prayed God to end his life here. When men are already vexed in soul by deep inward griefs, a little thing often oversets patience. Jonah's hopes had been revived by the mercy of the palm-christ; they perished with it. Perhaps he had before him the thought of his great predecessor, Elijah, how he too wished to die, when it seemed that his mission was fruitless. They differed in love. Elijah's preaching, miracles, toil, sufferings, seemed to him, not only to be in vain, but (as they must, if in vain), to add to the guilt of his people. God corrected him too, by showing him his own short-sightedness, that he knew not of "the seven thousand who had not bowed their knees unto Baal," who were, in part, doubtless, "the travail of his soul." Jonah's mission to his people seemed also to be fruitless; his hopes for their well-being were at an end; the temporal mercies of which he had been the prophet, were exhausted; Nineveh was spared; his last hope was gone; the future scourge of his people was maintained in might. The soul shrinks into itself at the sight of the impending visitation of its country. But Elijah's zeal was "for" his people only and the glory of God in it, and so it was pure love. Jonah's was directed "against" the Ninevites, and so had to be purified. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jonah/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. vehement&#8212;rather, "scorching"; the Margin, "silent," expressing sultry stillness, not vehemence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jonah/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And it came to pass, </span> after all these passages both in chastising and refreshing Jonah, and after all Jonah’s deportment under them, but more immediately after the withering of the gourd and the loss of the shadow. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">When the sun did arise; </span> with the rising of the sun, so early in the morning as the sun arose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">God prepared; </span> by a particular command from God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A vehement east wind; </span> a dry, scorching, blasting wind wherever it blows, but more than ordinarily so in those climates, and most so when sent out on such an errand by the Lord. <span class="ital">Silent</span>, saith the Hebrew.

After that the gourd was smitten and withered; when it was not only risen, but shone out with great force and heat: <p>that God prepared a vehement east wind; or, "a deafening east wind" (u); which blew so strong, and so loud, as R. Marinus in Aben Ezra and Kimchi say, made people deaf that heard it: or, "a silencing east wind"; which when it blew, all other winds were silent, as Jarchi: or it made men silent, not being to be heard for it: or, "a silent" (w), that is, a still quiet wind, as the Targum; which blew so gently and slowly, that it increased the heat, instead of lessening it: or rather "a ploughing east wind" (x); such as are frequent (y) in the eastern countries, which plough up the dry land, cause the sand to arise and cover men and camels, and bury them in it. Of these winds Monsieur Thevenot (z) speaks more than once; in sandy deserts, between Cairo and Suez, he says, <p>"it blew so furiously, that I thought all the tents would have been carried away with the wind; which drove before it such clouds of sand, that we were almost buried under it; for seeing nobody could stay outside, without having mouth and eyes immediately filled with sand, we lay under the tents, where the wind drove in the sand above a foot deep round about us;'' <p>and in another place he observes (a). <p>"from Suez to Cairo, for a day's time or more, we had so hot a wind, that we were forced to turn our backs to it, to take a little breath, and so soon as we opened our mouths they were full of sand;'' <p>such an one was here raised, which blew the sand and dust into the face of Jonah, and almost suffocated him; which, with the heat of the sun, was very afflictive to him: <p>and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted; the boughs of trees, of which the booth was made, being withered, and his gourd, or whatever plant it was, also, he had nothing to shelter him from the heat of the sun; but the beams of it darted directly upon him, so that he was not able to sustain them; they quite overwhelmed him, and caused him to faint, and just ready to die away: <p>and wished in himself to die; or, "desired his soul might die" (b); not his rational soul, which was immortal; by this animal or sensitive soul, which he had in common with animals; he wished his animal life might be taken from him, because the distress through the wind and sun was intolerable to him: <p>and said, it is better for me to die than to live; in so much pain and misery; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-3.htm">Jonah 4:3</a>. <p>(u) "surdefacientem", Munster; "ex surdentem", Montanus; "surdum", Drusius.

This, or <span class="ital">sultry</span>, R.V., is probably the true meaning of the word. “We have two kinds of sirocco,” writes Dr Thomson, “one accompanied with vehement wind which fills the air with dust and fine sand … The sirocco to-day is of the quiet kind, and they are often more overpowering than the others. I encountered one a year ago on my way from Lydd to Jerusalem. There is no living thing abroad to make a noise. The birds hide in thickest shades; the fowls pant under the walls with open mouth and drooping wings; the flocks and herds take shelter in caves and under great rocks; the labourers retire from the fields, and close the windows and doors of their houses; and travellers hasten, as I did, to take shelter in the first cool place they can find. No one has energy enough to make a noise, and the very air is too weak and languid to stir the pendent leaves of the tall poplars.” <span class="ital">Land and Book</span>, pp. 536, 537. The occurrence of this wind at sunrise is referred to as a usual thing by St James, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-11.htm" title="For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it wither the grass, and the flower thereof falls, and the grace of the fashion of it perishes: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.">James 1:11</a>, where the same Greek word (καύσων) is used for “burning heat” as is used by the LXX. here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">fainted</span>] It is the same word as occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-14.htm" title="And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him to wife.">Genesis 38:14</a>, “<span class="ital">covered her with a veil</span>,” veiled herself, the reference being either to the film that comes over the eyes in fainting and exhaustion, or to the clouding of the mental powers from the same cause. This word is used again of fainting from thirst in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-13.htm" title="In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.">Amos 8:13</a>, and a similar word in the same metaphorical sense in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-7.htm" title="When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in to you, into your holy temple.">Jonah 2:7</a> of this book, where see note.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">wished in himself to die</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">asked for his life to die</span>. Exactly the same expression occurs with reference to Elijah when he was fleeing from the wrath of Jezebel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-4.htm" title="But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.">1 Kings 19:4</a>. The meaning of the phrase seems to be that the prophet, both in the one case and in the other, recognizing that his life was not his own, but God’s, asked for it of Him as a gift or boon, that he might do with it what he pleased. Then the object with which he asked for it, the way in which he would have it disposed of, is expressed by the word “to die,” or “for death.” Hezekiah might have asked for his life, as indeed he did, in his grievous sickness, but it was not “to die,” but “to live.” The example of Elijah may perhaps have been in Jonah’s mind when he penned these words, or even when he gave vent to his impatient desire to die. If the Jewish tradition that Jonah was the son of the widow of Zarephath and the “servant” whom he left at Beersheba, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-3.htm" title="And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.">1 Kings 19:3</a>, could be accepted, this would be the more probable. The cases of the two prophets were however in reality very different. Both were weary of life. Both desired to die. Both gave expression to their desire in the same words. But here the resemblance ends. Elijah’s was a noble disappointment. “On Carmel the great object for which Elijah had lived seemed on the point of being realised. Baal’s prophets were slain, Jehovah acknowledged with one voice: false worship put down. Elijah’s life aim—the transformation of Israel into a kingdom of God—was all but accomplished. In a single day all this bright picture was annihilated.” (Robertson.) But Jonah’s was a far less worthy grief. It was not that God’s kingdom was overthrown in Israel, but that it was extended to the heathen world, that made him weary of his life. Elijah grieved because he had failed in his efforts to convert and save Israel; Jonah because he had succeeded in converting and saving Nineveh.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">It is better &c.</span>] The words “<span class="ital">It is</span>” which, as the italics in A.V. show, are not in the original, are better omitted: “<span class="ital">And said, Better for me to die than to live</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The excess of Jonah’s joy and grief over the bestowal and loss of the gourd was partly due to his sanguine and impulsive character. But the influence here ascribed to physical circumstances over the mind, especially when it is burdened with a great grief, is very true to nature. “We would fain believe that the mind has power over the body, but it is just as true that the body rules the mind. Causes apparently the most trivial: a heated room—want of exercise—a sunless day—a northern aspect—will make all the difference between happiness and unhappiness, between faith and doubt, between courage and indecision.” (Robertson.)<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jonah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-11.</span> - &sect; 4. <span class="accented">Jonah grieves bitterly for the loss of the gourd</span>; <span class="accented">and God takes occasion from this to point out the prophet's inconsistency and pitilessness in murmuring against the mercy shown to Nineveh with its multitude of inhabitants.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A vehement east wind;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-11.htm">James 1:11</a>) <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> "a scorching, burning wind;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">vento calido et urenti</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-15.htm">Hosea 13:15</a>). The word translated "vehement" is also rendered "silent," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> sultry. Pusey and Hitzig rather incline to think it may mean the autumn or harvest wind. Either interpretation is suitable, as, according to Dr. Thomson, there are two kinds of sirocco, equally destructive and annoying - the violent wind, which fills the air with dust and sand; and the quiet one, when scarcely any air is stirring, but the heat is most overpowering ('The Land and the Book,' p. 536, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Beat upon the head</span>. The same word for the effect of the rays of the sun as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-6.htm">Psalm 121:6</a> and elsewhere. Trochon quotes Ovid, 'Metam ,' 7:804 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Sole fere radiis feriente cacumiua primis."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The sun with earliest rays<br />Scarce smiting highest peaks."</span> Rich, 'Koordistan,' 1:125, "Just as the moon rose, about ten, an intolerable puff of wind came from the northeast. All were immediately silent, as if they had felt an earthquake, and then exclaimed, in a dismal tone, 'The sherki is come.' This was indeed the so much-dreaded sherki, and it has continued blowing ever since with great violence from the east and northeast, the wind being heated like our Bagdad sauna, but I think softer and more relaxing. This wind is the terror of these parts." "Few European travellers," says Layard ('Nin. and Babyl.,' p. 366), "can brave the perpendicular rays of an Assyrian sun. Even the well seasoned Arab seeks the shade during the day, and journeys by night unless driven forth by necessity or the love of war" (quoted by Dr. Pusey, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). He fainted (see note on Amos 8:13, where  the fame word is used of the effects of thirst: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-7.htm">Jonah 2:7</a>). His position on the east of the city (ver. 5) exposed him to the full force of the scorching sun and wind. <span class="cmt_word">Wished in himself to die;</span> literally, <span class="accented">asked for his soul to die</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "despaired of his life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>). The expression implies that he asked God to grant him his life to do with it what he liked. In his self-will and impatience he still shows his dependence upon God. He may have had in his mind the precedent of his great master Elijah, though his spirit is very different (see note on ver. 3 above). <span class="cmt_word">Better for me to die</span>. His wish for death arose from his now assured conviction that God's mercy was extended to the heathen. He argued from the sudden withering of the gourd that he was not to stay there and see the accomplishment of his wishes, and, in his impatience and intolerance, he would rather die than behold Nineveh converted and saved. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/amos/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The short, cursory explanation of the reason for the lamentation opened here, is followed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-4.htm">Amos 5:4</a>. by the more elaborate proof, that Israel has deserved to be destroyed, because it has done the very opposite of what God demands of His people. God requires that they should seek Him, and forsake idolatry, in order to live (<a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-4.htm">Amos 5:4-6</a>); but Israel on the contrary, turns right into unrighteousness, without fearing the almighty God and His judgment (<a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-7.htm">Amos 5:7-9</a>). This unrighteousness God must punish (<a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10-12</a>). <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-4.htm">Amos 5:4</a>.

Seek Jehovah, and live; that He fall not upon the house of Joseph like fire, and it devour, and there be none to quench it for Bethel." The k&#305;&#772; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-4.htm">Amos 5:4</a> is co-ordinate to that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-3.htm">Amos 5:3</a>, "Seek me, and live," for "Seek me, so shall ye live." For this meaning of two imperatives, following directly the one upon the other, see Gesenius, 130, 2, and Ewald, 347, b. &#1495;&#1497;&#1492;, not merely to remain alive, not to perish, but to obtain possession of true life. God can only be sought, however, in His revelation, or in the manner in which He wishes to be sought and worshipped. This explains the antithesis, "Seek not Bethel," etc. In addition to Bethel and Gilgal (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-4.htm">Amos 4:4</a>), Beersheba, which was in the southern part of Judah, is also mentioned here, being the place where Abraham had called upon the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-33.htm">Genesis 21:33</a>), and where the Lord had appeared to Isaac and Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-24.htm">Genesis 26:24</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-1.htm">Genesis 46:1</a>; see also at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a>). These sacred reminiscences from the olden time had caused Beersheba to be made into a place of idolatrous worship, to which the Israelites went on pilgrimage beyond the border of their own kingdom (&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;). But visiting these idolatrous places of worship did no good, for the places themselves would be given up to destruction. Gilgal would wander into captivity (an expression used here on account of the similarity in the ring of &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; &#1497;&#1490;&#1500;&#1492;). Bethel would become 'a&#770;ven, that is to say, not "an idol" here, but "nothingness," though there is an allusion to the change of Beth-el (God's house) into Beth-'a&#770;ven (an idol-house; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>). The Judaean Beersheba is passed over in the threat, because the primary intention of Amos is simply to predict the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes. After this warning the prophet repeats the exhortation to seek Jehovah, and adds this threatening, "that Jehovah come not like fire upon the house of Joseph" (tsa&#770;lach, generally construed with &#8219;al or 'el, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-19.htm">Judges 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-14.htm">Judges 15:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-6.htm">1 Samuel 10:6</a>; here with an accusative, to fall upon a person), "and it (the fire) devour, without there being any to extinguish it for Bethel." Bethel, as the chief place of worship in Israel, is mentioned here for the kingdom itself, which is called the "house of Joseph," from Joseph the father of Ephraim, the most powerful tribe in that kingdom.<p>To add force to this warning, Amos (<a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-7.htm">Amos 5:7-9</a>) exhibits the moral corruption of the Israelites, in contrast with the omnipotence of Jehovah as it manifests itself in terrible judgments. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-7.htm">Amos 5:7</a>. "They that change right into wormwood, and bring righteousness down to the earth. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-8.htm">Amos 5:8</a>. He that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into morning, and darkeneth day to night: that calleth to the waters of the sea, and poureth them over the surface of the earth; Jehovah is His name. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-9.htm">Amos 5:9</a>. Who causeth desolation to flash upon the strong, and desolation cometh upon the fortress." The sentences in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-7.htm">Amos 5:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-8.htm">Amos 5:8</a> are written without any connecting link. The participle in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-7.htm">Amos 5:7</a> cannot be taken as an address, for it is carried on in the third person (hinn&#305;&#772;chu&#772;), not in the second. And haho&#772;phekh&#305;&#772;m (who turn) cannot be in apposition to Beth-el, since the latter refers not to the inhabitants, but to the houses. As Amos is generally fond of a participial construction (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-7.htm">Amos 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>), so in a spirited address he likes to utter the thoughts one after another without any logical link of connection. As a matter of fact, haho&#772;phekh&#305;&#772;m is connected with be&#772;th-yo&#772;se&#772;ph (the house of Joseph), "Seek the Lord, ye of the house of Joseph, who turn right into wrong;" but instead of this connection, he proceeds with a simple description, They are turning," etc. La&#8219;a&#774;na&#770;h, wormwood, a bitter plant, is a figurative term denoting bitter wrong (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-12.htm">Amos 6:12</a>), the actions of men being regarded, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-17.htm">Deuteronomy 29:17</a>, as the fruits of their state of mind. Laying righteousness on the ground (hinn&#305;&#772;a&#774;ch from nu&#772;a&#774;ch) answers to our "trampling under feet." Hitzig has correctly explained the train of thought in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-7.htm">Amos 5:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-8.htm">Amos 5:8</a> : "They do this, whereas Jehovah is the Almighty, and can bring destruction suddenly upon them." To show this antithesis, the article which takes the place of the relative is omitted from the participles &#8219;o&#772;se&#772;h and ho&#772;phe&#772;kh. The description of the divine omnipotence commences with the creation of the brightly shining stars; then follow manifestations of this omnipotence, which are repeated in the government of the world. K&#305;&#772;ma&#770;h, lit., the crowd, is the group of seven stars, the constellation of the Pleiades. Kes&#305;&#772;l, the gate, according to the ancient versions the giant, is the constellation of Orion. The two are mentioned together in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-9.htm">Job 9:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-31.htm">Job 38:31</a> (see Delitzsch on the latter). And He also turns the darkest night into morning, and darkens the day into night again. These words refer to the regular interchange of day and night; for tsalma&#770;veth, the shadow of death, i.e., thick darkness, never denotes the regularly recurring gloominess of night, but the appalling gloom of night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-17.htm">Job 24:17</a>), more especially of the night of death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-5.htm">Job 3:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-17.htm">Job 38:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-20.htm">Psalm 44:20</a>), the unlighted depth of the heart of the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-3.htm">Job 28:3</a>), the darkness of the prison (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-10.htm">Psalm 107:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-14.htm">Psalm 107:14</a>), also of wickedness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-22.htm">Job 12:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-22.htm">Job 34:22</a>), of sufferings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-16.htm">Job 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-16.htm">Jeremiah 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>), and of spiritual misery (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>). Consequently the words point to the judicial rule of the Almighty in the world. As the Almighty turns the darkness of death into light, and the deepest misery into prosperity and health,<p>(Note: Theodoret has given a correct explanation, though he does not quite exhaust the force of the words: "It is easy for Him to turn even the greatest dangers into happiness; for by the shadow of death he means great dangers. And it is also easy to bring calamity upon those who are in prosperity.")<p>so He darkens the bright day of prosperity into the dark night of adversity, and calls to the waters of the sea to pour themselves over the earth like the flood, and to destroy the ungodly. The idea that by the waters of the sea, which pour themselves out at the call of God over the surface of the earth, we are to understand the moisture which rises from the sea and then falls upon the earth as rain, no more answers to the words themselves, than the idea expressed by Hitzig, that they refer to the water of the rivers and brooks, which flow out of the sea as well as into it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:7</a>). The words suggest the thought of terrible inundations of the earth by the swelling of the sea, and the allusion to the judgment of the flood can hardly be overlooked. This judicial act of the Almighty, no strong man and no fortress can defy. With the swiftness of lightning He causes desolation to smite the strong man. Ba&#770;lag, lit., micare, used in the Arabic to denote the lighting up of the rays of the dawn, hiphil to cause to light up, is applied here to motion with the swiftness of lightning; it is also employed in a purely metaphorical sense for the lighting up of the countenance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-14.htm">Psalm 39:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-27.htm">Job 9:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-20.htm">Job 10:20</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-9.htm">Amos 5:9</a> the address is continued in a descriptive form; &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; has not a causative meaning. The two clauses of this verse point to the fate which awaits the Israelites who trust in their strength and their fortifications (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-13.htm">Amos 6:13</a>). And yet they persist in unrighteousness. </body></html>
