But why, inquires Sir Walter Raleigh, (see his History of the World, 50:2, c. 19, § 6,) in all these confusions, and revolutions of the kingdom of Israel, did they never think of returning to the house of David? Probably, observes he, because the kings of Judah assumed a more absolute power over their subjects than the kings of Israel. It was the heaviness of the yoke which they complained of, when they first revolted from the house of David. And it is not unlikely but the dread of that made them averse to it ever after.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:15-28 When men forsake God, they will be left to plague one another. Proud aspiring men ruin one another. Omri struggled with Tibni some years. Though we do not always understand the rules by which God governs nations and individuals in his providence, we may learn useful lessons from the history before us. When tyrants succeed each other, and massacres, conspiracies, and civil wars, we may be sure the Lord has a controversy with the people for their sins; they are loudly called to repent and reform. Omri made himself infamous by his wickedness. Many wicked men have been men of might and renown; have built cities, and their names are found in history; but they have no name in the book of life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From a comparison of the dates given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-15.htm">1 Kings 16:15</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-23.htm">1 Kings 16:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-29.htm">1 Kings 16:29</a> it follows that the contest between the two pretenders lasted four years.<p>Tibni's death can scarcely be supposed to have been natural. Either he must have been slain in battle against Omri, or have fallen into his hands and been put to death.<p>There has probably been some derangement of the text here. The passage may have run thus: "So Tibni died, and Omri reigned in the thirty-first year of Asa, king of Judah. Omri reigned over Israel twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah." Omri's reign of 12 years began in Asa's 27th <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-15.htm">1 Kings 16:15-16</a>, and terminated in his 38th <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-29.htm">1 Kings 16:29</a>. The event belonging to Asa's 31st year was the death of Tibni, and the consequent extension of Omri's kingdom.<p>The six years in Tirzah are probably made up of the four years of contention with Tibni, and two years afterward, during which enough of Samaria was built for the king to transfer his residence there. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

Now when Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the castle of the royal palace and burned the king's house over his own head, as Sardanapalus did, according to Justin (Hist. i. 3). &#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; does not mean harem (Ewald), but the high castle (from &#1488;&#1512;&#1501;, to be high); here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-25.htm">2 Kings 15:25</a>, the citadel of the royal palace, which consisted of several buildings. </body></html>
