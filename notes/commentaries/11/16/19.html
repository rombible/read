Though we do not always understand the rules by which God governs nations and individuals in his providence, we may learn useful lessons from the history before us. When tyrants succeed each other, and massacres, conspiracies, and civil wars, we may be sure the Lord has a controversy with the people for their sins; they are loudly called to repent and reform. Omri made himself infamous by his wickedness.

There must have been in Zimri’s conduct some very prominent acts to indicate adhesion to the worship of the calves; otherwise in a reign of seven days he would hardly have been coupled with Jeroboam as leading the people into sin.

Bahr thinks that he had "formerly displayed much partiality for the calf worship." But it is quite as likely that the idea in the historian's mind was that all these events were the bitter fruits of Jeroboam's misguided and impious policy, into the spirit of which, Zimri, like his predecessors, had been baptized. It is interesting to remember here the aspect these repeated revolutions and assassinations would wear to the kingdom of Judah, then enjoying quietness and prosperity under Asa. We cannot doubt for a moment that they were regarded as so many manifestations of the righteous judgment of God, and as the outcomes of that spirit of insubordination and impiety which, in their eyes, had brought about both the division of the kingdom and the schism in the church.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"According to the word of the Lord;" see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-1.htm">1 Kings 16:1</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;, with regard to all, i.e., on account of all the sins (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-7.htm">1 Kings 16:7</a>, where &#1506;&#1500; is used). &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, through their nothingnesses, i.e., their idols, by which the golden calves are meant. </body></html>
