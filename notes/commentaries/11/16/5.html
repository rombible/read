God calls Israel his people still, though wretchedly corrupted. Jehu foretells the same destruction to come upon Baasha's family, which that king had been employed to bring upon the family of Jeroboam. Those who resemble others in their sins, may expect to resemble them in the plagues they suffer, especially those who seem zealous against such sins in others as they allow in themselves. Baasha himself dies in peace, and is buried with honour. Herein plainly appears that there are punishments after death, which are most to be dreaded. Let Elah be a warning to drunkards, who know not but death may surprise them. Death easily comes upon men when they are drunk. Besides the diseases which men bring themselves into by drinking, when in that state, men are easily overcome by an enemy, and liable to bad accidents. Death comes terribly upon men in such a state, finding them in the act of sin, and unfitted for any act of devotion; that day comes upon them unawares. The word of God was fulfilled, and the sins of Baasha and Elah were reckoned for, with which they provoked God. Their idols are called their vanities, for idols cannot profit nor help; miserable are those whose gods are vanities.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The "might" of Baasha is sufficiently indicated by those successes which drove Asa to call Ben-hadad to his aid. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-17.htm">1 Kings 15:17-21</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

The words of Jehu concerning Baasha (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-1.htm">1 Kings 16:1-4</a>) coincide exactly mutatis mutandis with the words of Ahijah concerning Jeroboam.<p>(Note: "There was something very strange in the perversity and stolidity of the kings of Israel, that when they saw that the families of preceding kings were evidently overthrown by the command of God on account of the worship of the calves, and they themselves had overturned them, they nevertheless worshipped the same calves, and placed them before the people for them to worship, that they might not return to the temple and to Asa, king of Jerusalem; though prophets denounced it and threatened their destruction. Truly the devil and the ambition of reigning blinded them and deprived them of their senses. Hence it came to pass, through the just judgment of God, that they all were executioners of one another in turn: Baasha was the executioner of the sons of Jeroboam; Zambri was the executioner of the sons of Baasha; and the executioner of Zambri was Omri." - _C. a Lapide.)<p>The expression "exalted thee out of the dust," instead of "from among the people" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-7.htm">1 Kings 14:7</a>), leads to the conjecture that Baasha had risen to be king from a very low position. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493; (his might) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-5.htm">1 Kings 16:5</a> refers, as in the case of Asa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-23.htm">1 Kings 15:23</a>), less to brave warlike deeds, than generally to the manifestation of strength and energy in his government. </body></html>
