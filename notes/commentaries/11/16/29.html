For <span class="ital">he did evil above all that were before him — </span>He exceeded all his predecessors in wickedness, and <span class="ital">reigned over Israel twenty-two years — </span>Long enough to do a deal of mischief. He had seen the ruin of other wicked kings and their families; yet, instead of taking warning, his heart was hardened and enraged against God. <span class="ital">As if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam — </span>To break the second commandment, by worshipping God through the medium of images of Jeroboam’s invention; as if that sin had not been heinous enough to express his contempt of God; as if he thought it below his genius and dignity to content himself with so vulgar a fault; he would set aside the first commandment too, by avowedly introducing other gods, the gods of his heathenish and idolatrous wife Jezebel. But the Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">ויהי הנקל</span>, <span class="ital">vajehi hanakel, </span>is more properly rendered, <span class="ital">was it a light thing, </span>&c., that is, was this but a small sin, that therefore he needed to add more abominations? the question, as is usual among the Hebrews, implying a strong denial, and intimating that this was no small sin, but a great crime, and might have satisfied his wicked mind, without any additions. <span class="ital">He took to wife Jezebel — </span>A woman infamous for her idolatries, cruelties, sorceries, and abominations of all kinds. <span class="ital">The daughter of Ethbaal — </span>Called <span class="ital">Ithobalus, </span>or <span class="ital">Itobalus </span>in heathen writers. So she was of a heathenish and idolatrous race, such as the kings and people of Israel were expressly forbidden to marry. <span class="ital">And went and served Baal — </span>The idol which the Sidonians worshipped, which some think to have been Hercules. But the word in Hebrew signifies <span class="ital">lord, </span>and in the plural <span class="ital">lords, </span>and was a name common to all false gods. And this idolatry was much worse than that of the calves; because in the calves they intended to worship the true God, through such images and representations, but in these, false gods or devils.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:29-34 Ahab did evil above all that reigned before him, and did it with a particular enmity both against Jehovah and Israel. He was not satisfied with breaking the second commandment by image-worship, he broke the first by worshipping other gods: making light of lesser sins makes way for greater. Marriages with daring offenders also imbolden in wickedness, and hurry men on to the greatest excesses. One of Ahab's subjects, following the example of his presumption, ventured to build Jericho. Like Achan, he meddled with the accursed thing; turned that to his own use, which was devoted to God's honour: he began to build, in defiance of the curse well devoted to God's honour: he began to build, in defiance of the curse well known in Israel; but none ever hardened his heart against God, and prospered. Let the reading of this chapter cause us to mark the dreadful end of all the workers of iniquity. And what does the history of all ungodly men furnish, what ever rank or situation they move in, but sad examples of the same?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Twenty and two years - Rather, from a comparison between <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-10.htm">1 Kings 15:10</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-51.htm">1 Kings 22:51</a>, not more than 21 years.

Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him&#8212;The worship of God by symbols had hitherto been the offensive form of apostasy in Israel, but now gross idolatry is openly patronized by the court. This was done through the influence of Jezebel, Ahab's queen. She was "the daughter of Eth-baal, king of the Zidonians." He was priest of Ashtaroth or Astarte, who, having murdered Philetes, king of Tyre, ascended the throne of that kingdom, being the eighth king since Hiram. Jezebel was the wicked daughter of this regicide and idol priest&#8212;and, on her marriage with Ahab, never rested till she had got all the forms of her native Tyrian worship introduced into her adopted country.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And in the thirty fifth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel,....
