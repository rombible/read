And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.">2Chronicles 12:15</a>, it would seem that, while Ahijah belonged to Shiloh in Ephraim, and continued to dwell there, Shemaiah was rather attached to Judah, and hence, that his interference to protect the new kingdom was the more striking and unexpected. In this interposition, to which probably the very preservation of Jeroboam’s half-formed kingdom was due, there is a fresh indication of the great opportunity given to that kingdom to maintain itself, under the blessing of God and in devotion to His service. The phrase “your brethren, the children of Israel,” marks this with much emphasis.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/12-22.htm" title="But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,...">1 Kings 12:22-24</a></span>. <span class="ital">The word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God </span>— The prophet so called, partly to distinguish him from others of that name, (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-10.htm" title="Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay you; yes, in the night will they come to slay you.">Nehemiah 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-31.htm" title="Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus said the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie:">Jeremiah 29:31</a>,) and partly to add more weight to his words. It appears this prophet was very well known in the reign of Rehoboam, whose annals he is supposed to have written. Of what authority he was in Judah, we may learn from this passage, in which he is represented as prevailing with the king, and a hundred and fourscore thousand men, to lay down their arms, and return home, instead of proceeding to make war on their brethren as they had intended, merely by declaring that the division which had happened was by the order and appointment of God. — Calmet. <span class="ital">This thing is from me </span>— This event is from my counsel and providence, to punish Solomon’s apostacy. <span class="ital">They hearkened therefore to the word of the Lord </span>— Either from a conscientious regard to their duty, or because they durst not oppose so potent an adversary.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:16-24 The people speak unbecomingly of David.

These considerations should reconcile us to our losses and troubles, that God is the Author of them, and our brethren the instruments: let us not meditate revenge. Rehoboam and his people hearkened to the word of the Lord. When we know God's mind, we must submit, how much soever it crosses our own mind.

Rehoboam determined to assert his authority by leading a large force into the disaffected provinces. But the revolt of the ten tribes was completed when the prophet Shemaiah ordered, in the Lord's name, an abandonment of any hostile measures against the revolutionists. The army, overawed by the divine prohibition, dispersed, and the king was obliged to submit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The man of God, </span> i.e. the prophet, so called, partly to distinguish him from others of that name; see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-10.htm" title="Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay you; yes, in the night will they come to slay you.">Nehemiah 6:10</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-31.htm" title="Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus said the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie:">Jeremiah 29:31</a></span>; and partly to add the more weight to his words. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God,....

Sometimes it is said ‘the Lord sent’ (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-1.htm" title="And the LORD sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.">2 Samuel 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-25.htm" title="And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.">2 Samuel 12:25</a>). The prompting by a vision in sleep is most frequently recorded, and this we may assume in other cases to have been the way in which God’s message came.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Shemaiah</span>] Beside the present notice of him, Shemaiah is also mentioned at the time when Shishak, king of Egypt, invaded Judæa and besieged Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-5.htm" title="Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, Thus said the LORD, You have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.">2 Chronicles 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-7.htm" title="And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.">2 Chronicles 12:7</a>). He then was sent with a message of comfort to the princes of Judah.

When Keil describes him as "a prophet who is not mentioned again," he has surely overlooked <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-7.htm">2 Chronicles 12:7, 8</a>, where we find him prophesying with reference to the army of Shishak], <span class="cmt_word">the man of God</span> [a common expression in the books of Kings. It rarely occurs in the other Scriptures. This designation is not altogether synonymous with "prophet." It is used, for example, of <span class="accented">angels</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-6.htm">Judges 13:6, 8</a>), of <span class="accented">Moses</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-1.htm">Deuteronomy 33:1</a>), and of <span class="accented">David</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-14.htm">2 Chronicles 8:14</a>), and would embrace <span class="accented">any</span> minister or servant of God, while <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span> is restricted to the teaching order. There were <span class="accented">false</span> prophets, but no false men of God. It is also worth considering whether the name of prophet may not have been practically restricted to, or bestowed by preference on, those who had received a prophetic training, the "sons of the prophets" who had been taught in the schools. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-20.htm">1 Samuel 19:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-14.htm">Amos 7:14</a>], <span class="cmt_word">saying</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The harsh word supplied the discontented with an apparently just occasion for saying, "What portion have we in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse! To thy tents, O Israel! Now see to thy house, David!" i.e., take care of thy house. David, the tribe-father, is mentioned in the place of his family. These words, with which Sheba had once preached rebellion in the time of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-1.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a>), give expression to the deep-rooted aversion which was cherished by these tribes towards the Davidic monarchy, and that in so distinct and unvarnished a manner, that we may clearly see that there were deeper causes for the secession than the pretended oppression of Solomon's government; that its real foundation was the ancient jealousy of the tribes, which had been only suppressed for the time by David and Solomon, but had not been entirely eradicated, whilst this jealousy again had its roots in the estrangement of these tribes from the Lord, and from His law and righteousness.</body></html>
