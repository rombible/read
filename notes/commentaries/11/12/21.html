How soon are good men, and their good services to the public, forgotten ! These considerations should reconcile us to our losses and troubles, that God is the Author of them, and our brethren the instruments: let us not meditate revenge. Rehoboam and his people hearkened to the word of the Lord. When we know God's mind, we must submit, how much soever it crosses our own mind.

By blood Benjamin was far more closely connected with Ephraim than with Judah. All the traditions of Benjamin were antagonistic to Judah, and hitherto the weak tribe had been accustomed to lean constantly on its strong northern neighhour. But it would seem that, in the half-century which had elapsed since the revolt of Sheba, the son of Bichri <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-1.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a>, the feelings of the Benjamites had undergone a complete change. This is best accounted for by the establishment of the religious and political capital at Jerusalem, on the border line of the two tribes <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-16.htm">Joshua 18:16</a>, from where it resulted that the new metropolis stood partly within the territory of either, and was in a certain sense common to both. One of the gates of Jerusalem was "the high gate of Benjamin" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>; and probably Benjamites formed a considerable part of the population. The whole tribe also, we may well believe, was sincerely attached to the temple worship, in which they could participate far more freely and more constantly than the members of remoter tribes, and to which the habits of forty years had now accustomed them.<p>On the number of the Israelites, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>, notes; and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-9.htm">2 Samuel 24:9</a>, notes. The number mentioned here is moderate, compared with the numbers given both previously and subsequently <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-3.htm">2 Chronicles 13:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-14.htm">2 Chronicles 17:14-18</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ki 12:20-33.

Rehoboam determined to assert his authority by leading a large force into the disaffected provinces. But the revolt of the ten tribes was completed when the prophet Shemaiah ordered, in the Lord's name, an abandonment of any hostile measures against the revolutionists. The army, overawed by the divine prohibition, dispersed, and the king was obliged to submit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">With the tribe of Benjamin, </span> i.e. that part of it which was next to Judah, and joined with them. <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-13.htm" title="However, I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe to your son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.">1 Kings 11:13</a>"</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Against the house of Israel, </span> i.e. the families or tribes (for these words are promiscuously used one for the other) of Israel. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem,  From Shechem, which was forty miles (n) from Jerusalem: <p>he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon; which not only shows courage reassumed by Rehoboam, now safely home, but the hearty attachment of Judah and Benjamin to him, who raised presently so numerous an army in his favour; and had it not been that the Lord was against their going to battle with Israel, in all probability they might have gained their point, Jeroboam being scarcely settled in his kingdom, and having no forces raised. <p>(n) Reland.

That a sort of jealousy existed at one time between the tribes of Benjamin and Judah, consequent, no doubt, on the transference of the sceptre from the house of Saul to that of David, <span class="cmt_word">is</span> very evident. A thousand men of Benjamin constituted the following of the rebel Shimei, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-17.htm">2 Samuel 19:17</a>). The rising of Sheba the Benjamite, again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-1.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a>), proves that the enmity and discontent were not even then subdued. But when the ten tribes fell away, Benjamin seems never to have faltered in its allegiance. The change is easily accounted for. It was the glory of Benjamin that Jerusalem, the joy of the whole earth, the civil and religious capital of the nation, was largely within its border. "The city of the Jebusite" was in the lot of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>). But it was also on the boundary line of Judah. This fact had, no doubt, brought the two tribes into close contact, and had given them interests in common, in fact had "riveted them together as by a cramp" (Blunt, pp. 167, 174, who traces "a gradual tendency of the ten tribes to become confederate under Ephraim," and a growing alliance and community of interests between Judah and Benjamin); and now Benjamin could not fail to see that separation from Judah would mean the loss of Jerusalem (which would be largely peopled by the men of Judah, David's tribe, and would be practically in their hands), while adhesion to Ephraim would not prevent the establishment of another sanctuary further north. The traditions of fifty years, consequently, and the common interest in the capital, prevailed over hereditary ties and ancient feuds, and decided Benjamin to cast in its lot with Judah;the more so, as the heads of this tribe may have felt, after once furnishing Israel with its king, as jealous of Ephraim as they had once been of Judah. It must not be forgotten, however, that some portions of Benjamin, including Bethel, Gilgal, and Jericho, were incorporated in the northern kingdom (Ewald) ], <span class="cmt_word">an hundred and fourscore thousand</span> <span class="cmt_word">chosen men</span> [the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x1f76;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>  =  120,000, but the larger number need create no astonishment. At the time of David's census, the men of Judah numbered - if the figures can be depended on - 500,000, while Abijah could muster some 18 years afterwards an army of 400,000 (2 Chronicles 1 [lit., <span class="accented">making war</span>]<span class="accented">,<span class="cmt_word"></span> to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon.</span> [It is characteristic of Rehoboam that he proposes forthwith to subdue the rebellious tribes by force.
