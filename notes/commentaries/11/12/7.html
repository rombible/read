For the advice of the old counsellors has no largeness of policy or depth of wisdom. It is simply the characteristic advice of experienced and crafty politicians—who had seen the gradual development of despotic power, and had still remembrance of the comparative freedom of earlier days—understanding at once the dangerous vehemence of popular excitement, and the facility with which it may be satisfied by temporary concessions, and perhaps desiring to defeat that private ambition, which was making use for its own purposes of the natural sense of grievance. It is to give “good words,” and to be for the moment “a servant to the people,” with, perhaps, the intention of abolishing certain excessive grievances, but by no means of yielding up substantial power. Whether it was in itself more than superficially prudent, would depend on the seriousness of the grievances, and the social and political condition of the people.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:1-15 The tribes complained not to Rehoboam of his father's idolatry, and revolt from God. That which was the greatest grievance, was none to them; so careless were they in matters of religion, if they might live at case, and pay no taxes. Factious spirits will never want something to complain of. And when we see the Scripture account of Solomon's reign; the peace, wealth, and prosperity Israel then enjoyed; we cannot doubt but that their charges were false, or far beyond the truth. Rehoboam answered the people according to the counsel of the young men. Never was man more blinded by pride, and desire of arbitrary power, than which nothing is more fatal. God's counsels were hereby fulfilled. He left Rehoboam to his own folly, and hid from his eyes the things which belonged to his peace, that the kingdom might be rent from him. God serves his own wise and righteous purposes by the imprudences and sins of men. Those that lose the kingdom of heaven, throw it away, as Rehoboam, by wilfulness and folly.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The advice was not that the king should permanently resign the office of ruler, but that he should "for once" be ruled by his people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-8. he said &#8230; Depart yet for three days&#8212;It was prudent to take the people's demand into calm and deliberate consideration. Whether, had the advice of the sage and experienced counsellors been followed, any good result would have followed, it is impossible to say. It would at least have removed all pretext for the separation.

He says, "The king could not become the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span> of the people without prejudicing the authority entrusted to him by God." But they do not propose that he should become their servant, except for one clay, and then only in the sense of making reasonable concessions. What they mean is this: "If thou wilt brook for once to accede to their terms instead of dictating thine own," etc. The form of their answer was probably suggested by the temper of the king. They saw what was passing in his mind, viz., that he would fain play the autocrat, and that he resented it exceedingly that his subjects, just as he had begun to taste the sweets of royalty, should presume to parley with him; and they say in effect, "You think that they are reversing your relations, that they are making you, their sovereign, their servant. Be it so. It is but for one day.

Rehoboam went to Shechem, because all Israel had come thither to make him king. "All Israel," according to what follows (cf., <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-20.htm">1 Kings 12:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-21.htm">1 Kings 12:21</a>), was the ten tribes beside Judah and Benjamin. The right of making king the prince whom God had chosen, i.e., of anointing him and doing homage to him (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">1 Chronicles 12:38</a>, where &#1492;&#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; alternates with &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;,   (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>), was an old traditional right in Israel, and the tribes had exercised it not only in the case of Saul and David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-15.htm">1 Samuel 11:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>), but in that of Solomon also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-22.htm">1 Chronicles 29:22</a>). The ten tribes of Israel made use of this right on Rehoboam's ascent of the throne; but instead of coming to Jerusalem, the residence of the king and capital of the kingdom, as they ought to have done, and doing homage there to the legitimate successor of Solomon, they had gone to Sichem, the present Nabulus (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-18.htm">Genesis 33:18</a>), the place where the ancient national gatherings were held in the tribe of Ephraim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1</a>), and where Abimelech the son of Gideon had offered himself as king in the time of the Judges (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-1.htm">Judges 9:1</a>.). On the choice of Sichem as the place for doing homage Kimchi has quite correctly observed, that "they sought an opportunity for transferring the government to Jeroboam, and therefore were unwilling to come to Jerusalem, but came to Sichem, which belonged to Ephraim, whilst Jeroboam was an Ephraimite." If there could be any further doubt on the matter, it would be removed by the fact that they had sent for Jeroboam the son of Nebat to come from Egypt, whither he had fled from Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-40.htm">1 Kings 11:40</a>), and attend this meeting, and that Jeroboam took the lead in the meeting, and no doubt suggested to those assembled the demand which they should lay before Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>).<p>(Note: "This pretext was no doubt furnished to the people by Jeroboam, who, because he had formerly been placed above Ephraim as superintendent of the works, could most craftily suggest calumnies, from the things which he knew better than others." - (Seb. Schmidt.)</body></html>
