It is hardly likely that the king would have lacked because at Dan an unauthorised Levitical priesthood was (as has been said) forthcoming.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-31.htm" title="And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.">1 Kings 12:31</a></span>. <span class="ital">And he made a house of high places — </span>That is, saith Abarbinel, he made a house or temple at Dan, wherein there was not one altar only, as there was at Jerusalem, but a great many altars or high places, probably complaining of it as an inconvenience, that in the temple at Jerusalem there was but one. The multiplying of altars passed with some as a piece of devotion; but God, by the prophet, puts another construction upon it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-11.htm" title="Because Ephraim has made many altars to sin, altars shall be to him to sin.">Hosea 8:11</a>, <span class="ital">Ephraim has made many altars to sin.

But it must be observed here, that the words <span class="greekheb">מקצות העם</span>, <span class="ital">meketsoth hagnam, </span>properly signify, <span class="ital">from the ends of the people, </span>and may be rendered, <span class="ital">out of all the people, </span>that is, promiscuously out of every tribe: an exposition which Bochart hath justified by a great many examples, showing that the same words are used in this sense in divers other places. Indeed, this exposition seems to be confirmed by the following clause, added to explain these words, <span class="ital">which were not of the sons of Levi —</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Though they were not of the tribe of Levi, to whom the office of the priesthood was confined by God’s express command. So that Jeroboam’s sin, as to this particular, was not that he chose mean persons, for many of the Levites were such; and his sin would not have been the less if he had chosen the noblest and greatest persons; as we see in the example of Uzziah: but in that he chose men of other tribes, contrary to God’s appointment, which restrained that office to that tribe. Thus, as he transferred the kingdom from the house of David, so he transferred the priesthood from the family of Aaron; and left it open, that any body might be admitted to that honourable employment; which was a very popular thing, and ingratiated him, no doubt, with the people.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:25-33 Jeroboam distrusted the providence of God; he would contrive ways and means, and sinful ones too, for his own safety. A practical disbelief of God's all-sufficiency is at the bottom of all our departures from him. Though it is probable he meant his worship for Jehovah the God of Israel, it was contrary to the Divine law, and dishonourable to the Divine majesty to be thus represented. The people might be less shocked at worshipping the God of Israel under an image, than if they had at once been asked to worship Baal; but it made way for that idolatry. Blessed Lord, give us grace to reverence thy temple, thine ordinances, thine house of prayer, thy sabbaths, and never more, like Jeroboam, to set up in our hearts any idol of abomination. Be thou to us every thing precious; do thou reign and rule in our hearts, the hope of glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He made an house of high places - i. e., "He built a temple, or sanctuary, at each of the two cities where the calves were set up."

That the Levites did not accept Jeroboam's innovations, and transfer their services to his two sanctuaries, must have been the consequence of their faithful attachment to the true worship of Yahweh.

The noun properly means ‘an end’, ‘an extremity.’ Then in the plural, as it is here, ‘the extremities,’ which between them comprise the whole space of anything. Thus the word is rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-2.htm" title="And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said to them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.">Jdg 18:2</a> (R.V.) ‘five men <span class="ital">from their whole number</span>.’ Here the idea is that Jeroboam’s priests were taken from anywhere, and so the selection differed much from that of the southern kingdom, where one tribe alone held the priest’s office. The Levites who before the division of the kingdom had been scattered among all the tribes, now, in the main, withdrew to the southern tribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/11-13.htm" title="And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts....">2 Chronicles 11:13-14</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he made an house of high places</span> [See on 1 Kings 3:2, and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-29.htm">2 Kings 17:29</a>. It is often assumed (Keil, Rawlinson, <span class="accented">al.</span> after Josephus) that Jeroboam built <span class="accented">two</span> temples for his cherubim, and the statement of the text, that he built one, is explained on the ground that the historian contrasts the "house of high places" with the "house of the Lord." Ewald, too, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-29.htm">2 Kings 17:29, 32</a>, understands the words as <span class="accented">plural</span>. But is it not more probable that a chapel or sanctuary already existed at Dan, where an irregular priesthood had ministered for more than four hundred years? This verse would then refer exclusively to Jeroboam's procedure at <span class="accented">Bethel</span> (see next verse). There he built a temple and ordained a number of priests, but Dan had both already. We know that the Danite priests carried on the calf worship to the time of the captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30</a>). This "house of high places" has grown in Ewald's pages into "a splendid temple in Canaanite style"], <span class="cmt_word">and made priests of the lowest of the people</span> [Heb. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> "<span class="accented">from the ends</span>," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, from all classes, <span class="accented">ex</span> <span class="accented">universe populo</span> (Gesen.), and not, as the writer explains presently, from the tribe of Levi alone. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-4.htm">Genesis 19:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-20.htm">Judges 18:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-2.htm">Ezekiel 33:2</a>, prove this to be the correct interpretation of the word. Rawlinson, who remarks that "Jeroboam could have no motive for specially selecting persons of low condition," does not thereby dispose of the A.V. rendering, for the historian might mean that <span class="accented">some</span> of Jeroboam's priests were of the lowest stamp, because he could find no others, or because he was so little scrupulous as to take them.

The statement of ver. 14, that, "Jeroboam and his sons" had "cast them out," suggests that they had refused to take part in his new cult and that thereupon he banished them, and, no doubt, confiscated their possessions.

Sichem, a place well known from the time of Abraham downwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>), was situated upon the mountains of Ephraim, between Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, and still exists under the name of Nabulus or Nabls, a name corrupted from Flavia Neapolis. Jeroboam dwelt therein, i.e., he chose it at first as his residence, though he afterwards resided in Thirza (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-17.htm">1 Kings 14:17</a>). Pnuel was situated, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-31.htm">Genesis 32:31</a>, on the other side of the Jordan, on the northern bank of the Jabbok (not the southern side, as Thenius supposes); and judging from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-22.htm">Genesis 32:22</a>. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-8.htm">Judges 8:8</a>., it was on the caravan road, which led through Gilead to Damascus, and thence past Palmyra and along the Euphrates to Mesopotamia. It was probably on account of its situation that Jeroboam fortified it, to defend his sovereignty over Gilead against hostile attacks from the north-east and east.</body></html>
