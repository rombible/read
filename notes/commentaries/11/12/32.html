The fixing of Jeroboam’s festival of dedication for the Temple at Bethel to this special day is characteristic. It at once challenged likeness to the Feast of Tabernacles, which was (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-2.htm" title="And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.">1Kings 8:2</a>) the occasion of Solomon’s dedication at Jerusalem, and yet took liberty to alter the date, and fix it in the month “which he had devised of his own heart,” thus assuming the right to set aside the letter of the old law, while professing still to observe the worship of Jehovah.<p><span class= "bld">Offered</span>—or (see margin) <span class= "ital">went up</span>—upon the altar.—The expression seems to imply that he ventured on a still greater innovation by taking on himself both functions of the priestly office—to offer sacrifice and (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-33.htm" title="So he offered on the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast to the children of Israel: and he offered on the altar, and burnt incense.">1Kings 12:33</a>) to burn incense. This is not, indeed, necessarily implied; for (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-63.htm" title="And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.">1Kings 8:63</a>) the sacrificer is often said to offer, when he evidently does so only through the priests. But Jeroboam had set aside the peculiar sanctity of the Levitical priesthood already; and so was very naturally prepared to crown this process by acting as head of the unauthorised priesthood which he had created. Perhaps he had witnessed the exclusive prominence of Solomon at the great dedication festival, and desired to imitate and outdo it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-32.htm" title="And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like to the feast that is in Judah, and he offered on the altar.

His chief intention in this change, no doubt, was to alienate the people from the rites observed at Jerusalem. “Some suppose, with Mr. Locke, that as this feast was appointed by God to be observed after the gathering in of the fruits, which might be sooner ripe about Jerusalem than in the northern parts of the country; so Jeroboam might pretend that the eighth month would be a better time for it than the seventh, because then they would everywhere be gathered.” Add to this, he might possibly have two other reasons for making this alteration: 1st, Lest he should seem directly to oppose the God of Israel, who had in a special manner commanded all the people to go up to Jerusalem on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, if he should require their attendance to celebrate the feast elsewhere at the same time: and, 2d, That by appointing his feast to be kept a month after that at Jerusalem was past, he might give those of the people of Judah an opportunity of attending it, whose curiosity might lead them so to do; and thereby might ensure the presence of a greater concourse of people to honour his institution. <span class="ital">On the fifteenth day — </span>And so forward till the seven days were ended. <span class="ital">Like that in Judah — </span>From whence he took his pattern, to show that he worshipped the same God, and professed the same religion, for substance, which they did, however he differed in circumstances. <span class="ital">He offered upon the altar — </span>With his own hands, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/13-1.htm" title="And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD to Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense....">1 Kings 13:1-4</a>, which he did to give the more countenance to his newly-devised solemnity.

A practical disbelief of God's all-sufficiency is at the bottom of all our departures from him. Though it is probable he meant his worship for Jehovah the God of Israel, it was contrary to the Divine law, and dishonourable to the Divine majesty to be thus represented. The people might be less shocked at worshipping the God of Israel under an image, than if they had at once been asked to worship Baal; but it made way for that idolatry. Blessed Lord, give us grace to reverence thy temple, thine ordinances, thine house of prayer, thy sabbaths, and never more, like Jeroboam, to set up in our hearts any idol of abomination.

It may also have assumed the character of a feast of dedication, held at the same time, after the example of Solomon <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-2.htm">1 Kings 8:2</a>. His object in changing the month from the seventh to the eighth, and yet keeping the day of the month, is not clear. Perhaps it was on account of the later vintage of the more northern regions. It is remarkable that Josephus places the scene in the "seventh" month. He therefore, was not aware that the people of Israel kept the feast of tabernacles a month later than their brethren of Judah. The expression "he offered upon the altar" (see the margin and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-26.htm">Exodus 20:26</a>) shows that Jeroboam himself officiated as priest, and offered this sacrifice - at Bethel, not at Dan; where it is possible that the priests descended from Jonathan, the son of Gershom and grandson of Moses, undertook the services (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30</a> note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>31. made priests of the lowest of the people&#8212;literally, "out of all the people," the Levites refusing to act. He himself assumed to himself the functions of the high priest, at least, at the great festival, probably from seeing the king of Egypt conjoin the royal and sacred offices, and deeming the office of the high priest too great to be vested in a subject.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Nor is this strange; for he might plausibly think, that he who by his own authority had made others priests, might much more exercise a part of that office; at least, upon an extraordinary occasion; in which case he knew David himself had done some things, which otherwise he might not do. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">So did he in Beth-el, </span> i.e. he himself did offer there in like manner, as he now had done at Dan. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Unto the calves; </span> for they were two, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-29.htm" title="And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.">1 Kings 12:29</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He placed in Beth-el the priests; </span> as he had done at Dan, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-31.htm" title="And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.">1 Kings 12:31</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah,.... The feast of tabernacles, which was on the fifteenth day of the seventh month; this was done chiefly for the sake of an alteration; though Abarbinel thinks, because the fruits of the land were not so soon ripe nor so soon gathered, in the northern parts of the land, as nearer Jerusalem, he judged this month the fittest for the feast of ingathering the fruits; and he might hope to get more people to come to his feast, when all were gathered in: <p>and he offered upon the altar (so he did in Bethel), sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: this he did by his priests, or rather he himself did it, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-4.htm">1 Kings 13:4</a>, this shows that Jeroboam made these calves for worship, and did sacrifice to them, at least as representations of God. Abarbinel, to make this agree with his hypothesis, gives this sense of the clause, that he did not sacrifice to the calves, but to God, because of them, that his kingdom, which they were a sign of, might be continued; and there being but one calf in a place, he could not be said to sacrifice to them both, but to God, because of both; or else he thinks this must be done after the people had turned aside to them, and not when Jeroboam made them. The clause in the parenthesis, "so he did in Bethel", intimates that he did the same in Bethel as in Dan, of which what is said before is spoken; that is, that he made an house of high places in Bethel also, made priests out of all the people, such as were not of the tribe of Levi, appointed the feast of the fifteenth day of the eighth month to be observed there also, and he himself offered on the altar there: <p>and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made: to officiate there. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that <i>is</i> in Judah, and he offered upon the altar.

Jeroboam came as near as he could but chose a later month, perhaps induced to do so because the harvest-celebration kept at the Feast of Tabernacles could be very well placed later in the northern part of the land. Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant</span>. VIII. 8. <span class="ital">5</span>) says, contrary to all other authorities, that Jeroboam’s feast was in the <span class="ital">seventh</span> month.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and he offered upon the altar</span>] The verb sometimes means ‘to go up unto,’ and this is represented on the margin of A.

The more distant Dan perhaps was inaugurated by some of the newly-made priests. Thus Jeroboam in some degree imitated Solomon’s dedication of the Temple.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the Feast of Tabernacles, which was held on the 15th of the <span class="accented">seventh</span> month (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-2.htm">1 Kings 8:2</a>). This was the great feast of the year, and, as the feast of harvest or ingathering, the most joyous. See on 1 Kings 8:1. Had Jeroboam provided no counter attraction to this great festive gathering in Judah he might have found it a formidable temptation to his subjects. The reason usually given for the alteration of the time - in defiance of the law, which expressly fixed it in the seventh month (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34, 39, 41</a>) - is that the eighth would be more generally convenient in the north, where the harvest or vintage was a month later (Then., Keil), as affording more time for the ingathering. In favour of this view is the consideration that the Jews not unfrequently had to intercalate a month - a second Adar - into their year, because of the season being a late one. Some of the older commentators, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>., Vatab., think this time was chosen as the anniversary of his secession, but this is pure conjecture, and such an association would be contrary to the genius of the Hebrew people. Keil maintains that Jeroboam's design was to "make the separation, in a religious point of view, as complete as possible." But we can hardly be expected to believe that he altered the <span class="accented">month</span>, for the sake of creating a distinction, but "retained the <span class="accented">day</span> of the month, the fifteenth, for the sake of the weak who took offence at his innovations" (Keil). The day was retained, as Bahr points out, because, the months being lunar, the fifteenth was the day of the full moon], <span class="cmt_word">and he offered</span> [Heb. as marg., "<span class="accented">and he went up</span>," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, ascended the altar; LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span>. (Keil contends that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> means "and he sacrificed," but this translation is without precedent. Ver. 33, "and he went up <span class="accented">to</span> <span class="accented">burn incense</span> is decisive as to the meaning.) the altar was always raised. It was probably approached by s slope, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-26.htm">Exodus 20:26</a> forbade steps, though it is by no means certain that they were not used even in Solomon's temple, and Jeroboam probably would have no scruples on such a minute point of ritual. It has been thought (Kitto, 4:147) that he was moved to officiate in person by the precedent of the Egyptian kings, who exercised priestly functions; but it is much more probable that he was guided by the example of Solomon at the dedication of the temple] <span class="cmt_word">upon</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, he stood upon the ledge or platform (called in the A.V. "compass," <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-5.htm">Exodus 27:5</a>) in the middle of the altar] <span class="cmt_word">the altar. So did he in Bethel</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the feast was held at one centre only, and at Bethel alone the king offered in person. But I venture to suggest that instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>, "so did he," etc., we should read <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. The LXX. seem to have had this word before them - <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;</span>. And not only does this slight change bring the Hebrew into harmony with the LXX., but it also simplifies the construction. "He went up upon the altar which he made to sacrifice unto the calves which he made." The very tautology is instructive, as suggesting that altar, calves, and priests were all of Jeroboam's making, not of God's ordaining. The use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5d9;</span> as a relative (  =   <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>) is strictly grammatical], <span class="cmt_word">sacrificing</span> [marg., to <span class="accented">sacrifice</span>] <span class="cmt_word">unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel</span> [Dan being already provided with its priesthood] <span class="cmt_word">the priests of the high places</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of "the house of high places" (ver. 31).

"If this people go up to perform sacrifice in the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, their heart will turn to their lord, king Rehoboam," etc.</body></html>
