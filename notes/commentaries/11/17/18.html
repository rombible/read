For it is the adoption of the regular Israelitish description of the prophet as her own. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-6.htm" title="Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not from where he was, neither told he me his name:">Judges 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-22.htm" title="But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,">1Kings 12:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-1.htm" title="And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD to Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.">1Kings 13:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">To call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?</span>—The words express the unreasonableness of natural sorrow. The underlying idea is that of the exclamation, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.” The better knowledge of God, gained through the presence of the prophet, had, of course, brought out in her a deeper sense of sin, and now makes her feel that her sorrow is a just punishment. With pathetic confusion of idea, she cries out against his presence, as if it were the actual cause of judgment on the sin, which it has simply brought home to her conscience.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-18.htm" title="And she said to Elijah, What have I to do with you, O you man of God? are you come to me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?">1 Kings 17:18</a></span>. <span class="ital">She said, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? — </span>Wherein have I injured or offended thee, or been wanting in my duty?

The child being dead, the mother spake to the prophet, rather to give vent to her sorrow, than in hope of relief. When God removes our comforts from us, he remembers our sins against us, perhaps the sins of our youth, though long since past. When God remembers our sins against us, he designs to teach us to remember them against ourselves, and to repent of them. Elijah's prayer was doubtless directed by the Holy Spirit. The child revived.

Without answering her bitter upbraiding, the prophet takes the child, lays it on his bed, and after a very earnest prayer, had the happiness of seeing its restoration, and along with it, gladness to the widow's heart and home. The prophet was sent to this widow, not merely for his own security, but on account of her faith, to strengthen and promote which he was directed to go to her rather than to many widows in Israel, who would have eagerly received him on the same privileged terms of exception from the grinding famine. The relief of her bodily necessities became the preparatory means of supplying her spiritual wants, and bringing her and her son, through the teachings of the prophet, to a clear knowledge of God, and a firm faith in His word (Lu 4:25).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">What have I to do with thee?</span> wherein have I injured or provoked thee? or, why didst thou come to sojourn in my house, (as the following words seem to explain these,) if this be the fruit of it?

As if she should say, it would have been well for me if I had never seen thy face, or had any conversation with thee; this she said rashly, and in her passion and agony, being extremely affected with the death of her child, which made her forget and overlook all the benefits she had received through the prophet's being with her: <p>art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son? to punish her for her former sins, she was conscious she had been guilty of; for she supposed, that as it was by his prayer that the drought and famine were come upon the land, so it was in the same way that her son's death came, namely, through the prayer of the prophet. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_kings/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">What have I to do with thee?</span>] Used by persons who wish him whom they address to depart from them.

The man of God has been sojourning with her, and hence God’s attention, in her idea, has been more directed to her than it would otherwise have been. Her sin in this way has been brought to His remembrance, and so He has taken the life of her son as a punishment.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">what to me</span> and thee.

To discover whether it was to her that the Lord had sent him, he asked her for something to drink and for a morsel of bread to eat; whereupon she assured him, with an oath by Jehovah, that she had nothing baked (&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1490;  equals  &#1506;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, a cake baked in hot ashes), but only a handful of meal in the &#1499;&#1468;&#1491; (a pail or small vessel in which meal was kept) and a little oil in the pitcher, and that she was just gathering wood to dress this remnant for herself and her son, that they might eat it, and then die. From this statement of the widow it is evident, on the one hand, that the drought and famine had spread across the Phoenician frontier, as indeed Menander of Ephesus attests;<p>(Note: Josephus gives this statement from his Phoenician history: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (sc., &#x399;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;) &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3a5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3a5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (Ant. viii. 13, 2). Hyperberetaeus answers to Tishri of the Hebrews; cf. Benfey and Stern, die Monatsnamen, p. 18.)<p>on the other hand, the widow showed by the oath, "as Jehovah thy God liveth," that she was a worshipper of the true God, who spoke of Jehovah as his God, because she recognised the prophet as an Israelite. </body></html>
