Jezebel was Elijah's greatest enemy; yet, to show her how powerless was her malice, God will find a hiding-place for him even in her own country. The person appointed to entertain Elijah is not one of the rich or great men of Sidon; but a poor widow woman, in want, and desolate, is made both able and willing to sustain him. It is God's way, and it is his glory, to make use of, and put honour upon, the weak and foolish things of the world. O woman, great was thy faith; one has not found the like, no not in Israel. She took the prophet's word, that she should not lose by it. Those who can venture upon the promise of God, will make no difficulty to expose and empty themselves in his service, by giving him his part first. Surely the increase of this widow's faith, so as to enable her thus readily to deny herself, and to depend upon the Divine promise, was as great a miracle in the kingdom of grace, as the increase of her meal and oil in the kingdom of providence. Happy are all who can thus, against hope, believe and obey in hope. One poor meal's meat this poor widow gave the prophet; in recompence of it, she and her son did eat above two years, in a time of famine. To have food from God's special favour, and in such good company as Elijah, made it more than doubly sweet. It is promised to those who trust in God, that they shall not be ashamed in evil time; in days of famine they shall be satisfied.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is the first recorded miracle of its kind - a supernatural and inexplicable multiplication of food (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-42.htm">2 Kings 4:42-44</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-15.htm">Matthew 14:15-21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-32.htm">Matthew 15:32-38</a>). The sacred record does not explain these miracles; but if the explanations sometimes suggested - that there was a transformation of previously existing matter into meal, oil, fish, and bread - be the true one, the marvel of the thing would not be much greater than that astonishing natural chemistry by which, in the growth of plants, particles of water, air, and earth are transmuted into fruits and grains of corn, and so fitted to be human food. There would be a difference in the agency employed and in the time occupied in the transmutation, but the thing done would be almost the same. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ki 17:8-16.

Meeting, at his entrance into the town, the very woman who was appointed by divine providence to support him, his faith was severely tested by learning from her that her supplies were exhausted and that she was preparing her last meal for herself and son. The Spirit of God having prompted him to ask, and her to grant, some necessary succor, she received a prophet's reward (Mt 10:41, 42), and for the one meal afforded to him, God, by a miraculous increase of the little stock, afforded many to her.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> God still creating new, as fast as the old was spent. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the Lord, which he spake by Elijah.

To discover whether it was to her that the Lord had sent him, he asked her for something to drink and for a morsel of bread to eat; whereupon she assured him, with an oath by Jehovah, that she had nothing baked (&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1490;  equals  &#1506;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, a cake baked in hot ashes), but only a handful of meal in the &#1499;&#1468;&#1491; (a pail or small vessel in which meal was kept) and a little oil in the pitcher, and that she was just gathering wood to dress this remnant for herself and her son, that they might eat it, and then die. From this statement of the widow it is evident, on the one hand, that the drought and famine had spread across the Phoenician frontier, as indeed Menander of Ephesus attests;<p>(Note: Josephus gives this statement from his Phoenician history: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (sc., &#x399;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;) &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3a5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3a5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (Ant. viii. 13, 2). Hyperberetaeus answers to Tishri of the Hebrews; cf. Benfey and Stern, die Monatsnamen, p. 18.)<p>on the other hand, the widow showed by the oath, "as Jehovah thy God liveth," that she was a worshipper of the true God, who spoke of Jehovah as his God, because she recognised the prophet as an Israelite. </body></html>
