First, the widow had spoken of Jehovah from without, as “the Lord thy God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-14.htm" title="For thus said the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sends rain on the earth.">1Kings 17:14</a>); next, had come to recognise Him as God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-18.htm" title="And she said to Elijah, What have I to do with you, O you man of God? are you come to me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?">1Kings 17:18</a>); now she not only believes, as she had never believed before, that His servant is “a man of God”; but, in accepting the “word of Jehovah” in his mouth as “the truth,” seems undoubtedly to express conversion to Him. (Compare the stages of faith in the nobleman at Capernaum, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-47.htm" title="When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went to him, and sought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.">John 4:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-50.htm" title="Jesus said to him, Go your way; your son lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken to him, and he went his way.">John 4:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-53.htm" title="So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said to him, Your son lives: and himself believed, and his whole house.">John 4:53</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:17-24 Neither faith nor obedience shut out afflictions and death. The child being dead, the mother spake to the prophet, rather to give vent to her sorrow, than in hope of relief. When God removes our comforts from us, he remembers our sins against us, perhaps the sins of our youth, though long since past. When God remembers our sins against us, he designs to teach us to remember them against ourselves, and to repent of them. Elijah's prayer was doubtless directed by the Holy Spirit. The child revived.

He Raises Her Son to Life.<p>17-24. the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick&#8212;A severe domestic calamity seems to have led her to think that, as God had shut up heaven upon a sinful land in consequence of the prophet, she was suffering on a similar account. Without answering her bitter upbraiding, the prophet takes the child, lays it on his bed, and after a very earnest prayer, had the happiness of seeing its restoration, and along with it, gladness to the widow's heart and home. The prophet was sent to this widow, not merely for his own security, but on account of her faith, to strengthen and promote which he was directed to go to her rather than to many widows in Israel, who would have eagerly received him on the same privileged terms of exception from the grinding famine. The relief of her bodily necessities became the preparatory means of supplying her spiritual wants, and bringing her and her son, through the teachings of the prophet, to a clear knowledge of God, and a firm faith in His word (Lu 4:25).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Now by this I know; </span> now I am assured of that concerning which I began upon this sad occasion to doubt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth; </span> that the God whom thou professest is the true God, and the doctrine and religion which thou teachest is the only true religion; and therefore henceforth I wholly renounce the worship of idols. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the woman said to Elijah, now by this I know that thou art a man of God,.... She took him to be one at his first coming to her; she was in a great measure confirmed in it by the miracle of the barrel of meal and cruse of oil; but upon the death of her son, which she was ready to impute to the prophet, she was staggered at it; but now, by his resurrection from the dead, was fully assured of it: <p>and that the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth; she had known before that what he said concerning the meal and oil not failing was true; but now she was more and more convinced and assured that the God, whose prophet he was, was the true God, and that the religion he professed was the true religion, and he a true prophet, and that all his prophecies would be exactly fulfilled. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> I know that thou <i>art</i> a man of God, <i>and</i> that the word of the LORD in thy mouth <i>is</i> truth.</span><p>(l) It is hard to depend on God, unless we are confirmed by miracles.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_kings/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>. <span class="ital">Now</span> by <span class="ital">this</span>] R.V. omits the last two words. The italics of A.V. shew that there is nothing in the Hebrew for ‘by,’ and the word rendered ‘this’ is only a particle to strengthen the adverb ‘now.’ The same two words are rendered in A.V. by ‘now’ simply in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-7.htm" title="And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.">Ruth 2:7</a> and should be so translated here.

The mercy of her son’s restoration spake more surely of God’s messenger than did the stroke of his death. Jewish tradition represents this boy as the servant who afterwards accompanied Elijah, and finally became the prophet Jonah. (See Jerome, <span class="ital">Preface to Jonah</span>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth</span>] This is more than to say that the word which the prophet speaks is truth; or than that the word of the Lord is in his mouth. It expresses a conviction that the Lord Jehovah in whose name Elijah speaks is the true God. Whatever stage her religious belief had before reached, she now advances beyond it, and acknowledges Jehovah as truth itself.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24,</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">this</span>.

Hast thou come to me to bring my sin to remembrance (with God), and to kill my son?" In this half-heathenish belief there spoke at the same time a mind susceptible to divine truth and conscious of its sin, to which the Lord could not refuse His aid. Like the blindness in the case of the man born blind mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9.htm">John 9</a>, the death of this widow's son was not sent as a punishment for particular sins, but was intended as a medium for the manifestation of the works of God in her (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-3.htm">John 9:3</a>), in order that she might learn that the Lord was not merely the God of the Jews, but the God of the Gentiles also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-29.htm">Romans 3:29</a>).</body></html>
