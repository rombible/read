First, in this instance, as in the similar miracles of Elisha and of our Lord Himself, we see that God’s higher laws of miracle, like the ordinary laws of His providence, admit within their scope the supply of what we should consider as homely and trivial needs—in this respect perhaps contradicting what our expectation would have suggested. Next, that it is a miracle of multiplication, which is virtual creation—not necessarily out of nothing—doing rapidly and directly what, under ordinary laws, has to be done slowly and by indirect process.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-15.htm" title="And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.">1 Kings 17:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">She did according to the saying of Elijah — </span>Giving glory to the God of Israel, by believing his prophet. <span class="ital">O woman, great was thy faith! </span>One has not found the like, <span class="ital">no not in Israel. </span>All things considered, it exceeded that of the widow, who, when she had but two mites, cast them into the treasury.

What is laid out in charity, is set out to the best interest, upon the best security. One poor meal’s meat this poor widow gave the prophet, and in recompense of it she and her son did eat many days, and probably some of her kindred too, here included in the term <span class="ital">her house, </span>an expression which would hardly have been used of her one son.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:8-16 Many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, and some, it is likely, would have bidden him welcome to their houses; yet he is sent to honour and bless with his presence a city of Sidon, a Gentile city, and so becomes the first prophet of the Gentiles. Jezebel was Elijah's greatest enemy; yet, to show her how powerless was her malice, God will find a hiding-place for him even in her own country. The person appointed to entertain Elijah is not one of the rich or great men of Sidon; but a poor widow woman, in want, and desolate, is made both able and willing to sustain him. It is God's way, and it is his glory, to make use of, and put honour upon, the weak and foolish things of the world. O woman, great was thy faith; one has not found the like, no not in Israel. She took the prophet's word, that she should not lose by it. Those who can venture upon the promise of God, will make no difficulty to expose and empty themselves in his service, by giving him his part first. Surely the increase of this widow's faith, so as to enable her thus readily to deny herself, and to depend upon the Divine promise, was as great a miracle in the kingdom of grace, as the increase of her meal and oil in the kingdom of providence. Happy are all who can thus, against hope, believe and obey in hope. One poor meal's meat this poor widow gave the prophet; in recompence of it, she and her son did eat above two years, in a time of famine. To have food from God's special favour, and in such good company as Elijah, made it more than doubly sweet. It is promised to those who trust in God, that they shall not be ashamed in evil time; in days of famine they shall be satisfied.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As the Lord thy God liveth - The words do not prove that the woman was an Israelite, or a worshipper of the true God; any Phoenician, recognizing in Elijah's appearance the garb and manner of a Jehovistic prophet, might have thus addressed him: Baal-worshippers would have admitted Yahweh to be "a" living God.

Meeting, at his entrance into the town, the very woman who was appointed by divine providence to support him, his faith was severely tested by learning from her that her supplies were exhausted and that she was preparing her last meal for herself and son. The Spirit of God having prompted him to ask, and her to grant, some necessary succor, she received a prophet's reward (Mt 10:41, 42), and for the one meal afforded to him, God, by a miraculous increase of the little stock, afforded many to her.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">She did according to the saying of Elijah; </span> giving glory to the God of Israel, by believing his prophet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Many days, </span> i.e. a long time, even above two years: see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-1.htm" title="And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, show yourself to Ahab; and I will send rain on the earth.">1 Kings 18:1</a></span>.
