By sending him to this remote and retired place, where he was to lie concealed, so that neither friends nor foes might know where he was, God rescued him from the fury of Ahab and Jezebel, who, he knew, would seek to destroy him. That Ahab did not seize him immediately upon hearing the forementioned prediction and warning, must be ascribed to God’s overruling providence. <span class="ital">I have commanded the ravens to feed thee — </span>Or, <span class="ital">I shall command; </span>that is, effectually move them by instincts, which shall be as forcible with them, as a law or command is to men. God is said to command both brute creatures and senseless things, when he causeth them to do what he intends to effect by them. The ravens being birds of prey, and very voracious, were more likely to rob the prophet than to bring him food; but God’s command suspended their natural instinct, and made them act contrary to it. They are said to be unnatural to, and to neglect their young ones; yet, when God pleaseth, they shall feed his prophet. God could have sent angels to minister to him; but he chose winged messengers of another kind, to show that he can serve his own purposes as effectually by the meanest as by the mightiest creatures; and to give Elijah such a proof of his power and care in providing for him, as should effectually teach him to trust in God in those many and great difficulties to which he was to be exposed: and the more unfit instruments the ravens seemed to be, the more was his almighty power magnified, who controlled their natural inclinations while he employed them; and the greater encouragement was given to his prophet to rely on that power, thus engaged for him in his greatest straits and dangers. This, however, may be said for the choice of ravens for this work; that, as they are solitary birds, and delight to live about brooks of water, so are they accustomed to seek out for provisions, and to carry them to the places of their abode; on which account they were nor improper creatures for God to employ upon his service. To suppose, as some have done, that the ravens, being unclean birds, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-15.htm" title="Every raven after his kind;">Leviticus 11:15</a>,) would defile and render unclean the food they brought, is to mistake the meaning of the law in that case. The flesh of unclean animals was not to be eaten by the Israelites; but their touch, while living, communicated no ceremonial uncleanness either to food or any thing else: for asses and camels were also unclean, and yet the Jews constantly used them for carrying provisions, as well as for other purposes.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:1-7 God wonderfully suits men to the work he designs them for. The times were fit for an Elijah; an Elijah was fit for them. The Spirit of the Lord knows how to fit men for the occasions. Elijah let Ahab know that God was displeased with the idolaters, and would chastise them by the want of rain, which it was not in the power of the gods they served to bestow. Elijah was commanded to hide himself. If Providence calls us to solitude and retirement, it becomes us to go: when we cannot be useful, we must be patient; and when we cannot work for God, we must sit still quietly for him. The ravens were appointed to bring him meat, and did so. Let those who have but from hand to mouth, learn to live upon Providence, and trust it for the bread of the day, in the day. God could have sent angels to minister to him; but he chose to show that he can serve his own purposes by the meanest creatures, as effectually as by the mightiest. Elijah seems to have continued thus above a year. The natural supply of water, which came by common providence, failed; but the miraculous supply of food, made sure to him by promise, failed not. If the heavens fail, the earth fails of course; such are all our creature-comforts: we lose them when we most need them, like brooks in summer. But there is a river which makes glad the city of God, that never runs dry, a well of water that springs up to eternal life.

Such would make a good hiding-place. The situation of Cherith has not been identified. Josephus gives no form of the name, only saying that Elijah stayed <span class="greekheb">παρὰ χειμάρρῳ τινί</span> = ‘by a certain torrent-bed.’ Nor does the description ‘that is before Jordan’ help us. It probably implies that the stream from the ravine emptied itself into the Jordan, and hence the valley looked towards the river. But whether on the west side or the east we cannot tell. If the interview with Ahab was in Samaria, and Elijah travelled thence toward the east (Josephus says in contradiction of the text ‘towards the south’) it appears most likely that he crossed the Jordan, and found his retreat in the wilder parts of Gilead, which would be more distant from Ahab and less frequented than any of the ravines in the hill country of Ephraim on the east of Jordan, and with which the prophet would most likely be familiar.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Get thee he</span>nce, and turn <span class="cmt_word">thee</span> [for the construction (<span class="accented">dat</span>. <span class="accented">commodi</span>) cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-11.htm">Song of Solomon 2:11</a>] <span class="cmt_word">eastward</span> [This he must do, whichever side of the Jordan, east or west, the brook Cherith was, for his interview with Ahab had probably taken place at Samaria.

It does not seem to have occurred to the prophet that such a calamity as he had denounced against the country almost made his disappearance from the scene a necessity, or if it did, he still waited for instructions. Cf. ver. 9; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-1.htm">1 Kings 18:1</a>, etc. Not merely was his flight necessary in order to escape persecution or punishment - the search which Ahab instituted for him in part explains his disappearance - but to avoid importunity. It would have been morally impossible for him, though a man of inflexible will (Bahr) to dwell among the people, while the land groaned under the terrible burden which he had laid upon it, and which he alone was able to remove. His life would not have been safe - see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a> - and the ordeal would have been intolerable. And <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-2.htm">1 Kings 19:2</a> shows that the prophet's nature had its weaker side.

But it is much more probable that it is to be sought in the region east of the Jordan, where, indeed, Eusebius and Jerome place it. It is extremely doubtful whether the Wady-el-kelt, or any Cis-Jordanic ravine, would afford sufficient privacy. Probably Jericho was already rebuilt.

Baal (always &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; with the article, the Baal, i.e., Lord &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;) was the principal male deity of the Phoenicians and Canaanites, and generally of the western Asiatics, called by the Babylonians &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1</a>), &#x392;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, and as the sun-god was worshipped as the supporter and first principle of psychical life and of the generative and reproductive power of nature (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-13.htm">Judges 2:13</a>). Ahab erected an altar to this deity &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, in the house (temple) of Baal, which he had built at Samaria. The worship of Baal had its principal seat in Tyre, where Hiram, the contemporary of David and Solomon, had built for it a splendid temple and placed a golden pillar (&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;) therein, according to Dius and Menander, in Joseph. Ant. viii. 5, 3, and c. Ap. i. 18. Ahab also erected a similar pillar (&#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;) to Baal in his temple at Samaria (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-2.htm">2 Kings 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-27.htm">2 Kings 10:27</a>).
