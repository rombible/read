While on the one hand the position of "king's friend" is more likely to have been held by a contemporary, which the prophet's son would have been, than by one so much younger as the son of a younger brother; on the other hand the title "cohen" seems to point to a member of the royal family. (See the next note.) Azariah who was "over the officers" was chief, that is, of the "officers" mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-8.htm">1 Kings 4:8-19</a>, as appears from the identity of the term here used with the title by which they are designated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-7.htm">1 Kings 4:7</a>.<p>Principal officer - Or, "cohen."
