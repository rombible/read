It supplies accordingly here the mention of a special governor, over and above the twelve, for the royal tribe. It has been thought that as Judah was the home province, it was under no other government than that of the king’s officers at Jerusalem; but for purposes of revenue it seems hardly likely that it should have been excepted from the general system. Possibly Azariah, who was over the officers residing at the Court, may have been its territorial governor.<p>In some MSS. of the Greek Version, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/4-27.htm" title="And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came to king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing.">1Kings 4:27-28</a> immediately follow <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-19.htm" title="Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land.">1Kings 4:19</a>, and (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/4-20.htm" title="Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.">1Kings 4:20-21</a> are omitted) they form a link between <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/4-7.htm" title="And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision.">1Kings 4:7-19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/4-22.htm" title="And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and three score measures of meal,">1Kings 4:22-23</a>, in a very natural order.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-19.htm" title="Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land.">1 Kings 4:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">In the country of Gilead — </span>That is, in the remaining part of that land of Gilead which was mentioned above. <span class="ital">The only officer in the land </span>— Or rather, <span class="ital">in that land; </span>namely, in all Gilead, excepting the parcels mentioned before, the only one in all the territories of Sihon and Og.

These twelve providers for Solomon's family were emblems of the twelve apostles of Christ, appointed to provide food for his family, the church; and if you add to them the Apostle Paul, it will make thirteen, as this officer did. <p>(u) T.

This comprised all the kingdom of Sihon and part of the kingdom of Og (Deut. chh. 2. 3), and was a very extensive province, but on account of its rugged character was probably thinly populated.

Nor can can it mean the only officer in his <span class="accented">district</span>, or <span class="accented">portion</span>, of Gilead, for that is self-evident, and the remark would apply equally to all the other prefects. And we are hardly justified in translating <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span> "he was the first (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, superior), officer" (set over those mentioned above, vers. 13, 14), as Schulze. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span> used as an ordinal number, but it is only in connexion with days and years (Gesen. s.v.)

(Can it be the object of the writer to show that the royal tribe was not favoured or exempted from contributing its share?) On the whole, the difficulty would seem still to await a solution. We can hardly, in the teeth of ver. 7, suppose with Ewald, <span class="accented">al.</span> that a <span class="accented">thirteenth</span> officer is here intended. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 4:20-34. SOLOMON'S RULE, STATE, AND WISDOM. - The remainder of this chapter, which de-scribes to us the extent and character of Solomon's sway (vv. 20, 21, 24, 25), the pomp and provision of his household (vv. 22, 23, 26-28), and his profound and varied wisdom (vv. 29-34), has every appearance of a compilation from different sources. It scarcely has the order and coherence which we should find in the narrative of a single writer. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Bengeber was in Ramoth of Gilead in the tribe of Gad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/20-8.htm">Joshua 20:8</a>), probably on the site of the modern Szalt (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-43.htm">Deuteronomy 4:43</a>). "To him belonged the Havvoth Jair (Jair's-lives) in Gilead, to him the region of Argob in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and brazen bolts." If we look at this passage alone, the region of Argob in Bashan appears to be distinct from the Havvoth Jair in Gilead. But if we compare it with <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-40.htm">Numbers 32:40-41</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-4.htm">Deuteronomy 3:4-5</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-13.htm">Deuteronomy 3:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-30.htm">Joshua 13:30</a>, it is evident from these passages that the Jair's-lives are identical with the sixty large and fortified cities of the region of Argob. For, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-4.htm">Deuteronomy 3:4</a>, these sixty fortified cities, with high walls, gates, and bars, were all fortified cities of the kingdom of Og of Bashan, which the Israelites conquered under Moses, and to which, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a>, Jair the Manassite, who had conquered them, gave the name of Havvoth Jair. Hence it is stated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-30.htm">Joshua 13:30</a>, that the sixty Jair-towns were situated in Bashan. Consequently the &#1488;&#1512; &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; &#1500;&#1493; in our verse is to be taken as a more precise definition of &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1497;&#1488;&#1497;&#1512; &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1500;&#1493;, or a clearer description of the district superintended by Bengeber, so that Gilead is used, as is frequently the case, in the broader sense of Peraea. Compare with this the Commentary on <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-4.htm">Deuteronomy 3:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-13.htm">Deuteronomy 3:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>, where the names &#1488;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489; and &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; are explained, and the imaginary discrepancy between the sixty Jair's-towns in the passages cited, and the twenty-three and thirty cities of Jair in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-22.htm">1 Chronicles 2:22</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>, is discussed and solved. And when Thenius objects to this explanation on the ground that the villages of Jair cannot be identical with the sixty fortified cities, because villages of nomads and strongly fortified cities could not be one and the same, this objection falls to the ground with the untenable interpretation of &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; as applying to nomad villages.</body></html>
