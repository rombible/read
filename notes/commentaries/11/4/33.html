Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant. viii. </span>c.<span class= "ital">2</span>, § 5) supposes Solomon’s utterances on these natural products to have been allegorical and symbolic, although he declares that he described them and their properties “like a philosopher.” Rabbinical and Oriental legends, eagerly accepted in mediaeval times, ascribed to him mystic knowledge and magical use of their occult properties. Modern writers have seen in this utterance the first dawn of a scientific natural history and idyllic poetry. In all these suppositions there is some truth, though each in its literal meaning evidently interprets the work of Solomon by the ideas of its own time. An examination of the Song of Songs, and even of the Book of Proverbs—to say nothing of Ecclesiastes and several of the Psalms, and of the Book of Job, which has been thought to belong to the age of Solomon—shows in them repeated exemplifications of a deep sense of the wonder and the beauty of Nature, and also a keen observation of Natural history in detail But it also shows, as might have been expected, a constant contemplation of God in and over Nature (much as in Psalms 104), a desire to know the secret of His dispensation therein, a conception of a unity in His law over all being, and as a necessary consequence of this, a tendency to mystic interpretation and parable. If in the works here referred to, and now lost to us, there were (as Ewald supposes) “the rudiments of a complete natural history,” it would be an anachronism to doubt that they were marked by these leading characteristics.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:29-34 Solomon's wisdom was more his glory than his wealth. He had what is here called largeness of heart, for the heart is often put for the powers of the mind. He had the gift of utterance, as well as wisdom. It is very desirable, that those who have large gifts of any kind, should have large hearts to use them for the good of others. What treasures of wisdom and knowledge are lost! But every sort of knowledge that is needful for salvation is to be found in the holy Scriptures. There came persons from all parts, who were more eager after knowledge than their neighbours, to hear the wisdom of Solomon. Solomon was herein a type of Christ, in whom are hid all treasures of wisdom and knowledge; and hid for us, for he is made of God to us, wisdom. Christ's fame shall spread through all the earth, and men of all nations shall come to him, learn of him, and take upon them his easy yoke, and find rest for their souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Trees ... - A keen appreciation of the beauties of nature, and a habit of minute observation, are apparent in the writings of Solomon that remain to us.

He then goes on to tell that he was endowed with power against demons, and could cure men who were possessed with evil spirits. He is also said to have left forms of incantation and exorcism, of which, Josephus says, some knowledge had come down to his own time, and he gives a story of a Jew who wrought such a cure as he describes in the presence of the emperor Vespasian.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">he spare of</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, discoursed, treated, not necessarily wrote] <span class="cmt_word">trees</span> [In his proverbs and songs he exceeded the children of the East.

The arrangment is hardly according to manner of motion (Bahr). If anything, it is according to elements - earth, sky, sea. Both Jewish and Mohammedan writers abound in exaggerated or purely fabulous accounts of Solomon's attainments and gifts. We may see the beginning of these in Jos., Ant. 8:02.5. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And"  equals  a still further proof of the blessings of peace - "those prefects (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-7.htm">1 Kings 4:7</a>.) provided for king Solomon, and all who came to the king's table, i.e., who were fed from the royal table, every one his month (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-7.htm">1 Kings 4:7</a>), so that nothing was wanting (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-28.htm">1 Kings 4:28</a>), and conveyed the barley (the ordinary food of cattle in Palestine and the southern lands, where oats are not cultivated) and the straw for the horses and coursers to the place where it ought to be.

This is certainly more in harmony with the imperfect &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; than it would be to supply &#1492;&#1512;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;, as Bochart and others propose; still it is hardly correct. For in that case &#1493;&#1500;&#1512;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473; &#1500;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; could only be understood as referring to the chariot horses and riding horses, which Solomon kept for the necessities of his court, and not to the whole of the cavalry; since we cannot possibly assume that even if Solomon changed his residence according to the season and to suit his pleasure, or on political grounds, as Thenius supposes, though this cannot by any means be inferred from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-18.htm">1 Kings 9:18</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-19.htm">1 Kings 9:19</a>, he took 16,000 horses about with him. But this limitation of the clause is evidently at variance with the context, since &#1493;&#1500;&#1512;&#1499;&#1489; &#1500;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; too plainly refer back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a>. Moreover, "if the king were intended, he would certainly have been mentioned by name, as so many other subjects and objects have come between." For these reasons we agree with Bttcher in taking &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; indefinitely: "where it (barley and straw) was wanted, according to the distribution of the horses." &#1512;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473; probably denotes a very superior kind of horse, like the German Renner (a courser or race-horse). &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1493; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, every one according to his right, i.e., whatever was appointed for him as right. </body></html>
