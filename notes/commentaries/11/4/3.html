Seraiah’s office had descended to his sons, as was so often the case among the Jews. With the growth of the kingdom since David’s time the duties of the royal scribe, or secretary, would have been much increased; we can therefore understand that two persons were needed for the office instead of one.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Jehoshaphat</span>] He had held the same office in the days of David.

The duties of the recorder, or remembrancer, were to keep records of such events as were important in the history of the country. Such annals have afforded, no doubt, a good deal of the matter for Kings and Chronicles. Such was the ‘book of records of the Chronicles’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/6-1.htm" title="On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.">Esther 6:1</a>) in which Mordecai’s service was registered, and from which it was read out to Ahasuerus.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha</span> [probably the same person who is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a> as <span class="accented">Sheva</span>; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>, as <span class="accented">Seraiah</span>; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-16.htm">1 Chronicles 18:16</a>, as <span class="accented">Shavsha</span>, David's scribe. The office thus descended from father to sons. The variations in this name are instructive.

The recorder or "remembrancer" (marg.) was, perhaps, "chancellor" (Keil), or keeper of the king's conscience, rather than, as is generally supposed, chronicler of public events, and keeper of the archives.

Two harlots living together in one house had each given birth to a child, and one of them had "overlaid" her child in the night while asleep (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, because she had lain upon it), and had then placed her dead child in the other one's bosom and taken her living child away. When the other woman looked the next morning at the child lying in her bosom, she saw that it was not her own but the other woman's child, whereas the latter maintained the opposite. As they eventually referred the matter in dispute to the king, and each one declared that the living child was her own, the king ordered a sword to be brought, and the living child to be cut in two, and a half given to each. Then the mother of the living child, "because her bowels yearned upon her son," i.e., her maternal love was excited, cried out, "Give her (the other) the living child, but do not slay it;" whereas the latter said, "It shall be neither mine nor thine, cut it in pieces." </body></html>
