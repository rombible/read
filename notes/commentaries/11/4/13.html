It is only found in these two places.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in Ramoth-gilead</span>] We now come to the mountainous district on the eastern side of the Jordan, in which were settled the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half of Manasseh.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the towns of Jair</span>] As the Hebrew word (<span class="ital">havvoth</span>) rendered ‘towns’ is found only in this connexion it is better to treat it as a part of the proper name and render Havvoth-Jair. About these ‘towns’ there is some difficulty. They are first mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-41.htm" title="And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havothjair.">Numbers 32:41</a>) as ‘small towns’ in Gilead, and occupied by Jair the son of Manasseh. They are mentioned again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm" title="Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob to the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, to this day.">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>) and said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-30.htm" title="And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, three score cities:">Joshua 13:30</a>) to be in Bashan and to be 60 in number, whereas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-23.htm" title="And he took Geshur, and Aram, with the towns of Jair, from them, with Kenath, and the towns thereof, even three score cities. All these belonged to the sons of Machir the father of Gilead.">1 Chronicles 2:23</a> they are counted as 60 only with the addition of certain other places. In this chapter the question is, are the Havvoth-Jair included in the region of Argob or not? As there is no conjunction, between the two clauses, it seems most natural to take the latter as a fuller definition of the former. ‘To him belonged Havvoth-Jair, even the region of Argob &c.’ This has the advantage of coupling with Havvoth-Jair the number 60 which plays such a part in the other passages quoted above.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-4.htm" title="And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.">Jdg 10:4</a> where the Havvoth-Jair are again mentioned, though they are connected with the history of the judge who was so called, yet there is nothing to indicate that the naming of the cities was due to him. As Jair the son of Manasseh first occupied these places, it is likely that his name would become a common one. The sons of Jair the judge held but half the number of the towns, but that is no evidence that the other thirty were then non-existent or that they were not also included in the name Havvoth-Jair, but in the hands of different governors.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in Gilead</span>] Gilead is the name of that mountainous district, east of the Jordan, which had on the north the country of Bashan and on the south Moab and Ammon. Its chief towns were Ramoth-gilead and Jabesh-gilead. Sometimes also Jaazer is counted as belonging to it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Argob</span>] The district which in later times was called Trachonitis. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-4.htm" title="And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, three score cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.">Deuteronomy 3:4</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Bashan</span>] The country which lay immediately north of Gilead, and stretched northwards to Mount Hermon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">great cities</span> with <span class="ital">walls and brasen bars</span>] The cities of this district are so described <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-5.htm" title="All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.">Deuteronomy 3:5</a>, and there still are found in this neighbourhood ruins of walled cities (see Bunsen’s <span class="ital">Bibelwerk</span> in loc.). As the armaments and modes of warfare were of a much more primitive character than in later times, we need not picture to ourselves from this description fortifications such as would now deserve the name.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The son of Geber</span> [possibly son of the Geber mentioned in ver. 19] <span class="cmt_word">in Ramothgilead</span> [two districts east of the Jordan are now enumerated.

So Gesenius, who cites <span class="accented">Eisleben</span> and similar names] <span class="cmt_word">the son Manasseh</span> [it is doubtful whether the judge of that name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-3.htm">Judges 10:3</a>) or Jair, the son of Segub (called a "son of Manasseh" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a>, because his grandmother was a daughter of the great Machir, though his father belonged to Judah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-21.htm">1 Chronicles 2:21</a>), is intended. Probably it is the latter. (They can hardly be one and the same person, though they are often identified, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, in the Speaker's Comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-3.htm">Judges 10:3</a>. But they belong to different periods.) Curiously enough, the Havoth Jair are mentioned in connexion with each (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-4.htm">Deuteronomy 3:4, 5, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-30.htm">Joshua 13:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-22.htm">1 Chronicles 2:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>), but in every ease except the last the reference is to the son of Segub. As the judge was probably one of his descendants, it is not surprising that the judge's sons should possess some of the villages of Jair], <span class="cmt_word">which are in Gilead; to him also pertained the region</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>, lit., <span class="accented">measuring cord</span>, came to signify the region measured] <span class="cmt_word">of</span> <span class="cmt_word">Argob</span> [elsewhere "the Argob," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the stony. This is the region subsequently known as Trachonitis, now called the Lejah. It is distinguished here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-30.htm">Joshua 13:30</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-22.htm">1 Chronicles 2:22</a> from the Gileadite district just mentioned, with which it is sometimes confounded. Both seem to have been conquered by Jair, but the towns of the former bore the name of <span class="accented">Havoth Jair</span> and these of <span class="accented">Bashan Havoth Jair.</span> Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-4.htm">Deuteronomy 3:4, 5, 14</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a>. The latter consisted of threescore cities, with walls, gates, and bars. This remarkable district, twenty-two miles in length by fourteen in breadth, is "wholly composed of black basalt, which appears to have issued from innumerable pores in the earth in a liquid state .... Before cooling, its surface was violently agitated, and it was afterwards shattered and rent by convulsions .... Strange as it may seem, this ungainly and forbidding region is thickly studded with deserted cities and villages" (Porter, "Giant Cities of Bashan," also in Kitto's <span class="accented">Cycl.</span> 3. p. 1032; Dict. Bib. 1:104)] <span class="cmt_word">which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brazen bars.</span> [These words are a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-4.htm">Deuteronomy 3:4, 5</a>.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Solomon's Official Persons and Their Districts. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-7.htm">1 Kings 4:7</a>. Solomon had (appointed) twelve &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; over all Israel, who provided (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;) for the king and his house, i.e., supplied provisions for the necessities of the court. These prefects are not to be regarded as "chamberlains," or administrators of the royal domains (Michaelis and Ewald), for these are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-25.htm">1 Chronicles 27:25</a>. under a different title. They are "general receivers of taxes," or "chief tax-collectors," as Rosenmller expresses it, who levied the king's duties or taxes, which consisted in the East, as they still do to the present time, for the most part of natural productions, or the produce of the land, and not of money payments as in the West, and delivered them at the royal kitchen (Rosenmller, A. und N. Morgenland, iii. p. 166). It cannot be inferred from the explanation given by Josephus, &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;, that they exercised a kind of government, as Thenius supposes, since this explanation is nothing but a subjective conjecture. "One month in the year was it every one's duty (&#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1506;&#1500; &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;) to provide." The districts assigned to the twelve prefects coincide only partially with the territories of the tribes, because the land was probably divided among them according to its greater or smaller productiveness. Moreover, the order in which the districts are enumerated is not a geographical one, but probably follows the order in which the different prefects had to send the natural productions month by month for the maintenance of the king's court. The description begins with Ephraim in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-8.htm">1 Chronicles 27:8</a>, then passes over in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-9.htm">1 Chronicles 27:9</a> to the territory of Dan to the west of it, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-10.htm">1 Chronicles 27:10</a> to the territory of Judah and Simeon on the south, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-11.htm">1 Chronicles 27:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-12.htm">1 Chronicles 27:12</a> to the territory of Manasseh on this side from the Mediterranean to the Jordan, then in vv. 13 and 14 to the territory of Manasseh on the other side of the Jordan, thence back again in vv. 15 and 16 to the northern parts of the land on this side, viz., the territories of Naphtali and Asher, and thence farther south to Issachar in v. 17, and Benjamin in v. 18, closing at last in v. 19 with Gilead.</body></html>
