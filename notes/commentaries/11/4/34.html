Let those who magnify the modern learning above that of the ancients, produce such a treasury of learning, anywhere in these later ages, as that was which Solomon was master of. Yet this puts an honour upon human learning, that Solomon is praised for it, and recommends it to the great ones of the earth, as well worthy their diligent search.

He had what is here called largeness of heart, for the heart is often put for the powers of the mind. He had the gift of utterance, as well as wisdom. It is very desirable, that those who have large gifts of any kind, should have large hearts to use them for the good of others. What treasures of wisdom and knowledge are lost! But every sort of knowledge that is needful for salvation is to be found in the holy Scriptures. There came persons from all parts, who were more eager after knowledge than their neighbours, to hear the wisdom of Solomon. Solomon was herein a type of Christ, in whom are hid all treasures of wisdom and knowledge; and hid for us, for he is made of God to us, wisdom. Christ's fame shall spread through all the earth, and men of all nations shall come to him, learn of him, and take upon them his easy yoke, and find rest for their souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Trees ... - A keen appreciation of the beauties of nature, and a habit of minute observation, are apparent in the writings of Solomon that remain to us. The writer here means to say that Solomon composed special works on these subjects. The Lebanon cedars were the most magnificent of all the trees known to the Hebrews, and hence, represent in the Old Testament the grandest of vegetable productions.

The Spirit of God has seen fit to preserve comparatively few memorials of the fruits of his gigantic mind. The greater part of those here ascribed to him have long since fallen a prey to the ravages of time, or perished in the Babylonish captivity, probably because they were not inspired.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">From all kings of the earth, </span> to wit, from all the neighbouring kings; universal particles being frequently understood in a restrained sense; and such restriction is grounded upon the following words, where this is limited to such as heard of Solomon’s wisdom. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon,  <p>from all kings of the earth,....

The visit of the queen of Sheba (chap. 10) is preserved us probably as one of the more distant visits, and made, as could not often be the case, by the monarch in person.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Here the LXX.

It seems as though a change of order had been made that the wedding presents (<span class="greekheb">ἀποστολὰς</span>) might be mentioned at an earlier part of the narrative.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there came of all people</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">the peoples, nations</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>to hear the wisdom of Solomon</span> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-1.htm">1 Kings 10:1</a>]<span class="cmt_word">, from all the kings of the earth</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.<span class="cmt_word">,</span> </span>messengers, ambassadors, as in the next chapter], <span class="cmt_word">which had heard of his wisdom.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And"  equals  a still further proof of the blessings of peace - "those prefects (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-7.htm">1 Kings 4:7</a>.) provided for king Solomon, and all who came to the king's table, i.e., who were fed from the royal table, every one his month (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-7.htm">1 Kings 4:7</a>), so that nothing was wanting (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-28.htm">1 Kings 4:28</a>), and conveyed the barley (the ordinary food of cattle in Palestine and the southern lands, where oats are not cultivated) and the straw for the horses and coursers to the place where it ought to be. To &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; the lxx, Vulg., and others supply &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; as the subject: wherever the king might stay. This is certainly more in harmony with the imperfect &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; than it would be to supply &#1492;&#1512;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;, as Bochart and others propose; still it is hardly correct. For in that case &#1493;&#1500;&#1512;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473; &#1500;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; could only be understood as referring to the chariot horses and riding horses, which Solomon kept for the necessities of his court, and not to the whole of the cavalry; since we cannot possibly assume that even if Solomon changed his residence according to the season and to suit his pleasure, or on political grounds, as Thenius supposes, though this cannot by any means be inferred from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-18.htm">1 Kings 9:18</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-19.htm">1 Kings 9:19</a>, he took 16,000 horses about with him. But this limitation of the clause is evidently at variance with the context, since &#1493;&#1500;&#1512;&#1499;&#1489; &#1500;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; too plainly refer back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a>. Moreover, "if the king were intended, he would certainly have been mentioned by name, as so many other subjects and objects have come between." For these reasons we agree with Bttcher in taking &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; indefinitely: "where it (barley and straw) was wanted, according to the distribution of the horses." &#1512;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473; probably denotes a very superior kind of horse, like the German Renner (a courser or race-horse). &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1493; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, every one according to his right, i.e., whatever was appointed for him as right. </body></html>
