He had peace on all sides. Herein, his kingdom was a type of the Messiah's; for to Him it is promised that he shall have the heathen for his inheritance, and that princes shall worship him. The spiritual peace, and joy, and holy security, of all the faithful subjects of the Lord Jesus, were typified by that of Israel. The kingdom of God is not, as Solomon's was, meat and drink, but, what is infinitely better, righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. The vast number of his attendants, and the great resort to him, are shown by the provision daily made. Herein Christ far outdoes Solomon, that he feeds all his subjects, not with the bread that perishes, but with that which endures to eternal life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-25.htm">2 Chronicles 9:25</a>, the number of stalls for Solomon's chariot horses is stated at 4,000, instead of 40,000. The number in the present passage is probably a corruption. Solomon's chariots were but 1,400 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-14.htm">2 Chronicles 1:14</a>, for which 40,000 horses could not possibly be required. The Assyrian chariots had at most three horses apiece, while some had only two. 4,000 horses would supply the full team of three to 1,200, and the smaller team of two to 200 chariots. The number 4,000 is in due proportion to the 12,000 horses for cavalry, and is in accordance with all that we know of the military establishments of the time and country.

"Solomon was ruler over all the kingdoms from the river (Euphrates) onwards, over the land of the Philistines to the border of Egypt, who brought presents and were subject to Solomon his whole life long." Most of the commentators supply &#1493;&#1506;&#1491; before &#1508;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; (even to the land of the Philistines) after the parallel passage <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-26.htm">2 Chronicles 9:26</a>, so that the following &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; &#1493;&#1506;&#1491; would give a more precise definition of the terminus ad quem. But it is by no means probable that &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, which appears to be indispensable, should have dropped out through the oversight of a copyist, and it is not absolutely necessary to supply it, inasmuch as &#1489;&#1468; may be repeated in thought before &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1508; from the preceding clause. The participle &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; is construed ad sensum with &#1502;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514;. Bringing presents is equivalent to paying tribute, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>, etc.<p>Vv. 22-28. The splendour of the court, the consumption in the royal kitchen  (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-22.htm">1 Kings 4:22-25</a>), and the well-filled stables (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-26.htm">1 Kings 4:26-28</a>), were such as befitted the ruler of so large a kingdom.</body></html>
