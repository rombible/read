Taanach, Megiddo, and Beth-shean are all named as Canaanitish cities not taken by Manasseh, but made tributary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-11.htm" title="And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries.">Joshua 17:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-27.htm" title="Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.">Judges 1:27</a>). Taanach and Megiddo are referred to in the song of Deborah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-19.htm" title="The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.">Judges 5:19</a>). Megiddo is the place of the death of Ahaziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-27.htm" title="But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.">2Kings 9:27</a>) and the fall of Josiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm" title="In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.">2Kings 23:29</a>). Beth-shean is the city in which the body of Saul was exposed in triumph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-12.htm" title="All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.">1Samuel 31:12</a>). Abel-meholah, the birth-place of Elisha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-16.htm" title="And Jehu the son of Nimshi shall you anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shall you anoint to be prophet in your room.">1Kings 19:16</a>), lies south of Beth-shean, and is mentioned in the record of the rout of the Midianites by Gideon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-22.htm" title="And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, to Tabbath.">Judges 7:22</a>). Jokmeam (for such is the right reading) is a Levitical city in Ephraim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-68.htm" title="And Jokmeam with her suburbs, and Bethhoron with her suburbs,">1Chronicles 6:68</a>), apparently called Kibzaim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-22.htm" title="And Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Bethhoron with her suburbs; four cities.">Joshua 21:22</a>, and must have been an outlying part of this division.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-19 In the choice of the great officers of Solomon's court, no doubt, his wisdom appeared.
