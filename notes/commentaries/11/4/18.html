This district embraced the cities on the southern edge of the plain of Jezreel, and extended to the Jordan. Taanach and Megiddo, which have been preserved in the villages of Taanuk and Lejun, were situated on the south-western border of this plain, and belonged to the Manassites (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-21.htm">Joshua 12:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>). "And all Bethshean," in other words, the whole of the district of Bethshean, i.e., Beisan, at the eastern end of the valley of Jezreel, where it opens into the Jordan valley (Rob. Pal. ii. p. 740ff.), "which (district was situated) by the side of Zarthan below Jezreel, from (the town of) Bethshean (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>) to Abel-Mecholah, on the other side of Jokmeam." Zarthan, also called Zereda (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-46.htm">1 Kings 7:46</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-17.htm">2 Chronicles 4:17</a>), has probably been preserved, so far as the name is concerned, in Kurn Sartabeh, in the neighbourhood of which the old city probably stood, about five miles to the south of Beisan, at a point where the Jordan valley contracts (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-16.htm">Joshua 3:16</a>). The expression "below Jezreel" refers to "all Bethshean," and may be explained from the elevated situation of Jezreel, the present Zern (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-18.htm">Joshua 19:18</a>). According to Rob. iii. p. 163, this is "comparatively high, and commands a wide and noble view, extending down the broad low valley on the east of Beisan and to the mountains of Ajlun beyond the Jordan." The following words, "from Bethshean to Abel-Mecholah," give a more precise definition of the boundary. The lxx have erroneously inserted &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; before &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1503;, and Thenius and Bttcher defend it on the strength of their erroneous interpretations of the preceding statements. Abel-Mecholah was in the Jordan valley, according to the Onomast., ten Roman miles to the south of Beisan (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>). The last clause is not quite intelligible to us, as the situation of the Levitical city Jokmeam (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-53.htm">1 Chronicles 6:53</a>, or Kibzaim, a different place from the Jokneam on Carmel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-22.htm">Joshua 12:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-34.htm">Joshua 21:34</a>) has not yet been discovered (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-22.htm">Joshua 21:22</a>). According to this, Baanah's district in the Jordan valley did not extend so far as Kurn Sartabeh, but simply to the neighbourhood of Zarthan, and embraced the whole of the tribe-territory of Manasseh on this side of the Jordan.</body></html>
