It seems also clear that the Syrian Kingdoms (like the kingdom of Tyre), were allies on a footing of some dependence, though not exactly tributaries. This extension of dominion was the fruit of the warlike energy of the two preceding reigns. As in all ancient Eastern empires, it represented, not an organised monarchy, but the supremacy of a dominant kingdom’ over tributaries gathered round—“the kings on this side the river” who “brought presents”—apparently at that time numerous, and ruling over small territories. Such an empire would rise rapidly, and as rapidly fall to pieces; and in Solomon’s case it was sustained less by military power than by the peaceful forces of wealth and policy, and was largely dependent on his own personal ascendancy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm" title="And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.">1 Kings 4:21</a></span>. <span class="ital">From the river — </span>Euphrates; for so far David, having conquered the Syrians, extended his empire, which Solomon also maintained in that extent.

He had peace on all sides. Herein, his kingdom was a type of the Messiah's; for to Him it is promised that he shall have the heathen for his inheritance, and that princes shall worship him. The spiritual peace, and joy, and holy security, of all the faithful subjects of the Lord Jesus, were typified by that of Israel. The kingdom of God is not, as Solomon's was, meat and drink, but, what is infinitely better, righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. The vast number of his attendants, and the great resort to him, are shown by the provision daily made. Herein Christ far outdoes Solomon, that he feeds all his subjects, not with the bread that perishes, but with that which endures to eternal life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Solomon's empire, like all the great empires of Asia down to the time of the Persians, consisted of a congeries of small kingdoms, all ruled by their own kings <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24</a>, who admitted the suzerainty of the Jewish monarch, and paid him "presents," i. e., an annual tribute (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-25.htm">1 Kings 10:25</a>).<p>Unto the land of the Philistines - There is no word corresponding to "unto" in the Hebrew.

This verse in the Hebrew is the beginning of Chapter 5, which has therefore 32 verses instead of 18 as in the English division. The LXX. and the Vulgate divide as in the A.V., but the former has a different order of the verses, putting after <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-19.htm" title="Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land.">1 Kings 4:19</a>, the other verses as follows 27, 28, 22, 23, 24, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34.

It would seem best therefore to repeat the previous preposition, and render ‘<span class="ital">over</span> the land of the Philistines.’ The first section of the verse will thus embrace the kingdoms to the north and east of Israel and Judah, the second those to the south and west.

The Vulgate here, in consequence of the absence of any preposition, translates ‘a flumine terræ Philistiim.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they brought presents</span>] The noun is singular, and comprehends all that sort of offerings which tributaries rendered to their chief lord, but to which the more euphemious name of ‘gift’ or ‘present’ was assigned. Cp. for the character of these gifts <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-2.htm" title="And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive.
