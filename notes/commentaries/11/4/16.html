So read <span class="bld">Baana</span>. Here another son of his father’s friend is cared for by Solomon. Hushai, father of Baana, was devoted to David’s cause in the rebellion of Absalom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-32.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth on his head:">2 Samuel 15:32</a>) and it speaks well for Solomon that this devotion is not forgotten.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and in Aloth</span>] We meet nowhere else with the name Aloth.

Hence the R.V. has given <span class="bld">and Bealoth</span> taking the initial <span class="greekheb">ב</span> not as a preposition = <span class="ital">in</span>, but as part of the proper name. The name does occur (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-24.htm" title="Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,">Joshua 15:24</a>) but there it is of a place in the south of Judah. There may however have been another town or district so named elsewhere. The tribe of Asher, near to which this place must have been, lay on the sea-board, southward from Phœnicia, while Naphtali was to the east, and somewhat north, of it, above what in later times was the sea of Galilee.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Banaah</span> [or Baana, the second prefect of that name (ver. 12).

There was a Baaloth in Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-24.htm">Joshua 15:24</a>) and a Baaloth in Dan (ibid. 19:44), but neither of these can be meant here.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Benhesed was in Arubboth, which does not occur again, so that its situation, even if it should be identical with Arab in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-52.htm">Joshua 15:52</a>, as Bttcher conjectures, can only be approximatively inferred from the localities which follow. To him (&#1500;&#1493;), i.e., to his district, belonged Sochoh and all the land of Hepher. From Sochoh we may see that Benhesed's district was in the tribe of Judah. Of the two Sochohs in Judah, that still exist under the name of Shuweikeh, it is impossible to determine with certainty which is intended here, whether the one upon the mountains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-48.htm">Joshua 15:48</a>) or the one in the plain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-35.htm">Joshua 15:35</a>). The fact that it is associated with the land of Hepher rather favours the latter. The land of Hepher, which must not be confounded with the city of Gath-hepher in the tribe of Zebulun (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-13.htm">Joshua 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>), but was the territory of one of the Canaanitish kings who were defeated by Joshua, was probably situated in the plain (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-17.htm">Joshua 12:17</a>).</body></html>
