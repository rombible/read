In the LXX. there is here a curious and striking insertion: “he rent his clothes and put on sackcloth,” representing Ahab as struck with momentary horror, and then, after thus salving his conscience, still resolving to carry out his desire for the coveted vineyard. The picture is equally true to nature, especially to such a nature as his. But the insertion has little authority, and is probably a mistaken interpolation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-27.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.">1Kings 21:27</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:5-16 When, instead of a help meet, a man has an agent for Satan, in the form of an artful, unprincipled, yet beloved wife, fatal effects may be expected. Never were more wicked orders given by any prince, than those Jezebel sent to the rulers of Jezreel. Naboth must be murdered under colour of religion. There is no wickedness so vile, so horrid, but religion has sometimes been made a cover for it. Also, it must be done under colour of justice, and with the formalities of legal process. Let us, from this sad story, be amazed at the wickedness of the wicked, and the power of Satan in the children of disobedience. Let us commit the keeping of our lives and comforts to God, for innocence will not always be our security; and let us rejoice in the knowledge that all will be set to rights in the great day.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To take possession of it - The goods of traitors appear to have been forfeited to the crown by the Jewish law as they still are almost universally throughout the East.

This clause must be entirely out of place. Josephus gives us a detail far more in harmony with Ahab’s character. He says (<span class="ital">Ant.</span> viii. 13, 8) ‘And Ahab was pleased with what had been done, and sprang up from his bed, and went to see Naboth’s vineyard’. There was certainly no time lost by him. His entry on the possession seems to have been made the very next day after Naboth’s death. We learn afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-26.htm" title="Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, said the LORD; and I will requite you in this plat, said the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.">2 Kings 9:26</a>) that Jehu and Bidkar rode with Ahab at the time, and so appalling was the curse which Elijah pronounced on the wretched king that it was imprinted on Jehu’s memory and he could quote it many years afterwards, apparently in its very words.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab arose up</span> [According to the LXX., his first act was to rend his clothes and put on sackcloth.

But the expression "riding in pairs after Ahab" (A.V. "rode together after") does not make it certain that they were in the same chariot. Indeed, they may have been on horseback. This was apparently (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a>) on the day after the murder.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The shameless woman then wrote a letter in the name of Ahab, sealed it below with the royal seal, which probably bore the king's signature and was stamped upon the writing instead of signing the name, as is done at the present day among Arabs, Turks, and Persians (vid., Paulsen, Reg. der Morgenl. p. 295ff.), to give it the character of a royal command (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-13.htm">Esther 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-17.htm">Daniel 6:17</a>), and sent this letter (the Chethb &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is correct, and the Keri has arisen from a misunderstanding) to the elders and nobles of his town (i.e., the members of the magistracy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>), who lived near Naboth, and therefore had an opportunity to watch his mode of life, and appeared to be the most suitable persons to institute the charge that was to be brought against him. The letter ran thus: "Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people, and set two worthless men opposite to him, that they may give evidence against him: Thou hast blasphemed God and king; and lead him out and stone him, that he may die." Jezebel ordered the fasting for a sign, as though some public crime or heavy load of guilt rested upon the city, for which it was necessary that it should humble itself before God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-6.htm">1 Samuel 7:6</a>). The intention was, that at the very outset the appearance of justice should be given to the legal process about to be instituted in the eyes of all the citizens, and the stamp of veracity impressed upon the crime of which Naboth was to be accused. &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;...&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, "seat him at the head of the people," i.e., bring him to the court of justice as a defendant before all the people. The expression may be explained from the fact, that a sitting of the elders was appointed for judicial business, in which Naboth and the witnesses who were to accuse him of blasphemy took part seated. To preserve the appearance of justice, two witnesses were appointed, according to the law in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-6.htm">Deuteronomy 17:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-30.htm">Numbers 35:30</a>; but worthless men, as at the trial of Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-60.htm">Matthew 26:60</a>). &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, to bless God, i.e., to bid Him farewell, to dismiss Him, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-9.htm">Job 2:9</a>, equivalent to blaspheming God. God and king are mentioned together, like God and prince in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-27.htm">Exodus 22:27</a>, to make it possible to accuse Naboth of transgressing this law, and to put him to death as a blasphemer of God, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-11.htm">Deuteronomy 13:11</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-5.htm">Deuteronomy 17:5</a>, where the punishment of stoning is awarded to idolatry as a practical denial of God. Blaspheming the king is not to be taken as a second crime to be added to the blasphemy of God; but blaspheming the king, as the visible representative of God, was eo ipso also blaspheming God.</body></html>
