There is a like ambiguity as to the explanation of the command, “set Naboth on high,” as either an exaltation of pretended honour, or the “lifting up his head” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-20.htm" title="And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast to all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.">Genesis 40:20</a>) for accusation.

Never were more wicked orders given by any prince, than those Jezebel sent to the rulers of Jezreel. Naboth must be murdered under colour of religion. There is no wickedness so vile, so horrid, but religion has sometimes been made a cover for it. Also, it must be done under colour of justice, and with the formalities of legal process. Let us, from this sad story, be amazed at the wickedness of the wicked, and the power of Satan in the children of disobedience. Let us commit the keeping of our lives and comforts to God, for innocence will not always be our security; and let us rejoice in the knowledge that all will be set to rights in the great day.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The object of this fast was at once to raise a prejudice against Naboth, who was assumed by the elders to have disgraced the town; and at the same time to give an air of religion to the proceedings, which might blind persons to their real injustice.<p>Set Naboth on high among his people - This was not an order to do Naboth any, even apparent, honor; but simply a command to bring him forward before a court or assembly, where he might be seen by all, tried, and condemned. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. Proclaim a fast, &c.&#8212;Those obsequious and unprincipled magistrates did according to orders. Pretending that a heavy guilt lay on one, or some unknown party, who was charged with blaspheming God and the king and that Ahab was threatening vengeance on the whole city unless the culprit were discovered and punished, they assembled the people to observe a solemn fast. Fasts were commanded on extraordinary occasions affecting the public interests of the state (2Ch 20:3; Ezr 8:21; Joe 1:14; 2:15; Jon 3:5).

Pretending fears of some dreadful calamity coming upon the nation, and therefore fasting and humiliation were necessary to avert it, and it would be right to inquire what crimes were committed by men among them, and punish them for them; and intimated to them that Naboth should be chosen as the great offender, and be accused, condemned, and put to death, R. Joseph Kimchi (a) thinks the phrase signifies "call an assembly or congregation"; convene a court of judicature, from the use of the word in the Talmudic language (b); and so it is thought it is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-6.htm">Jeremiah 36:6</a> and indeed it can hardly be thought that Jezebel should have much notion of fasting; and besides, if it was a public fast, why should it be proclaimed only in Jezreel, and not throughout the kingdom? <p>and set Naboth on high among the people; the court being set, bring him to the bar and arraign him; perhaps in their courts of judicature there was a high place above the heads of the people, where criminals accused used to stand when they took their trials, that they might be seen and heard by all in court. <p>(a) Apud David.

The LXX. has <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀρχῇ τοῦ λαοῦ</span>. He was to be put in a prominent place, as one who had hitherto held an honourable position. Josephus speaks of him as <span class="greekheb">γένους ἐπιφανοῦς</span> ‘of a family of note’. By thus, at the beginning of the process, treating Naboth with honour they would seem to make it plain that, but for the evidence against him, they would have been glad to think him innocent.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she wrote in the letters, saying Proclaim a fast</span> [The object of this ordinance was to give the impression that the city was labouring under, or threatened with, a curse, because of some undiscovered sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-11.htm">Joshua 9:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-9.htm">Deuteronomy 21:9</a>), which must be removed or averted by public humiliation.

The reason for this is obvious, viz., to give a colour of impartiality to the proceedings. As Grotius, <span class="accented">Ne odio damnasse crederentur, quem ipsi honoraverunt</span>. It would also accord with the popular idea of retributive justice that Naboth should be denounced in the very hour of his triumph and exaltation.
