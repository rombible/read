Ahab stands revealed as the true culprit before God, without a shred of subterfuge to veil his ultimate responsibility. Now, briefly and sternly, the prophet notices the bolder criminal, pronouncing against her a doom of shame and horror, seldom falling upon a woman, but rightly visiting one who had forsworn the pity and modesty of her sex. In the “ditch” (see margin) outside the walls, where the refuse of the city gathers the half-wild dogs—the scavengers of Eastern cities—her dead body is to be thrown as offal, and to be torn and devoured.<p>This verse and the next are evidently the reflection of the compiler, catching its inspiration from the words of Elijah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-20.htm" title="And Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found you: because you have sold yourself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.">1Kings 21:20</a>. There is in them <span class= "bld">a </span>tone not only of condemnation, but of contempt, for a king most unkingly—thus selling himself to a half-unwilling course of crime, against the warnings of conscience, not disbelieved but neglected, for the sake of a paltry desire—thus moreover, grovelling under the open dominion of a woman, which, to an Eastern mind, familiar enough with female intrigues, but not with female imperiousness, would seem especially monstrous.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/21-25.htm" title="But there was none like to Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up....">1 Kings 21:25-26</a></span>. <span class="ital">There was none like unto Ahab — </span>Among all the kings of Israel who had been before him. <span class="ital">Whom Jezebel his wife stirred up </span>— This is added to show that temptations to sin are no excuse to the sinner. <span class="ital">He did very abominably in following idols, </span>&c. — There was no abomination which the people of Canaan committed, (here called the Amorites, according to their ancient name, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm" title="But in the fourth generation they shall come here again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.">Genesis 15:16</a>,) which Ahab did not imitate. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:17-29 Blessed Paul complains that he was sold under sin, Ro 7:14, as a poor captive against his will; but Ahab was willing, he sold himself to sin; of choice, and as his own act and deed, he loved the dominion of sin. Jezebel his wife stirred him up to do wickedly. Ahab is reproved, and his sin set before his eyes, by Elijah. That man's condition is very miserable, who has made the word of God his enemy; and very desperate, who reckons the ministers of that word his enemies, because they tell him the truth. Ahab put on the garb and guise of a penitent, yet his heart was unhumbled and unchanged. Ahab's repentance was only what might be seen of men; it was outward only. Let this encourage all that truly repent, and unfeignedly believe the holy gospel, that if a pretending partial penitent shall go to his house reprieved, doubtless, a sincere believing penitent shall go to his house justified.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>whom Jezebel stirred up - The history of Ahab's reign throughout exhibits him as completely governed by his imperious wife.

Ges. 121, 3). This threat was only so far fulfilled upon Ahab, from the compassion of God, and in consequence of his humbling himself under the divine judgment (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27-29</a>), that dogs licked his blood at Samaria when the carriage was washed in which he had died (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-38.htm">1 Kings 22:38</a>); but it was literally fulfilled in the case of his son Joram, whose corpse was cast into Naboth's piece of ground (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-25.htm">2 Kings 9:25-26</a>). </body></html>
