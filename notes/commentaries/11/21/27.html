Jezebel his wife stirred him up to do wickedly. Ahab is reproved, and his sin set before his eyes, by Elijah. That man's condition is very miserable, who has made the word of God his enemy; and very desperate, who reckons the ministers of that word his enemies, because they tell him the truth. Ahab put on the garb and guise of a penitent, yet his heart was unhumbled and unchanged. Ahab's repentance was only what might be seen of men; it was outward only. Let this encourage all that truly repent, and unfeignedly believe the holy gospel, that if a pretending partial penitent shall go to his house reprieved, doubtless, a sincere believing penitent shall go to his house justified.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The repentance of Ahab resembles that of the Ninevites <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5</a>. It has the same outward signs - fasting and sackcloth - and it has much the same inward character. It springs, not from love, nor from hatred of sin, but from fear of the consequences of sin. It is thus, although sincere and real while it lasts, shallow and exceedingly short-lived. God, however, to mark His readiness to receive the sinner who turns to Him, accepted the imperfect offering (as He likewise accepted the penitence of the Ninevites), and allowed it to delay the execution of the sentence <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-29.htm">1 Kings 21:29</a>. So the penitence of the Ninevites put off the fall of Nineveh for a century.<p>And lay in sackcloth - In this particular he seems to have gone beyond the usual practice. We do not read elsewhere of mourners passing the night in sackcloth.<p>And went softly - "As if he had no heart to go about any business" (Patrick). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27-29. Ahab &#8230; rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly&#8212;He was not obdurate, like Jezebel. This terrible announcement made a deep impression on the king's heart, and led, for a while, to sincere repentance. Going softly, that is, barefoot, and with a pensive manner, within doors. He manifested all the external signs, conventional and natural, of the deepest sorrow. He was wretched, and so great is the mercy of God, that, in consequence of his humiliation, the threatened punishment was deferred.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i. e.

(not, hast thou ever found me thine enemy? - Vulg., Luth.) i.e., dost thou come to meet me again, mine enemy? He calls Elijah his enemy, to take the sting from the prophet's threat as an utterance caused by personal enmity. But Elijah fearlessly replied, "I have found (thee), because thou sellest thyself to do evil in the eyes of the Lord." He then announced to him, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-22.htm">1 Kings 21:22</a>, the extermination of his house, and to Jezebel, as the principal sinner, the most ignominious end (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-23.htm">1 Kings 21:23</a>). &#1492;&#1512;&#1506; &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; &#1495;&#1514;&#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512; to sell one's self to do evil, i.e., to give one's self to evil so as to have no will of one's own, to make one's self the slave of evil (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-25.htm">1 Kings 21:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-17.htm">2 Kings 17:17</a>).
