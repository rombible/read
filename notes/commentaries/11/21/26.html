Jezebel his wife stirred him up to do wickedly. Ahab is reproved, and his sin set before his eyes, by Elijah. That man's condition is very miserable, who has made the word of God his enemy; and very desperate, who reckons the ministers of that word his enemies, because they tell him the truth. Ahab put on the garb and guise of a penitent, yet his heart was unhumbled and unchanged. Ahab's repentance was only what might be seen of men; it was outward only. Let this encourage all that truly repent, and unfeignedly believe the holy gospel, that if a pretending partial penitent shall go to his house reprieved, doubtless, a sincere believing penitent shall go to his house justified.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Amorites appear here as representatives of the old Canaanite nations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a> note).

The Amorites are mentioned probably because, being widely spread, the name had become representative of all the nations cast out before the children of Israel.
