To interpret them as simply part of Ahab’s title, or as signifying the country, not the town of Samaria, is to explain them away.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/21-18.htm" title="Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he is gone down to possess it....">1 Kings 21:18-19</a></span>. <span class="ital">Arise, go to meet Ahab, which is in Samaria — </span>That is, who reigns in Samaria. <span class="ital">Behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth — </span>Or, rather, he will be there by the time thou comest thither. <span class="ital">And speak unto him, Hast thou killed and also taken possession? </span>— Thou hast murdered an innocent and righteous man; and, instead of repenting of thy crime, hast added another piece of injustice and violence to it, and art going, confidently and cheerfully, to reap the fruit of thy wickedness. He ascribes Jezebel’s act to Ahab, because Jezebel did it by his connivance, consent, and authority, and for the gratification of his inordinate desire. <span class="ital">In the place where dogs licked, </span>&c. — Instead of <span class="ital">the place, </span>some would render the original word here used, <span class="ital">the manner, </span>and so the sense of the passage will be, <span class="ital">As the dogs licked, </span>or, <span class="ital">in like manner </span>as they <span class="ital">licked Naboth’s blood, even so shall they lick thy blood: </span>mark what I say, <span class="ital">even thine. </span>According to this reading, the prophet foretold that this judgment should come upon him, but did not assign the place; accordingly, the dogs licked Ahab’s blood, not in Jezreel, but in Samaria, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-38.htm" title="And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armor; according to the word of the LORD which he spoke.">1 Kings 22:38</a>. If, however, our translation be preferred, it may be observed, 1st, Ahab’s blood was licked by the dogs, if not in the same individual, yet in the same general place, Jezreel being in the territory of Samaria. 2d, This was particularly accomplished in his son Joram, as is affirmed <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/9-25.htm" title="Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden on him;...">2 Kings 9:25-26</a>, whose blood is not improperly called Ahab’s, children being said to be born of their parents’ blood. The expression, indeed, <span class="ital">thy blood, even thine, </span>seems to show that the threatening was at first denounced against Ahab’s person, and designed to be fulfilled in him: but afterward, upon his humiliation, the punishment was in part transferred from him to his son, as is expressed <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-29.htm" title="See you how Ahab humbles himself before me? because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil on his house.">1 Kings 21:29</a>; yet upon Ahab’s returning to sin, as is related in the next chapter, he brought back the curse upon himself, and so it is no wonder that it was in some sort fulfilled in him also.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:17-29 Blessed Paul complains that he was sold under sin, Ro 7:14, as a poor captive against his will; but Ahab was willing, he sold himself to sin; of choice, and as his own act and deed, he loved the dominion of sin. Jezebel his wife stirred him up to do wickedly. Ahab is reproved, and his sin set before his eyes, by Elijah. That man's condition is very miserable, who has made the word of God his enemy; and very desperate, who reckons the ministers of that word his enemies, because they tell him the truth. Ahab put on the garb and guise of a penitent, yet his heart was unhumbled and unchanged. Ahab's repentance was only what might be seen of men; it was outward only. Let this encourage all that truly repent, and unfeignedly believe the holy gospel, that if a pretending partial penitent shall go to his house reprieved, doubtless, a sincere believing penitent shall go to his house justified.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To take possession of it - The goods of traitors appear to have been forfeited to the crown by the Jewish law as they still are almost universally throughout the East.

The appearance of the prophet, at such a time, was ominous of evil, but his language was much more so (compare Eze 45:8; 46:16-18).
