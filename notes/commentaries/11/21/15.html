Never were more wicked orders given by any prince, than those Jezebel sent to the rulers of Jezreel. Naboth must be murdered under colour of religion. There is no wickedness so vile, so horrid, but religion has sometimes been made a cover for it. Also, it must be done under colour of justice, and with the formalities of legal process. Let us, from this sad story, be amazed at the wickedness of the wicked, and the power of Satan in the children of disobedience. Let us commit the keeping of our lives and comforts to God, for innocence will not always be our security; and let us rejoice in the knowledge that all will be set to rights in the great day.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Naboth had sons who were also put to death at this time (marginal reference). It is not improbable that they were stoned together with their parent (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24-25</a>).

To whom she communicated the news as soon as possible: <p>arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money, for Naboth is not alive, but dead; some think that Naboth was a near relation to Ahab, his father's brother's son (e); which they endeavour to support from his estate lying next to Ahab's, and from his being ordered to be set in an high place among the people; and Josephus, as before observed, says he was of illustrious descent; and so Ahab upon his death, his sons being also put to death with him, was next heir to his estate; and therefore Jezebel bid him enter on the possession of it, he being dead, and his sons also, and therefore there was nothing in his way to obstruct him: but rather her meaning is, that Naboth was dead, not of a natural but violent death, by the hand of the civil magistrate; as for blasphemy against God, so for treason against the king, in virtue of which his estate was forfeited to the crown, and that Ahab had a right to possess it; and so it was certainly condemned in later times however among the Jews, that if a man was condemned to die by the sanhedrim, his goods came to his heirs, but if for treason against the king, they ceded to him (f). <p>(e) T.

Others have suggested that there was some relationship between Ahab and the family of Naboth. It seems unnecessary to seek for reasons in such a case.

The letter ran thus: "Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people, and set two worthless men opposite to him, that they may give evidence against him: Thou hast blasphemed God and king; and lead him out and stone him, that he may die." Jezebel ordered the fasting for a sign, as though some public crime or heavy load of guilt rested upon the city, for which it was necessary that it should humble itself before God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-6.htm">1 Samuel 7:6</a>). The intention was, that at the very outset the appearance of justice should be given to the legal process about to be instituted in the eyes of all the citizens, and the stamp of veracity impressed upon the crime of which Naboth was to be accused. &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;...&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, "seat him at the head of the people," i.e., bring him to the court of justice as a defendant before all the people. The expression may be explained from the fact, that a sitting of the elders was appointed for judicial business, in which Naboth and the witnesses who were to accuse him of blasphemy took part seated. To preserve the appearance of justice, two witnesses were appointed, according to the law in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-6.htm">Deuteronomy 17:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-30.htm">Numbers 35:30</a>; but worthless men, as at the trial of Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-60.htm">Matthew 26:60</a>). &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, to bless God, i.e., to bid Him farewell, to dismiss Him, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-9.htm">Job 2:9</a>, equivalent to blaspheming God. God and king are mentioned together, like God and prince in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-27.htm">Exodus 22:27</a>, to make it possible to accuse Naboth of transgressing this law, and to put him to death as a blasphemer of God, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-11.htm">Deuteronomy 13:11</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-5.htm">Deuteronomy 17:5</a>, where the punishment of stoning is awarded to idolatry as a practical denial of God. Blaspheming the king is not to be taken as a second crime to be added to the blasphemy of God; but blaspheming the king, as the visible representative of God, was eo ipso also blaspheming God.</body></html>
