Jezebel his wife stirred him up to do wickedly. Ahab is reproved, and his sin set before his eyes, by Elijah. That man's condition is very miserable, who has made the word of God his enemy; and very desperate, who reckons the ministers of that word his enemies, because they tell him the truth. Ahab put on the garb and guise of a penitent, yet his heart was unhumbled and unchanged. Ahab's repentance was only what might be seen of men; it was outward only. Let this encourage all that truly repent, and unfeignedly believe the holy gospel, that if a pretending partial penitent shall go to his house reprieved, doubtless, a sincere believing penitent shall go to his house justified.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The prophet changes, without warning, from speaking in his own person to speaking in the person of God.

Since, for example, in the case of blasphemy the property of the criminal was forfeited to the Lord as cherem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-16.htm">Deuteronomy 13:16</a>), the property of traitors was regarded as forfeited to the king. </body></html>
