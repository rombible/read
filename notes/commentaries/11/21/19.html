The marked particularity and emphasis of that sentence, “In the place where the dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick <span class= "ital">thy blood, even thine,</span>” preclude all explanations, which would seek its fulfilment in the fate of Jehoram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-25.htm" title="Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden on him;">2Kings 9:25</a>); nor can such explanations be justified by reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-29.htm" title="See you how Ahab humbles himself before me? because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil on his house.">1Kings 21:29</a>, for it is not this part of the sentence which is deferred by Ahab’s repentance.

Jezebel his wife stirred him up to do wickedly. Ahab is reproved, and his sin set before his eyes, by Elijah. That man's condition is very miserable, who has made the word of God his enemy; and very desperate, who reckons the ministers of that word his enemies, because they tell him the truth. Ahab put on the garb and guise of a penitent, yet his heart was unhumbled and unchanged. Ahab's repentance was only what might be seen of men; it was outward only. Let this encourage all that truly repent, and unfeignedly believe the holy gospel, that if a pretending partial penitent shall go to his house reprieved, doubtless, a sincere believing penitent shall go to his house justified.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? - These words rebuke especially Ahab's indecent haste.

The main fulfillment was by the casting of the dead body of Jehoram into Naboth's plot of ground at Jezreel, where, like Naboth's, it was left for the dogs to eat <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-25.htm">2 Kings 9:25</a>. This spot, which was just outside the city wall, and close to a gate <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-31.htm">2 Kings 9:31</a>, was probably the actual scene of Naboth's execution. Here did dogs lick Ahab's blood, that is, his son's blood, the execution of the full retaliatory sentence having been deferred to the days of his son, formally and explicitly, on Ahab's repentance <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-29.htm">1 Kings 21:29</a>. But, besides this, there was a secondary fulfillment of the prophecy, when, not at Jezreel but at Samaria (marginal reference), the actual blood of Ahab himself, was licked by dogs, only in a way that implied no disgrace. These two fulfillments are complementary to each other. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.

But it may further be observed, that although upon Ahab’s humiliation the curse here threatened might seem to be wholly translated from his person to his posterity; yet upon Ahab’s return to sin, in the next chapter, he brings back the curse upon himself, and so it is no wonder if it be in some sort fulfilled in him also.

Killed in order to possess, and now taken possession upon the murder; some versions, as the Vulgate Latin and Arabic, read without an interrogation, "thou hast killed and hath taken possession", so Joseph Kimchi and Ben Melech; charging him with the murder of Naboth, and the unjust possession of his vineyard; the murder is ascribed to him, because his covetousness was the cause of it; and it was done by the contrivance of his wife; and it is highly probable Ahab knew more of it, and connived at it, and consented to it, than what is recorded, and however, by taking possession upon it, he abetted the fact: <p>and thou shalt speak unto him, saying, in the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine; which was fulfilled in his sons, who were his flesh and blood, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a>, for the punishment was respited in his days, and transferred to his sons, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-29.htm">1 Kings 21:29</a>, though dogs did lick his blood, even his blood also, according to this prophecy, though not in the same place, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-38.htm">1 Kings 22:38</a>, wherefore some take these words not to be expressive of the place where, but of the cause or reason for which this should be done, and read the words, "inasmuch", or "because dogs have licked" (h), &amp;c. <p>(h)  "pro eo quod", Junius &amp; Tremellius; "propierea quod", Grotius; so some in Vatablus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> Hast thou killed, and also taken possession?

He had neither known nor cared to know (as it seems) what Jezebel’s plans were and only thought of the end which they accomplished. He was willing by taking possession to reap the advantage, as he thought it; God lays on him the first penalty.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and thou shalt speak unto him, saying</span>] The LXX. omits these words. See above on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-15.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.">1 Kings 21:15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth</span>] From the history of Ahab’s death, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-38.htm" title="And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armor; according to the word of the LORD which he spoke.">1 Kings 22:38</a>, it appears that his blood was thus licked by the dogs, not at Jezreel, but near Samaria. The best explanation of this is that the word ‘place’ does not here mean ‘precise locality’. Naboth’s blood was shed outside the gate of Jezreel, and the pool of Samaria, from the description in the next chapter, and from what we know of the conduits and reservoirs of Eastern cities, was apparently outside the gate of that city. Thus there was a similarity between the two cases. We must also bear in mind that the sentence on Ahab was modified and its exact fulfilment deferred. When Jehoram was killed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-25.htm" title="Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden on him;">2 Kings 9:25</a>) a much more definite phrase is used for the place where his body was cast out. There it is, ‘in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Instead of ‘dogs’ simply, the LXX. (<span class="ital">Vat</span>.) has ‘the swine and the dogs’ and (<span class="ital">Alex</span>.) ‘the dogs and the swine’. It is not easy to decide how the swine came to be mentioned in the Greek Versions, but as neither text makes any mention of them in the second part of this clause, the words must be taken as the insertion of some one who desired to give a touch of greater horror to the picture.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">Vat</span>. LXX. adds to the close of this verse ‘and the harlots shall wash in thy blood’, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-38.htm" title="And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armor; according to the word of the LORD which he spoke.">1 Kings 22:38</a> both <span class="ital">Alex</span>. and <span class="ital">Vat</span>. have the statement that this was done. Moreover the true rendering in that place, of the words which in A.V. read, ‘and they washed his armour’, is ‘Now the harlots washed themselves there’.

But as Bahr observes, "How thoughtless our author must have been if in two consecutive chapters - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, on the same leaf, as it were - he had inadvertently inserted direct contradictions." And the following considerations will show that the discrepancy is only apparent. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The sentence here pronounced against Ahab was, on his repentance, stayed in its execution. God said distinctly, "I will not bring the evil in his days," and as distinctly added that He would "bring the evil in his <span class="accented">son's days, upon his house"</span> (ver. 29). And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> with the prophecy, as thus modified, the facts exactly record. The body of Jehoram was "cast into the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite" (2 Kings <span class="accented">l.c.</span>). And if it be objected <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that our historian sees in the death of Ahab <span class="accented">in Samaria</span> (ch. 20. <span class="accented">l.c.</span>) a fulfilment of this prophecy, the answer is that that death was a <span class="accented">partial</span> fulfilment of Elijah's words. The repentance of Ahab, having secured him immunity from this sentence, his subsequent folly and sin (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-27.htm">1 Kings 22:27</a>) nevertheless brought down upon him a judgment of God strikingly similar, as we might expect it would be, to that originally denounced against him, which was now reserved for his son. In ether words, the prophecy was fulfilled to the letter in the person of his son, but it had a secondary fulfilment in its spirit on himself]. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The elders of Jezreel executed this command without delay; a striking proof both of deep moral corruption and of slavish fear of the tyranny of the ruthless queen.</body></html>
