First comes the bitter irony of the question, “Dost thou govern the kingdom of Israel, and yet suffer a subject to cross thy will?” expressing her scornful wonder at one who “lets I dare not, wait upon 1 would.” Then in the invitation, “eat bread, and let thine heart be merry,” there seems the same half-contemptuous recognition of a self-indulgent weakness of nature, which may be traced in Elijah’s words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-41.htm" title="And Elijah said to Ahab, Get you up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.">1Kings 18:41</a>, “Get thee up, eat and drink, for there is a sound of abundance of rain.” Ahab is fit only to desire and to revel; it is for bolder spirits to act for good or for evil.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-7.htm" title="And Jezebel his wife said to him, Do you now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let your heart be merry: I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.">1 Kings 21:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">Jezebel said, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? </span>— Art thou fit to be a king who canst put up with such affronts from thy subjects, and hast not courage to dispose of them and theirs as seemeth good unto thee? <span class="ital">I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth — </span>Trouble thyself no further about it, but leave the matter to me; I will manage it to thy satisfaction, and the vineyard shall be thine, and shall cost thee nothing.

Never were more wicked orders given by any prince, than those Jezebel sent to the rulers of Jezreel. Naboth must be murdered under colour of religion. There is no wickedness so vile, so horrid, but religion has sometimes been made a cover for it. Also, it must be done under colour of justice, and with the formalities of legal process. Let us, from this sad story, be amazed at the wickedness of the wicked, and the power of Satan in the children of disobedience. Let us commit the keeping of our lives and comforts to God, for innocence will not always be our security; and let us rejoice in the knowledge that all will be set to rights in the great day.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The meaning is, "Art thou king, and yet sufferest thyself to be thwarted in this way by a mere subject?

The Hebrew order is ‘Thou now governest, &c.’ the pronoun being emphatically expressed. So that the sense is ‘<span class="ital">Thou</span> art king, art thou not? why then let such a matter trouble thee or stand in the way of thy will.’ The proposal of some to take the words as imperative, ‘Thou, do thou use thy sovereignty, &c.’ is opposed to what follows. For Jezebel does not urge Ahab to act the despot’s part, but plays it for him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I will give thee</span>, &c.] The ‘I’ in this clause is emphatically expressed, just as ‘thou’ in the preceding one.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jezebel his wife said unto him.

The commentators generally, however, understand the words - as the LXX. and the A.V. - as an ironical question, "Art thou ruler in aught but name?" though some take it as an imperative: "Do thou now exert authority over the kingdom of Israel," And on the whole, this latter interpretation appears to be preferable.

From the fact that Ahab is called the king of Samaria we may infer that Jezreel, the present Zerin (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-18.htm">Joshua 19:18</a>), was only a summer residence of the king.</body></html>
