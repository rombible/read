The prophecy referred to is, of course, that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/2-30.htm" title="Why the LORD God of Israel said, I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD said, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.">1Samuel 2:30-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/3-11.htm" title="And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that hears it shall tingle.">1Samuel 3:11-14</a>, fulfilled by the degradation, in Abiathar’s person, of the house of Ithamar, and the exaltation, or restoration, in Zadok, of the house of Eleazar, to whom, as the elder son of Aaron, the primacy would have seemed naturally to belong. It seems clear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-35.htm" title="And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.">1Kings 2:35</a> that Abiathar had hitherto had some superiority, although in the various notices of the two, Zadok’s name stands first; but whether of actual authority, or only of priority of dignity, cannot be determined. While the Tabernacle remained at Gibeon under Zadok’s charge, and the Ark was in Mount Zion under Abiathar, there might, indeed, be something like co-ordination between the two. This, in any case, must have disappeared at the building of the Temple; and the disgrace of Abiathar determined that the undivided dignity should pass to Zadok.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:26-34 Solomon's words to Abiathar, and his silence, imply that some recent conspiracies had been entered into. Those that show kindness to God's people shall have it remembered to their advantage. For this reason Solomon spares Abiathar's life, but dismisses him from his offices. In case of such sins as the blood of beasts would atone for, the altar was a refuge, but not in Joab's case. Solomon looks upward to God as the Author of peace, and forward to eternity as the perfection of it. The Lord of peace himself gives us that peace which is everlasting.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That he might fulfil the word of the L RD - We need not understand this as stating that the fulfillment of the old prophecy was Solomon's motive, or even one of his motives. The reference is to the overruling providence of God, which thus brought about the fulfillment of the prophecy. (Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-22.htm">Matthew 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-15.htm">Matthew 2:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-35.htm">Matthew 27:35</a>, etc.) The deposition of Abiathar involved the rejection of the house of Ithamar <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-3.htm">1 Chronicles 24:3</a>, to which Eli belonged, and the reestablishment of the high priesthood in the line of Eleazar. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26, 27. unto Abiathar the priest said the king&#8212;This functionary, as the counsellor or accomplice of Adonijah, had deserved to share his fate. But partly from regard to his priestly dignity, and partly from his long associations with the late king, Solomon pronounced on him the mitigated sentence of banishment to his country estate at Anathoth, and thereby, as God's vicegerent, deprived him of his office and its emoluments. The sacred writer notices the remarkable fulfilment, Abiathar's degradation from the high priesthood (see on [293]1Ki 4:4), of the doom denounced against the house of Eli (1Sa 2:30).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">From being priest unto the Lord; </span> either from his office, or at least, from the execution of his office.

But that seems to be a mistake; for although that passage immediately follows the history of what was done in the time of David’s life and health, when he was in a capacity of going into the public congregation; yet it manifestly belongs to another time, and was done after it; for he there speaks of Solomon’s <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">being made king the second time, </span> and he was made king but twice; once undoubtedly before this, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-1.htm" title="So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.">1 Chronicles 23:1</a></span>; and again <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-39.htm" title="And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon.

He deposed him from his office of high priest, otherwise I suppose he might officiate as a common priest, at least in some of the branches of it; this was done by his own authority as a king, and not as a prophet, as Bellarmine vainly distinguishes; and not by the authority of the college of the, priests, at the instance of Solomon, as Fortunatus Schacchus says (d) for which there is no foundation: <p>that he might fulfil the word of the Lord; which he might do intentionally, having knowledge of it, or however eventually: <p>which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh; of which house Abiathar was, and which, according to that prophecy, was to be demolished, and the priesthood translated from it, which was in the line of lthamar, to another house, in the line of Eleazar; the word of the Lord, referred to, is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-31.htm">1 Samuel 2:31</a>. <p>(d) Elaeochrism.

The order of descent from Eli was Eli—Phinehas—Ahitub—Ahimelech—Abiathar. These were of the family of Ithamar. Zadok was of the family of Eleazar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-8.htm" title="And Ahitub begat Zadok, and Zadok begat Ahimaaz,">1 Chronicles 6:8</a>). This is the first passage in the O.T. where the phrase ‘to fulfil the word of the Lord’ appears.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Solomon thrust out Abtathar from being priest unto the Lord, that he might fulfil</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">to fulfil</span> "An addition of the narrator, not the intention of Solomon.

With his deposition the high priesthood reverted to the house of Eleazar, and so another "word of the Lord" had its fulfilment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-15.htm">Numbers 25:15</a>).] No one can justly accuse Solomon of unnecessary severity or of cruelty in his treatment of Abiathar. On the occasion of his first conspiracy, Abiathar seems to have escaped even censure. And yet that conspiracy, had it succeeded, would almost certainly have involved Solomon's death (ch. 1:12). He is now found plotting again, for the action of Solomon proves that there had been a second plot. Oriental usages would have justified his death. He is simply warned and banished. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To her request, "Let Abishag of Shunem be given to Adonijah thy brother for a wife" (&#1488;&#1514; &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;, cf. Ges. 143, 1, a.), which she regarded in her womanly simplicity as a very small one (&#1511;&#1496;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;), he replied with indignation, detecting at once the intrigues of Adonijah: "And why dost thou ask Abishag of Shunem for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom, for he is my elder brother; and indeed for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah." The repetition of &#1500;&#1493; in &#1493;&#1500;&#1493; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-22.htm">1 Kings 2:22</a>), for the purpose of linking on another clause, answers entirely to the emotional character of the words. "For him, and for Abiathar and Joab:" Solomon said this, because these two men of high rank had supported Adonijah's rebellion and wished to rule under his name. There is no ground for any such alterations of the text as Thenius proposes. - Although Abishag had been only David's nurse, in the eyes of the people she passed as his concubine; and among the Israelites, just as with the ancient Persians (Herod. iii. 68), taking possession of the harem of a deceased king was equivalent to an establishment of the claim to the throne (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-8.htm">2 Samuel 12:8</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-7.htm">2 Samuel 3:7-8</a>). According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21</a>, this cannot have been unknown even to Bathsheba; but as Adonijah's wily words had disarmed all suspicion, she may not have thought of this, or may perhaps have thought that Abishag was not to be reckoned as one of David's concubines, because David had not known her (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-4.htm">1 Kings 1:4</a>).</body></html>
