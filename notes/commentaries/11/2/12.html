But these are apparently crushed without the slightest effort, though with no little fierceness and severity; and the royalty of Solomon rises at once to a colossal greatness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-12.htm" title="Then sat Solomon on the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.">1 Kings 2:12</a>. </span><span class="ital">Then sat Solomon upon the throne, </span>&c. — The kingdom was settled upon him with universal consent and approbation. <span class="ital">His kingdom was established — </span>He had the hearty affections of his people, which all men know to be a prince’s best and surest establishment.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:12-25 Solomon received Bathsheba with all the respect that was owing to a mother; but let none be asked for that which they ought not to grant. It ill becomes a good man to prefer a bad request, or to appear in a bad cause. According to eastern customs it was plain that Adonijah sought to be king, by his asking for Abishag as his wife, and Solomon could not be safe while he lived. Ambitious, turbulent spirits commonly prepare death for themselves.
