He is Shimei still, and wants nothing but a fair opportunity to declare it. Clear him not, therefore, as I did, if thou findest him guilty of any mal-practices; <span class="ital">but his hoar head bring down, </span>&c. — Cut him off as an old offender and dangerous enemy, to secure thy own peace, and the safety of thy government. In this sense Josephus understands the words. But, certainly, David’s telling Solomon, that he <span class="ital">sware to Shimei he would not put him to death for his outrage and treason, </span>is a demonstrative proof that he did not advise Solomon to put him to death for the crime that he himself had solemnly forgiven; for can any one imagine David would tell Solomon that he had sworn not to put Shimei to death, and in the same breath order him, in defiance of his oath, to be put to death? If he had intended that Solomon should immediately put him to death, there would have been neither reason nor sense in the words, <span class="ital">Thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him. </span>For to what purpose was it to tell Solomon that he knew how to behave to Shimei, if David’s command was immediately to cut him off, and Solomon understood him in that sense? But it is certain Solomon did not understand his father in that sense, by his ordering him to build a house for himself in Jerusalem, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-36.htm" title="And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build you an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth there any where.">1 Kings 2:36</a>,) as well as from the different manner in which he treated Shimei and Joab. The fact is, David advised his son to keep a strict watch over Shimei, and to put him to death only, if, on any new offence, he should again forfeit his life; and this, it is hoped, has been made appear to be the truth of the case. Now, how is this inconsistent with piety, or the advice of a prince on his death-bed? It is true, forgiveness of enemies is a duty, provided they cease to become our enemies; but no man is obliged, by any law, so to forgive an enemy, continuing such, as not to take the proper methods to guard against the effects of his enmity, and bring him to justice, if no other method will prove effectual. Much less is a <span class="ital">prince </span>obliged so to forgive an implacable enemy to his crown and government, and one who is likely to disturb the settlement of the crown in his successor, as not to order the successor to be upon his guard against him, and punish him, when guilty, according to his demerits. Such a caution and order is what he owes to his people; he may die as a <span class="ital">private person, </span>in charity with all mankind, and forgive every private injury against himself; and yet, as a <span class="ital">prince, </span>advise what is necessary for the public good after his decease, and even the execution of particular persons, if, by abusing the lenity and respite they once received, they should be guilty of new and capital offences. — Chandler. Doctor Waterland, Le Clerc, and Calmet, give the same interpretation with Doctor Chandler. The reader will probably think that the above reasoning sufficiently justifies David in this particular, even on supposition that the text is rightly translated, which, however, Dr. Delaney is of opinion it is not. The Hebrew particle, <span class="greekheb">ו</span>, <span class="ital">vau, </span>he thinks, ought to have been rendered here, as in all similar cases, not <span class="ital">connectively, </span>but <span class="ital">disjunctively, </span>as it is <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-8.htm" title="Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:">Proverbs 30:8</a>, and in many other places. “Agur,” says he, “beseeches God to keep him from the extremes of poverty and wealth. If the particle <span class="ital">vau </span>were to be interpreted here connectively, the petition would run thus: <span class="ital">Give me not poverty and riches. </span>Every one sees the absurdity of this petition; and therefore the translators rightly rendered it, <span class="ital">Give me neither poverty nor riches. </span>In the same analogy, the passage in question, rightly translated, will stand thus: <span class="ital">Now, therefore, neither hold him guiltless, </span>(<span class="ital">for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him,</span>) <span class="ital">nor his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood. </span>This advice, in this sense, is full of humanity, as well as wisdom, and Solomon (we see) understood and observed it in this sense, and in no other.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:5-11 These dying counsels concerning Joab and Shimei, did not come from personal anger, but for the security of Solomon's throne, which was the murders he had committed, but would readily repeat them to carry any purpose; though long reprieved, he shall be reckoned with at last. Time does not wear out the guilt of any sin, particularly of murder. Concerning Shimei, Hold him not guiltless; do not think him any true friend to thee, or thy government, or fit to be trusted; he has no less malice now than he had then.

Find out some good reason for vengeance to be taken on him. We are not to wonder at these injunctions of David, which were not unnatural, both for the satisfaction of his own feelings and for providing for the security of Solomon’s throne. Joab was a dangerous man to be left alive, and Shimei, with Oriental fickleness, would curse Solomon as readily as he had cursed David, should a reverse of fortune come upon him. Nor are we to look for New Testament virtues in even the best men of the older covenant. The Christian thinks it nobler to forgive, following the lessons of his master, but what David saw of Christ was in the less clear vision of faith, and neither he nor his people are to be expected to rise in any great degree towards the nobility of Christian forgiveness. Yet David was very generous toward Saul. He seems to have become less forgiving in his old age, though doubtless he was thinking chiefly of Solomon’s safety.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore</span> [lit., "<span class="accented">and</span> <span class="accented">now."</span> Possibly the "now" is a note of time in apposition to the "day" of ver. 8, or rather the time of David's oath. "I then unadvisedly swam unto him, but now the law must have its course." Probably it is merely inferential, - <span class="accented">quae cum ita sint</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>hold him not guiltless</span> [rather, <span class="accented">thou shalt not leave him unpunished</span> (Vatablus, Gesen., Bahr, <span class="accented">al.</span>); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>]; <span class="cmt_word">for thou art a wise man</span> [<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> rather than <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.) Gesen. renders here, "endued with ability to judge." David clearly desires  that wisdom and justice, not malice or passion, should be Solomon's guide], <span class="cmt_word">and knowest what thou oughtest to</span> [lit., <span class="accented">shalt</span> or <span class="accented">shouldest</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>do to him; but</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>his hoar head</span> [mentioned, not maliciously, but with the idea that punishment, which had been long delayed, must overtake him nevertheless. The age of Joab and Shimei would make the Divine Nemesis the more conspicuous. Men would "see that there was a God that judgeth in the earth"] <span class="cmt_word">bring thou down to the grave with blood.</span> The Auth. Version here needlessly alters the <span class="accented">order</span> of the original, which should be followed wherever it can be (and it generally can) without sacrifice of idiom and elegance. In this case the alteration, by the slight prominence it gives to "hoar head" and to "blood," gives a factitious harshness to the sentence. The Hebrew stands thus: "And thou shalt bring down his hoar head with blood to Sheol." This order of the words also exhibits somewhat more clearly the sequence of thought, which is this: "Thou art wise, therefore thou knowest what by law thou shouldest do. What thou shalt do is, thou shalt bring down," etc. It is clear from these words that if David was actuated by malice, by a "passionate desire to punish those who had wronged him" (Plumptre, Dict. Bib., art. "Solomon"), or by "fierce and profound vindictiveness" (Stanley, "Jewish Church," vol. 2. p. 135), he was profoundly unconscious of it. If it was "a dark legacy of hate" (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>) he was bequeathing to Solomon, then he stands before us in these last hours either as an unctuous hypocrite, or as infatuated and inconsistent to the last degree. That the man who, in his opening words (ver. 3), enjoined upon his son, in the most emphatic manner, a strict and literal obedience to the law of Heaven, should in these subsequent words, delivered almost in the same breath, require him to satiate a long-cherished and cruel revenge upon Joab and Shimei (the latter of whom he had twice delivered from death), is an instance of self contradiction which is almost, if not quite, without parallel. But as I have showed elsewhere, at some length, it is a superficial and entirely erroneous view of David's last words, which supposes them to have been inspired by malice or cruelty. His absorbing idea was clearly this, that he had not "kept the charge of the Lord;" that he, the chief magistrate, the "revenger to execute wrath," by sparing Joab and Shimei, the murderer and the blasphemer, both of whose lives were forfeited to justice, had failed in his duty, had weakened the sanctions of law, and compromised the honour of the Most High. He is too old and too weak to execute the sentence of the law now, but for the safety of his people, for the security of his throne, it must be done, and therefore Solomon, who was under no obligation to spare the criminals his father had spared, must be required to do it. Of the Jewish king it might be said with a special propriety, <span class="accented">"Rex est lex loquens,"</span> and seldom has the voice of law spoken with greater dignity and fidelity than by David in this dying charge. To say, as Harwood does, (Lange, American Trans., p. 32) that "nothing but sophistry can justify his [David's] charge to Solomon, not to let the unfortunate man [Shimei] die in peace," merely shows how imperfectly the writer has entered into the spirit of the theocratic law, that law under which David lived, and by which alone he could be governed and govern others. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David's Last Instructions and Death. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-1.htm">1 Kings 2:1-4</a>. When David saw that his life was drawing to a close, he first of all admonished his son Solomon to be valiant in the observance of the commandments of God. "I go the way of all the world" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-14.htm">Joshua 23:14</a>), i.e., the way of death; "be strong and be a man," - not "bear my departure bravely," as Thenius supposes, but prove thyself brave (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-9.htm">1 Samuel 4:9</a>) to keep the commandments of the Lord. Just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-9.htm">1 Samuel 4:9</a> the object in which the bravery is to show itself is appended simply by the copula Vv; so is it here also with &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;.

This is afterwards more fully expanded in the expression &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, to keep the ordinances, commandments, rights, and testimonies of Jehovah.
