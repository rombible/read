David could not—probably since Joab’s knowledge of his great crime, he dared not—punish him as he deserved. There is a graphic vividness in the description of the blood of his victims, shed as “the blood of war in peace,” spirting over the girdle and sandals of the murderer, which shows how the horror of the crimes had dwelt on David’s imagination. The murder of Abner, treacherous as it was, probably had some show of justification in the rough justice wrought out by the duty laid in ancient law on the “avenger of blood.” David disclaims it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/3-28.htm" title="And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:">2Samuel 3:28-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/3-37.htm" title="For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.">2Samuel 3:37-39</a>), without actually condemning it as inexcusable. The more recent and shameful murder of Amasa was simply one of revenge and ambition, because Amasa had been put in Joab’s place; yet David, broken in spirit, does not dare to blame it, and quietly acquiesces in the resumption by Joab of the dignity conferred on the murdered man. That these crimes should be punished by a king whose hands were clean, and who owed Joab nothing. was perhaps just, certainly within the letter of the law; though clemency might have spared the old and now fallen warrior, who had at least served David ably with long and faithful service. It is singularly true to nature, that the old King makes no mention of the act for which nevertheless, in all probability, he most bore grudge against Joab—the reckless slaughter of Absalom against his own express commands and entreaties—and does not deign to allude to his recent treason, which probably had already embittered Solomon against him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-5.htm" title="Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.">1 Kings 2:5</a></span>. <span class="ital">Moreover, thou knowest, </span>&c. — After David had given Solomon this general charge, he proceeded to direct him to do some particular acts of justice and kindness, and first of all, bids him remember how Joab had acted. We must not look upon this admonition of David, on his death-bed, as proceeding from a spirit of <span class="ital">private revenge, </span>but as advising the execution of a public piece of justice which the circumstances of things would not permit him to inflict before. Certainly the punishment of Joab was owing both to God and man, for his treacherous and cruel murder of Abner and Amasa; and, therefore, David here, in justice to his people, and the <span class="ital">divine laws, </span>ordered his son and successor to do that, when his throne was fully established, which he could not execute himself for want of sufficient power, Joab’s interest being then so great, that it might have thrown the state into a fresh civil war, had any steps been taken to inflict punishment upon him. <span class="ital">What Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me </span>— That is, <span class="ital">against me. </span>For Joab’s murder of Abner and Amasa was a great injury to David, as it was a breach of his laws and peace, a contempt of his person and government, a pernicious example to his subjects, and a great scandal to him, giving people reason to suspect that Joab had been only David’s instrument, to effect what he secretly designed. <span class="ital">And shed the blood of war in peace — </span>He slew them as if they had been in the state of war, when there was not only a cessation of arms, but also a treaty of peace. <span class="ital">And put the blood of war upon his girdle — </span>This is added to denote his impenitence, that although by his perfidious manner of killing them, when he pretended to embrace them, he stained his own garments with their blood, yet he was not ashamed of it, but gloried in it, and marched boldly along with the army, with the same girdle and shoes which were sprinkled with their blood.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:5-11 These dying counsels concerning Joab and Shimei, did not come from personal anger, but for the security of Solomon's throne, which was the murders he had committed, but would readily repeat them to carry any purpose; though long reprieved, he shall be reckoned with at last. Time does not wear out the guilt of any sin, particularly of murder. Concerning Shimei, Hold him not guiltless; do not think him any true friend to thee, or thy government, or fit to be trusted; he has no less malice now than he had then.

We must not expect Gospel morality from the saints of the Old Testament. They were only the best men of their several ages and nations. The maxim of "them of old time," whether Jews or Gentiles, was "Love your friends and hate your enemies" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-43.htm">Matthew 5:43</a>); and David perhaps was not in this respect in advance of his age. Joab's chief offence against David, besides his two murders, was no doubt his killing Absalom <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-14.htm">2 Samuel 18:14</a>. Another serious crime was his support of the treasonable attempt of Adonijah <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-7.htm">1 Kings 1:7</a>. But besides these flagrant misdemeanours, he seems to have offended David by a number of little acts. He was a constant thorn in his side. He treated him with scant respect, taking important steps without his orders <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-26.htm">2 Samuel 3:26</a>, remonstrating with him roughly and rudely <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-24.htm">2 Samuel 2:24-25</a>, almost betraying his secrets <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-19.htm">2 Samuel 11:19-21</a>, and, where he disliked the orders given him, disobeying them <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-6.htm">1 Chronicles 21:6</a>. David allowed his ascendancy, but he chafed against it, finding this "son of Zeruiah," in particular "too hard" for him (margin reference).<p>Put the blood of war upon his girdle ... - Meaning "The blood of Amasa spirited all over the girdle to which the sword of Joab was attached; and the sandals on his feet were reddened with the stains left by the falling corpse." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5, 6. thou knowest also what Joab &#8230; did&#8212;The insolent and imperious conduct of that general had not only been deeply offensive to the feelings (2Sa 18:5-15; 19:5-7), but calculated to bring reproach on the character, to injure the prospects, and endanger the throne of David.

The slaughter of Absalom, though neither mentioned here by David, nor afterwards by Solomon, when Joab is put to death, must have been constantly present to their minds.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto Abner the son of Ner</span>] Ner being brother of Kish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-36.htm" title="And his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab.">1 Chronicles 9:36</a>), the father of Saul, we can understand how Abner became a man of much importance in the court of Saul, under whom he was commander-in-chief. After the death of Saul it was Abner who proclaimed Ishbosheth and supported him against David, until some quarrel arising Abner made overtures to David which were favourably received. During the earlier events of the war between Ishbosheth’s supporters and those of David, Abner to save his own life had slain Asahel, Joab’s younger brother. To avenge this death and probably also from jealousy, lest Abner coming into David’s service should become more influential than himself, Joab calling Abner aside as he was departing from the court, in conjunction with Abishai his brother treacherously slew him. Owing to Abner’s early course of action David might have been suspected of conniving at his murder. The exposure to such a suspicion no doubt aggravated the king’s sorrow. David’s lament over Abner’s death is found <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/3-33.htm" title="And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dies?...">2 Samuel 3:33-34</a>. He never forgave the murder, though he was unable during his lifetime to take vengeance on the perpetrator.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto Amasa the son of Jether</span>] Amasa was a son of David’s sister Abigail, and the name of her husband is elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-25.htm" title="And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.">2 Samuel 17:25</a>) written ‘Ithra.’ Amasa took the side of Absalom when that prince rebelled against his father, but David forgave this, when Absalom had been slain by Joab, and appointed Amasa commander-in-chief in Joab’s place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-13.htm" title="And say you to Amasa, Are you not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if you be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.">2 Samuel 19:13</a>).

But this is just what David did not do; for he is careful to <span class="accented">exclude</span> all mention of his private wrongs. It is true, he says, "what Job did to me," but that is because "the sovereign is smitten in the subject" (Bp.

Amasa's mother, Abigail, was sister of David and Zeruiah; Amasa, consequently, was Joab's first cousin. This murder was even fouler than that of Abner.
