Those that show kindness to God's people shall have it remembered to their advantage. For this reason Solomon spares Abiathar's life, but dismisses him from his offices. In case of such sins as the blood of beasts would atone for, the altar was a refuge, but not in Joab's case. Solomon looks upward to God as the Author of peace, and forward to eternity as the perfection of it.

The repetition of &#1500;&#1493; in &#1493;&#1500;&#1493; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-22.htm">1 Kings 2:22</a>), for the purpose of linking on another clause, answers entirely to the emotional character of the words. "For him, and for Abiathar and Joab:" Solomon said this, because these two men of high rank had supported Adonijah's rebellion and wished to rule under his name. There is no ground for any such alterations of the text as Thenius proposes. - Although Abishag had been only David's nurse, in the eyes of the people she passed as his concubine; and among the Israelites, just as with the ancient Persians (Herod. iii. 68), taking possession of the harem of a deceased king was equivalent to an establishment of the claim to the throne (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-8.htm">2 Samuel 12:8</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-7.htm">2 Samuel 3:7-8</a>). According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21</a>, this cannot have been unknown even to Bathsheba; but as Adonijah's wily words had disarmed all suspicion, she may not have thought of this, or may perhaps have thought that Abishag was not to be reckoned as one of David's concubines, because David had not known her (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-4.htm">1 Kings 1:4</a>).</body></html>
