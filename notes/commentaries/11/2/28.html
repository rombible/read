Possibly this was done to bring Joab’s case within the emphatic declaration of the Law, that no sanctuary should protect the wilful and treacherous murderer, and that innocent blood, so shed and left unavenged, would pollute the land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-14.htm" title="But if a man come presumptuously on his neighbor, to slay him with guile; you shall take him from my altar, that he may die.">Exodus 21:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-33.htm" title="So you shall not pollute the land wherein you are: for blood it defiles the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.">Numbers 35:33</a>). It is significant, moreover, of the increased power of the monarchy, even in hands young and yet untried, that the old captain of the host, who had been “too hard” for David, even before David’s great sin, should now fall, as it would seem, without a single act of resistance or word of remonstrance on his behalf, after a long career of faithful service, only once tarnished by disloyalty. It has been noticed that if (as is probable) the “Tabernacle of the Lord” at Gibeon is meant, Joab falls close to the scene of his murder of Amasa, “at the great stone in Gibeon” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-18.htm" title="Then she spoke, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.">2Samuel 20:18</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-28.htm" title="Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom.

And Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-31.htm" title="And the king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall on him, and bury him; that you may take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.">1 Kings 2:31</a>) showed that the altar had better be stained with the blood of a murderer, than be polluted with his touch, in seeking an asylum from it, and thereby escaping the punishment which the divine laws required to be inflicted on him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:26-34 Solomon's words to Abiathar, and his silence, imply that some recent conspiracies had been entered into. Those that show kindness to God's people shall have it remembered to their advantage. For this reason Solomon spares Abiathar's life, but dismisses him from his offices. In case of such sins as the blood of beasts would atone for, the altar was a refuge, but not in Joab's case. Solomon looks upward to God as the Author of peace, and forward to eternity as the perfection of it. The Lord of peace himself gives us that peace which is everlasting.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Joab followed the example of Adonijab (margin reference).

Death, due to his great crimes (Nu 35:33), would long ago have been inflicted, had not his power and popularity with the army been too formidable for the old king. He now fled to the altar, which, though a recognized asylum, afforded no sanctuary to the rebel and murderer (Ex 21:14). And, as he refused to leave it, he seems to have cherished some faint hope that a religious scruple would have been felt at the thought of violating the sanctity of the place by bloodshed. Benaiah, not liking to assume any responsibility, referred the matter to Solomon, who determined that the law should take its course (De 19:13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Tidings came to Joab, </span> concerning Adonijah’s death, and Abiathar’s deposition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The tabernacle of the Lord</span> then was at Gibeon, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-4.htm" title="And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer on that altar.">1 Kings 3:4</a></span>, compared with <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-3.htm" title="So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.">2 Chronicles 1:3</a>,5</span>.

This crime, though never brought forward, no doubt instigated David to advise, and Solomon to provide that Joab should be taken out of the way.

This reading is perhaps too summarily dismissed by most commentators, as involving a statement which would be self evident and superfluous. But it is not so. The meaning would then be that Joab had inclined to Adonijah, and had not, subsequently, gone over to the side of Solomon - information which is much less obvious than that he had not "gone after Absalom." The Arabic version may thus be nearest the truth, which reads, "Neither did he love Solomon." Somewhat similarly Josephus.] <span class="cmt_word">And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord, and caught hold of the horns of the altar.</span> [As Adonijah had done before him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-50.htm">1 Kings 1:50</a>). His flight is almost certain evidence of his guilt. ("Joab vero seipsum prodidit." Munster.) Why should he flee, if conscious of innocence? Solomon had acted generously before, and Joab would not be aware of David's dying instructions. His two assassinations had remained so long unpunished that he would hardly expect to be called to an account for them now. We have here, therefore, another indication of a second conspiracy, and it is an old belief (Theodorot, <span class="accented">al.</span>) that Joab had suggested to Adonijah the plan of marriage with Abishag. Some have asked why Joab should flee to the altar when his crimes deprived him of the right of the sanctuary. But a drowning man grasps at a straw. It is probable that he never thought of his murders, but only of his treason. According to the Rabbis, death at the altar ensured him burial amongst his fathers (Munster). But, if this were so, it would hardly enter into his calculations. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To her request, "Let Abishag of Shunem be given to Adonijah thy brother for a wife" (&#1488;&#1514; &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;, cf. Ges. 143, 1, a.), which she regarded in her womanly simplicity as a very small one (&#1511;&#1496;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;), he replied with indignation, detecting at once the intrigues of Adonijah: "And why dost thou ask Abishag of Shunem for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom, for he is my elder brother; and indeed for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah." The repetition of &#1500;&#1493; in &#1493;&#1500;&#1493; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-22.htm">1 Kings 2:22</a>), for the purpose of linking on another clause, answers entirely to the emotional character of the words. "For him, and for Abiathar and Joab:" Solomon said this, because these two men of high rank had supported Adonijah's rebellion and wished to rule under his name. There is no ground for any such alterations of the text as Thenius proposes. - Although Abishag had been only David's nurse, in the eyes of the people she passed as his concubine; and among the Israelites, just as with the ancient Persians (Herod. iii. 68), taking possession of the harem of a deceased king was equivalent to an establishment of the claim to the throne (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-8.htm">2 Samuel 12:8</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-7.htm">2 Samuel 3:7-8</a>). According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21</a>, this cannot have been unknown even to Bathsheba; but as Adonijah's wily words had disarmed all suspicion, she may not have thought of this, or may perhaps have thought that Abishag was not to be reckoned as one of David's concubines, because David had not known her (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-4.htm">1 Kings 1:4</a>).</body></html>
