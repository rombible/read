It ill becomes a good man to prefer a bad request, or to appear in a bad cause. According to eastern customs it was plain that Adonijah sought to be king, by his asking for Abishag as his wife, and Solomon could not be safe while he lived.

The historian now relates the plot of Adonijah and its defeat. Foiled in his purpose to mount the throne by direct means, Adonijah and his advisers have recourse to intrigue and subtlety. By the aid of Abishag, he hopes to accomplish what his chariots and horsemen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5</a>) had failed to effect. And he first addresses himself to the queen mother (<span class="accented">"Aggreditur mulierem, ut regnandi ignaram ira amoribus facilem."</span> Grotius). The position of the queen dowager m the Hebrew kingdom was an influential one; not unlike that of the Valide sultana amongst the Ottomans. Hence the constant mention of each king's mother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-31.htm">1 Kings 14:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-10.htm">1 Kings 15:10</a>, where notice ver. 13; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-1.htm">2 Kings 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-1.htm">2 Kings 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-2.htm">2 Kings 14:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-2.htm">2 Kings 15:2</a>, etc.; hence, too, the part which such a queen mother as Athaliah found it possible to take. This pre-eminence was a natural result of the polygamy of Eastern sovereigns (and the consequent intrigues of the harem), coupled with the high estimation in which the mother was held in the East.] <span class="cmt_word">And she said, Comest thou peaceably.</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">Is it peace thy coming!</span> Bathsheba was evidently surprised by his visit. Owing to the part he had taken against her son, there would naturally have been but few dealings, if not positive alienation, between them. Her first thought, consequently, is, "What can this coming mean?" The prominence of the idea of <span class="accented">peace</span> in all Eastern salutations has often been noticed. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-4.htm">1 Samuel 16:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-22.htm">2 Kings 9:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-26.htm">2 Kings 4:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-21.htm">2 Kings 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-5.htm">Luke 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19-21</a>, etc.] <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Peaceably</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">peace.</span>] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>If the demands of justice required that Joab should be punished, the duty of gratitude was no less holy to the dying king. And Solomon was to show this to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and make them companions of his table; because Barzillai had supplied David with provisions on his flight from Absalom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-32.htm">2 Samuel 19:32</a>.). &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1504;&#1498; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497; &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;, "let them be among those eating of thy table;" i.e., not, "let them draw their food from the royal table," - for there was no particular distinction in this, as all the royal attendants at the court received their food from the royal kitchen, as an equivalent for the pay that was owing - but, "let them join in the meals at the royal table." The fact that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-10.htm">2 Samuel 9:10-11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-13.htm">2 Samuel 9:13</a>, we have &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1503; &#1488;&#1499;&#1500; to express this, makes no material difference. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-38.htm">2 Samuel 19:38</a>, Barzillai had, it is true, allowed only one son to follow the king to his court. "For so they drew near to me," i.e., they showed the kindness to me of supplying me with food; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a>, where Barzillai alone is named, though, as he was a man of eighty years old, he was certainly supported by his sons.</body></html>
