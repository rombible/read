It ill becomes a good man to prefer a bad request, or to appear in a bad cause. According to eastern customs it was plain that Adonijah sought to be king, by his asking for Abishag as his wife, and Solomon could not be safe while he lived. Ambitious, turbulent spirits commonly prepare death for themselves.

Adonijah &#8230; came to Bath-sheba&#8212;Her question to him betrays an apprehension which his recent conduct might well warrant; but his pious acknowledgment of the divine will seemed apparently to indicate so entire an acquiescence in the settlement of the succession [1Ki 2:15], that, in her womanly simplicity, she perceived not the deep cunning and evil design that was concealed under his request and readily undertook to promote his wishes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Deny me not, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">do not turn away my face</span>, i.e. do not send me out of thy presence sad or ashamed.
