It ill becomes a good man to prefer a bad request, or to appear in a bad cause. According to eastern customs it was plain that Adonijah sought to be king, by his asking for Abishag as his wife, and Solomon could not be safe while he lived. Ambitious, turbulent spirits commonly prepare death for themselves.

Adonijah &#8230; came to Bath-sheba&#8212;Her question to him betrays an apprehension which his recent conduct might well warrant; but his pious acknowledgment of the divine will seemed apparently to indicate so entire an acquiescence in the settlement of the succession [1Ki 2:15], that, in her womanly simplicity, she perceived not the deep cunning and evil design that was concealed under his request and readily undertook to promote his wishes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He said, moreover, I have something to say unto thee,....

He had cursed him with a vehement curse as he fled from Absalom (&#1504;&#1502;&#1512;&#1510;&#1514;, vehement, violent, not ill, heillos, from the primary meaning to be sick or ill, as Thenius supposes, since it cannot be shown that &#1502;&#1512;&#1509; has any such meaning); and when David returned to Jerusalem and Shimei fell at his feet, he had promised to spare his life, because he did not want to mar the joy at his reinstatement in his kingdom by an act of punishment (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-19.htm">2 Samuel 19:19-24</a>), and therefore had personally forgiven him. But the insult which Shimei had offered in his person to the anointed of the Lord, as king and representative of the rights of God, he could not forgive. The instruction given to his successor (&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, let him not be guiltless) did not spring from personal revenge, but was the duty of the king as judge and administrator of the divine right.<p>(Note: "Shimei is and remains rather a proof of David's magnanimity than of vengeance. It was not a little thing to tolerate the miscreant in his immediate neighbourhood for his whole life long (not even banishment being thought of). And if under the following reign also he had been allowed to end his days in peace (which had never been promised him), this would have been a kindness which would have furnished an example of unpunished crimes that might easily have been abused." This is the verdict of J. J. Hess in his Geschichte Davids, ii. p. 221.)<p>It follows from the expression &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498;, with thee, i.e., in thy neighbourhood, that Shimei was living at that time in Jerusalem (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-36.htm">1 Kings 2:36</a>).</body></html>
