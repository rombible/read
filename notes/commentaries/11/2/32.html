Those that show kindness to God's people shall have it remembered to their advantage. For this reason Solomon spares Abiathar's life, but dismisses him from his offices. In case of such sins as the blood of beasts would atone for, the altar was a refuge, but not in Joab's case. Solomon looks upward to God as the Author of peace, and forward to eternity as the perfection of it.

Death, due to his great crimes (Nu 35:33), would long ago have been inflicted, had not his power and popularity with the army been too formidable for the old king. He now fled to the altar, which, though a recognized asylum, afforded no sanctuary to the rebel and murderer (Ex 21:14). And, as he refused to leave it, he seems to have cherished some faint hope that a religious scruple would have been felt at the thought of violating the sanctity of the place by bloodshed. Benaiah, not liking to assume any responsibility, referred the matter to Solomon, who determined that the law should take its course (De 19:13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">His blood, </span> i.e. the guilt of the blood which he shed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">More righteous and better than he; </span> of more ingenuous and generous tempers, abhorring from all such treacherous practices; and both of them then devoted to and employed in my service. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord shall return his blood upon his own head,.... By way of retaliation, blood for blood: <p>who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he; later named; for though they had been in open rebellion against David, yet had submitted, and were reconciled and received into favour; and even their open crimes were not so bad, Solomon judged, as his secret treacherous murders of innocent persons in cool blood; they were men of more honour and integrity than he was, not so cruel and barbarous, though guilty in other respects: <p>and slew them with the sword, my father not knowing thereof; this is observed to remove all suspicion, and which doubtless had been entertained by some, that David had an hand in their death; and that Joab did what he did with his knowledge and consent, and by his advice and order; they having been both concerned in rebellion against him, the one under Ishbosheth, and the other under Absalom: <p>to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah: the reason of the two hosts, of which they were captains or generals, being thus distinguished, is, because the tribes of Israel were on the side of Ishbosheth, whose general Abner was, in opposition to Judah, who made David their king; and, on the other hand, they were the men of Judah that were first and chiefly in the rebellion of Absalom, whose general Amasa was; of the murder of these two men by Joab, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_kings/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">32</span>. <span class="ital">his blood</span>] i.e. The blood which he hath shed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">my father David not knowing</span> thereof] The verb is a finite tense and not a participle, and the clause may therefore be rendered ‘and my father D. <span class="bld">knew it not</span>.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Abner</span>] See notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-5.htm" title="Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.">1 Kings 2:5</a> above. In that verse both Abner and Amasa are called captains of the host of Israel, while here the latter is distinguished as captain of the host of Judah.

Abiathar had also forfeited his life through the part he took in Adonijah's conspiracy; but Solomon simply sent him to Anathoth (i.e., Anata; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-24.htm">Joshua 18:24</a>), to his own fields, i.e., to his property there, telling him, "Thou art indeed a man of death," i.e., thou hast deserved to die, "but I will not put thee to death to-day, because thou hast borne the ark of Jehovah," namely, both on the occasion of its solemn conveyance to Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-11.htm">1 Chronicles 15:11</a>.) and also on David's flight from Absalom (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-29.htm">2 Samuel 15:29</a>), that is to say, because of his high-priestly dignity, and because thou didst endure all that my father endured, i.e., thou didst share all his afflictions and sufferings, both in the period of Saul's persecution (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-20.htm">1 Samuel 22:20</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-8.htm">1 Samuel 23:8</a>.), and during the rebellion of Absalom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24</a>.). &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; (to-day) puts a limit upon the pardon, because Solomon could not foresee whether Abiathar would always keep quiet, and not forfeit his life again by fresh crimes.<p>(Note: There is no meaning in the objection of Thenius, that Abiathar did not carry the ark himself, since this was not the duty of the high priest. For, in the first place, it is questionable whether Abiathar did not lend a helping hand at the removal of the ark during Absalom's conspiracy. And, secondly, the duty binding upon the high priest, to superintend and conduct the removal of the ark, might very well be called carrying the ark. The conjecture, that for &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; we should read &#1488;&#1508;&#1493;&#1491;, founders on the preterite &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;; for Abiathar had not only worn the ephod once before, but he wore it till the very hour in which Solomon deposed him from his office.)</body></html>
