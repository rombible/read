Probably, as in the appointment of Saul and David himself, the right to anoint was recognised as belonging to the prophetic order (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-16.htm" title="And Jehu the son of Nimshi shall you anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shall you anoint to be prophet in your room.">1Kings 19:16</a>), inasmuch as it signified the outpouring of the Holy Spirit of the Lord. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-38.htm" title="How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.">Acts 10:38</a>.) Hence, in the absence of Nathan, it could not be attempted. In the case of David, such anointing had marked (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-13.htm" title="Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the middle of his brothers: and the Spirit of the LORD came on David from that day forward.

The “riding on the King’s mule,” attended by the body-guard, marked the royal sanction; the anointing, the sanction of priest and prophet; and the acclamation the adhesion of the people. Then are to follow the enthronement and homage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-34.htm" title="And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow you with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.">1 Kings 1:34</a></span>. <span class="ital">Let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him — </span>That is, say the Jews, one of them poured out the oil, and the other anointed his head, drawing a circle round about it with oil, according to their maxim that their kings were anointed in the form of a crown, to denote their delegation to the royal dignity. It is of more importance to observe, that this unction signified not only the designation of the person anointed to his office, but the gifts and graces which were necessary to qualify him for it, and which, seeking them sincerely of God, he might expect to receive. “We do not find,” says Henry, “that Abiathar pretended to anoint Adonijah: he was made king by a feast, not by unction.

Every true Israelite rejoices in the exaltation of the Son of David. Combinations formed upon evil principles will soon be dissolved, when self-interest calls another way. How can those who do evil deeds expect to have good tidings? Adonijah had despised Solomon, but soon dreaded him. We see here, as in a glass, Jesus, the Son of David and the Son of God, exalted to the throne of glory, notwithstanding all his enemies. His kingdom is far greater than that of his father David, and therein all the true people of God cordially rejoice. The prosperity of his cause is vexation and terror to his enemies. No horns of the altar, nor forms of godliness, nor pretences to religion, can profit those who will not submit to His authority, and accept of his salvation; and if their submission be hypocritical, they shall perish without remedy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Anoint him - Inauguration into each of the three offices (those of prophet, priest, and king) typical of the Messiah or Anointed One, was by anointing with oil. Divine appointment had already instituted the rite in connection with the kingly office <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>; but after Solomon we have no express mention of the anointing of kings, except in the three cases of Jehu, Joash, and Jehoahaz <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-6.htm">2 Kings 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-12.htm">2 Kings 11:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30</a>, who were all appointed irregularly.

We only read of its being done on some very marked occasions. Thus Saul, the first king, was anointed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-1.htm" title="Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD has anointed you to be captain over his inheritance?">1 Samuel 10:1</a>), and David, the king of God’s own choice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-13.htm" title="Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the middle of his brothers: and the Spirit of the LORD came on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.">1 Samuel 16:13</a>); also when God orders the prophet Elijah to make provision for a new succession in Israel, Jehu is to be anointed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-16.htm" title="And Jehu the son of Nimshi shall you anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shall you anoint to be prophet in your room.">1 Kings 19:16</a>), which was done when the proper time came (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-3.htm" title="Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus said the LORD, I have anointed you king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.">2 Kings 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-6.htm" title="And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed you king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel.">2 Kings 9:6</a>); so Joash after his preservation was anointed by Jehoiada (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-11.htm" title="Then they brought out the king's son, and put on him the crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.">2 Chronicles 23:11</a>). But though unmentioned it may have been performed in other cases. For ‘anointing’ is mentioned even in Jotham’s parable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-8.htm" title="The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive tree, Reign you over us.">Jdg 9:8</a>), where the trees will choose them a king. The ceremony is intended to symbolize the outpouring of gifts from above upon the new monarch.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">blow ye with the trumpet</span>] Thus did Jehu’s companions after his anointing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-13.htm" title="Then they hurried, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.">2 Kings 9:13</a>); neither anointing nor the blowing of the trumpets has been mentioned in connexion with Adonijah’s faction. No doubt they wished to gain strength before making such a public display of what they were doing.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet</span> [Bahr sees in the fact that Nathan was associated with Zadok in the anointing, "the high significance David attributed to the prophetic office in Israel" But the prophets constantly performed this ceremony. Samuel anointed both Saul and David; Elisha anointed Jehu (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-1.htm">2 Kings 9:1</a>), and was commissioned to anoint Hazael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-15.htm">1 Kings 19:15, 16</a>) ] anoint him [the king, being a sacred personage, was set apart to the office, like the priest and prophet, by anointing. Saul was probably anointed twice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-15.htm">1 Samuel 11:15</a>. Cf. 12:3). David was anointed thrice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>. Solomon was anointed twice (ver. 39; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-22.htm">1 Chronicles 29:22</a>). The Rabbins have always held that subsequent kings were not anointed, where the succession was regular. But this opinion must be taken <span class="accented">quantum valet.</span> It is true that we only <span class="accented">read</span> of the anointing of Jehu (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-6.htm">2 Kings 9:6</a>), Joash (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 2 Kings 11:12), and Jehoahaz (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 2 Kings 23:30), and that in these three cases the accession was irregular. But it is obvious that other kings may have been anointed as well, though the fact is not recorded. There would be no reason for recording it in ordinary cases It seems hardly likely, too, that any king would readily dispense with an ordinance which would so much strengthen his title] <span class="cmt_word">there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet</span> [the sound of the trumpet would almost seem to have been a necessary accompaniment of coronations, or the proclamation of a new king.
