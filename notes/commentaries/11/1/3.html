As Eusebius, describing its position carefully, calls it “Sulem,” and as this variation of name is confirmed by its ready identification with the modern village of <span class= "ital">Solam</span>, it has been conjectured (see Smith’s <span class= "ital">Dictionary of the Bible</span>, SHULAMITE), ingeniously and not improbably, that Abishag is the “fair Shulamite” of the Song of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-13.htm" title="And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.">1Kings 6:13</a>).

When Thenius, on the other hand, objects to this, for the purpose of throwing suspicion upon the passage, that the sentence is thus stamped as part of Aravnah's address to the king, and that in that case the words that follow, "and Aravnah said," would be altogether superfluous; the former remark is correct enough, for the words "all this giveth Aravnah ... to the king" must form part of what Aravnah said, inasmuch as the remark, "all this gave Aravnah to the king," if taken as the historian's own words, would be in most glaring contradiction to what follows, where the king is said to have bought the floor and the oxen from Aravnah. And the words that follow ("and Aravnah said") are not superfluous on that account, but simply indicate that Aravnah did not proceed to say the rest in the same breath, but added it after a short pause, as a word which did not directly bear upon the question put by the king. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; (and he said) is often repeated, where the same person continues speaking (see for example <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-4.htm">2 Samuel 15:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-25.htm">2 Samuel 15:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-27.htm">2 Samuel 15:27</a>).
