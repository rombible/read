Every true Israelite rejoices in the exaltation of the Son of David. Combinations formed upon evil principles will soon be dissolved, when self-interest calls another way. How can those who do evil deeds expect to have good tidings? Adonijah had despised Solomon, but soon dreaded him. We see here, as in a glass, Jesus, the Son of David and the Son of God, exalted to the throne of glory, notwithstanding all his enemies. His kingdom is far greater than that of his father David, and therein all the true people of God cordially rejoice. The prosperity of his cause is vexation and terror to his enemies. No horns of the altar, nor forms of godliness, nor pretences to religion, can profit those who will not submit to His authority, and accept of his salvation; and if their submission be hypocritical, they shall perish without remedy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jonathan had acted in a similar capacity, as a carrier of intelligence, in the time of Absalom's attempt <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-36.htm">2 Samuel 15:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-17.htm">2 Samuel 17:17</a>; but at that time, like his father, he was faithful to David, and "a valiant man," "a virtuous man," or "a man of worth." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-52.htm">1 Kings 1:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-4.htm">Proverbs 12:4</a>.) <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>41-49.

The arrival of a trusty messenger, who gave a full detail of the coronation ceremony [1Ki 1:43-48], spread dismay in their camp.

Jonathan had discharged the same office of watchman and newsbringer at the time of Absalom’s revolt.

The same word, which is often translated by ‘valour,’ ‘wealth,’ ‘might,’ is also used of any special excellence.

In the present case it was not so much a man of valour as of discretion who was needed in the messenger.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and bringest good tidings</span>] The expression is somewhat redundant in the Hebrew, and might be rendered ‘bringest good tidings of good’. The same words are thus translated <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-7.htm" title="How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him that brings good tidings, that publishes peace; that brings good tidings of good, that publishes salvation; that said to Zion, Your God reigns!">Isaiah 52:7</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest</span> [Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-36.htm">2 Samuel 15:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-17.htm">2 Samuel 17:17</a>.
