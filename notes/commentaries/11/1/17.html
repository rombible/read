Let me give thee counsel how to save thy own life, and the life of thy son. Such as this is the counsel Christ's ministers give us in his name, to give all diligence, not only that no man take our crown, Re 3:11, but that we save our lives, even the lives of our souls. David made a solemn declaration of his firm cleaving to his former resolution, that Solomon should be his successor. Even the recollection of the distresses from which the Lord redeemed him, increased his comfort, inspired his hopes, and animated him to his duty, under the decays of nature and the approach of death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bath-sheba bowed, like the woman of Tekoah <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-4.htm">2 Samuel 14:4</a>, with the humble prostration of a suppliant.

Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba &#8230; let me &#8230; give thee counsel, &c.&#8212;The revolt was defeated by this prophet, who, knowing the Lord's will (2Sa 7:12; 1Ch 22:9), felt himself bound, in accordance with his character and office, to take the lead in seeing it executed. Hitherto the succession of the Hebrew monarchy had not been settled. The Lord had reserved to Himself the right of nomination (De 17:15), which was acted upon in the appointments both of Saul and David; and in the case of the latter the rule was so far modified that his posterity were guaranteed the perpetual possession of the sovereignty (2Sa 7:12). This divine purpose was known throughout the kingdom; but no intimation had been made as to whether the right of inheritance was to belong to the oldest son. Adonijah, in common with the people generally, expected that this natural arrangement should be followed in the Hebrew kingdom as in all others. Nathan, who was aware of the old king's solemn promise to Solomon, and, moreover, that this promise was sanctioned by the divine will, saw that no time was to be lost. Fearing the effects of too sudden excitement in the king's feeble state, he arranged that Bath-sheba should go first to inform him of what was being transacted without the walls, and that he himself should follow to confirm her statement. The narrative here not only exhibits the vivid picture of a scene within the interior of a palace, but gives the impression that a great deal of Oriental state ceremonial had been established in the Hebrew court.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou swarest by the Lord thy God; </span> to whom thou art highly obliged, whose name thou justly fearest and honourest; and therefore thou wilt not pollute it by perjury, but make conscience of thy oath. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And she said unto him, my lord, thou swarest by the Lord thy God unto thine handmaid,....
