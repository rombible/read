Let me give thee counsel how to save thy own life, and the life of thy son. Such as this is the counsel Christ's ministers give us in his name, to give all diligence, not only that no man take our crown, Re 3:11, but that we save our lives, even the lives of our souls. David made a solemn declaration of his firm cleaving to his former resolution, that Solomon should be his successor. Even the recollection of the distresses from which the Lord redeemed him, increased his comfort, inspired his hopes, and animated him to his duty, under the decays of nature and the approach of death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Nathan came into the palace, not into the chamber, where he might not enter unannounced. Bath-sheba retired before Nathan entered, in accordance with Oriental ideas of propriety. So, when Bath-sheba was again sent for <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-28.htm">1 Kings 1:28</a>, Nathan retired (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-32.htm">1 Kings 1:32</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

Ewald, 188, b., p. 490), and, bowing low before him, communicated to him what Adonijah had taken in hand in opposition to his will and without his knowledge. The second &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; is not to be altered into &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, inasmuch as it is supported by the oldest codices and the Masora,<p>(Note: Kimchi says: "Plures scribae errant in hoc verbo, scribentes &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492; cum Aleph, quia sensui hoc conformius est; sed constat nobis ex correctis MSS et masora, scribendum esse &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1492; cum Ain." Hence both Norzi and Bruns have taken &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1492; under their protection.Compare de Rossi, variae lectt. ad h. l.)<p>although about two hundred codd. contain the latter reading. The repetition of &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; ("And now, behold, Adonijah has become king; and now, my lord king, thou knowest it not") may be explained from the energy with which Bathsheba speaks. "And Solomon thy servant he hath not invited" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-19.htm">1 Kings 1:19</a>). Bathsheba added this, not because she felt herself injured, but as a sign of Adonijah's feelings towards Solomon, which showed that he had reason to fear the worst if Adonijah should succeed in his usurpation of the throne. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-20.htm">1 Kings 1:20</a>, again, many codd. have &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; in the place of &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;; and Thenius, after his usual fashion, pronounces the former the "only correct" reading, because it is apparently a better one. But here also the appearance is deceptive. The antithesis to what Adonijah has already done is brought out quite suitably by &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;: Adonijah has made himself king, etc.; but thou my lord king must decide in the matter. "The eyes of all Israel are turned towards thee, to tell them who (whether Adonijah or Solomon) is to sit upon the throne after thee." "The decision of this question is in thy hand, for the people have not yet attached themselves to Adonijah, but are looking to thee, to see what thou wilt do; and they will follow thy judgment, if thou only hastenest to make Solomon king." - Seb. Schmidt. To secure this decision, Bathsheba refers again, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-21.htm">1 Kings 1:21</a>, to the fate which would await both herself and her son Solomon after the death of the king. They would be &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., guilty of a capital crime. "We should be punished as though guilty of high treason" (Clericus).</body></html>
