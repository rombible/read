The derivation seems to be from a root, meaning to “crawl,” or “steal on.” Some interpreters render, the “stone of the serpents;” the Targums make it “the rolling stone;” other authorities “the stone of the conduit,” which would suit well its position as here described.<p><span class= "bld">En-rogel.</span>—“The spring of the fuller.” (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-7.htm" title="And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel:">Joshua 15:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-16.htm" title="And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel,">Joshua 18:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-17.htm" title="Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.">2Samuel 17:17</a>.)

Large blocks of stone always attract attention in the East, and receive names which are often drawn from some trivial circumstance. Sinai and Palestine are full of such "Hajars," which correspond to the "Ebens" or "stones" of Holy Scripture.

En-rogel&#8212;situated (Jos 15:7-10) east of Jerusalem, in a level place, just below the junction of the valley of Hinnom with that of Jehoshaphat. It is a very deep well, measuring one hundred twenty-five feet in depth; the water is sweet, but not very cold, and it is at times quite full to overflowing. The Orientals are fond of enjoying festive repasts in the open air at places which command the advantage of shade, water, and verdure; and those fetes champetres are not cold collations, but magnificent entertainments, the animals being killed and dressed on the spot. Adonijah's feast at En-rogel was one of this Oriental description, and it was on a large scale (2Sa 3:4, 5; 5:14-16; 1Ch 14:1-7). At the accession of a new king there were sacrifices offered (1Sa 11:15). But on such an occasion it was no less customary to entertain the grandees of the kingdom and even the populace in a public manner (1Ch 12:23-40). There is the strongest probability that Adonijah's feast was purely political, to court popularity and secure a party to support his claim to the crown.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle; </span> partly for a sacrifice; and partly for feasts, that he might engage God to be on his side, and draw a multitude of people after him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By En-rogel, </span> or, <span class="ital">the fountain of Rogel, </span> or, <span class="ital">of the fuller</span>; a place nigh to Jerusalem: see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-7.htm" title="And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel:">Joshua 15:7</a> 18:16 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-17.htm" title="Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.">2 Samuel 17:17</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Called all his brethren the king’s sons; </span> either because he knew they envied and were discontented with Solomon, and therefore would favour him; or that he might engage them so to do. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">All the men of Judah the king’s servants; </span> except these here excepted, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-10.htm" title="But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.">1 Kings 1:10</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle,....

And here there was no doubt intended to be a certain solemnity connected with the feast held in honour of Adonijah’s proclamation. Beside its use in this chapter, where it is rendered ‘to slay’ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-19.htm" title="And he has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon your servant has he not called.">1 Kings 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-25.htm" title="For he is gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.">1 Kings 1:25</a>, the verb is only so translated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-21.htm" title="And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they did eat.

From the other places where it is mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-7.htm" title="And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel:">Joshua 15:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-16.htm" title="And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel,">Joshua 18:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-17.htm" title="Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.">2 Samuel 17:17</a>) it is clear that En-rogel lay on the south-east of Jerusalem, and formed one of the landmarks between the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. Attempts have been made to identify it with the ‘fountain of Job (or Joab),’ which is situate at the junction of the valleys of Kedron and Hinnom; while others are in favour of the ‘fountain of the Virgin,’ as it is now called, from whence comes the water to the pool of Siloam. It is in favour of the latter, that women still resort to it as a place for washing clothes. Of the ‘stone of Zoheleth’ we have no notice but in this passage.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Adonijah slew</span> [or sacrificed, LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>.

Perhaps "the spring of the spy." The Chald., Arab., and Syr. render "the spring, of the fuller" - the Orientals wash clothes, etc., by <span class="accented">treading</span> (rogel) them. Josephus says it was without the city, in the royal garden (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x1ff3;</span>). The authorities are divided between the "Fountain of the virgin" (Ain um ed-Deraj), and the "Well of Job" (Bir Eyub.) See the arguments in Bonar's "Land of Promise," App. 5; Thomson's "Land and Book," vol. 2 p. 528; and Mr. Grove's Art. in Smith's "Dict. Bib." Porter ("Handbook of Palestine ") identifies En-Rogel with Bir Eyub without remark. There is much to be said on either side. The pool of Siloam ("Bib. Museum") has nothing in its favour] <span class="cmt_word">and called all his</span> <span class="cmt_word">brethren the king's sons</span> [including, it would seem, even the elder sons of David and Bathsheba, who would bring up the number to fifteen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>).

The fierce jealousy between Ephraim and Judah would almost compel the king to surround himself with soldiers and attendants of the latter tribe. Some of the invited guests, no doubt, like Absalom's two hundred,  "went in their simplicity and knew not anything" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-11.htm">2 Samuel 15:11</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>They then looked about for a beautiful girl for this purpose, and found Abishag of Shunem, the present Sulem or Solam, at the south-eastern foot of the Duhy of Little Hermon (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-18.htm">Joshua 19:18</a>), who became the king's nurse and waited upon him. The further remark, "and the king knew her not," is not introduced either to indicate the impotence of David or to show that she did not become David's concubine, but simply to explain how it was that it could possibly occur to Adonijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-17.htm">1 Kings 2:17</a>) to ask for her as his wife. Moreover, the whole affair is to be judged according to the circumstances of the times, when there was nothing offensive in polygamy. </body></html>
