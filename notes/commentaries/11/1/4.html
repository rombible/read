Had it been otherwise, Adonijah could never have presumed to seek her in marriage, and Bathsheba would never have promised her help in his suit. Such an incestuous alliance would not only have been contrary to the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-8.htm">Leviticus 18:8</a>), but abhorrent to all true Israelites (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>). In this fact, which the court knew, and which the nation at large did not know - <span class="accented">they</span> could only suppose that such a "search" for one so exceeding "fair" meant the increase of the seraglio - Adoni-jah found his <span class="accented">point d'appui</span> for a second attempt on the throne. The older expositors and some of the modern, notably Wordsworth, assume that Abishag was David's wife, in the sense of being legally married to him. (Corn. A Lap. discusses the question at considerable length, and with needless pruriency.) But this idea finds no support in Scripture, which represents her as simply an attendant. It is idle to remark, consequently, that "the Jewish law allowed polygamy" (Rawlinson). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Aravnah replied, "Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold (i.e., there thou hast) the ox for the burnt-offering, and the threshing-machine, and the harness of the ox for wood" (i.e., for fuel). &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;, the pair of oxen yoked together in front of the threshing-machine. &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;, the wooden yokes. "All this giveth Aravnah, O king, to the king." &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; is a vocative, and is simply omitted by the lxx, Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic, because the translators regarded it as a nominative, which is quite unsuitable, as Aravnah was not a king. When Thenius, on the other hand, objects to this, for the purpose of throwing suspicion upon the passage, that the sentence is thus stamped as part of Aravnah's address to the king, and that in that case the words that follow, "and Aravnah said," would be altogether superfluous; the former remark is correct enough, for the words "all this giveth Aravnah ... to the king" must form part of what Aravnah said, inasmuch as the remark, "all this gave Aravnah to the king," if taken as the historian's own words, would be in most glaring contradiction to what follows, where the king is said to have bought the floor and the oxen from Aravnah. And the words that follow ("and Aravnah said") are not superfluous on that account, but simply indicate that Aravnah did not proceed to say the rest in the same breath, but added it after a short pause, as a word which did not directly bear upon the question put by the king. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; (and he said) is often repeated, where the same person continues speaking (see for example <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-4.htm">2 Samuel 15:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-25.htm">2 Samuel 15:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-27.htm">2 Samuel 15:27</a>).
