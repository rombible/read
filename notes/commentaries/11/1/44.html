Every true Israelite rejoices in the exaltation of the Son of David. Combinations formed upon evil principles will soon be dissolved, when self-interest calls another way. How can those who do evil deeds expect to have good tidings? Adonijah had despised Solomon, but soon dreaded him. We see here, as in a glass, Jesus, the Son of David and the Son of God, exalted to the throne of glory, notwithstanding all his enemies. His kingdom is far greater than that of his father David, and therein all the true people of God cordially rejoice. The prosperity of his cause is vexation and terror to his enemies. No horns of the altar, nor forms of godliness, nor pretences to religion, can profit those who will not submit to His authority, and accept of his salvation; and if their submission be hypocritical, they shall perish without remedy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Verily - "Nay, but" (or, "Not so"). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>41-49. Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating&#8212;The loud shouts raised by the populace at the joyous proclamation at Gihon, and echoed by assembled thousands, from Zion to En-rogel, were easily heard at that distance by Adonijah and his confederates. The arrival of a trusty messenger, who gave a full detail of the coronation ceremony [1Ki 1:43-48], spread dismay in their camp. The wicked and ambitious plot they had assembled to execute was dissipated, and every one of the conspirators consulted his safety by flight.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king hath sent with him,....

On the Crethi and Plethi see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>. "The oil-horn out of the tent" (i.e., a vessel made of horn and containing oil) was no doubt one which held the holy anointing oil, with which the priests and the vessels of the sanctuary were anointed (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-22.htm">Exodus 30:22</a>.). The tent (&#1492;&#1488;&#1492;&#1500;), however, is not the tabernacle at Gibeon, but the tent set up by David for the ark of the covenant upon Mount Zion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>). For even though Zadok was appointed high priest at the tabernacle at Gibeon, and Abiathar, who held with Adonijah, at the ark of the covenant, the two high priests were not so unfriendly towards one another, that Zadok could not have obtained admission to the ark of the covenant in Abiathar's absence to fetch away the anointing oil. </body></html>
