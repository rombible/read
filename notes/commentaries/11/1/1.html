It marks the general conception of the unity of the whole history, but implies nothing of special connection of time or authorship with the books of Samuel. In fact, although these books are in some sense the continuation of the former, yet the narrative is hardly continuous. The history passes at once to the closing scene of David’s life, leaving a comparative blank in the period succeeding the restoration after the defeat of Absalom—a blank which is partly filled up in the later books (1 Chronicles 22-29).<p><span class= "bld">Stricken in years</span>—about seventy years old. Since “clothes” mean “bed-clothes,” the meaning is that the King was now too feeble to rise from his bed. His life began its responsibilities early; it had been hard and trying; and, as the history shows, not wholly free from self-indulgence. Hence, at no excessive age, its complete decrepitude.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-1.htm" title="Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he got no heat.">1 Kings 1:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now King David was old — </span>Being in the end of his seventieth year. <span class="ital">They covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat — </span>Which is not strange, considering he was a person who had been exercised with so many hardships in war, and with such tormenting cares, and fears, and sorrows for his own sins, (as divers of his psalms witness,) and for the sins and miseries of his children and people.

Commentary by Robert Jamieson   <p>CHAPTER 1<p>1Ki 1:1-4. Abishag Cherishes David in His Extreme Age.<p>1, 2. Now king David was old&#8212;He was in the seventieth year of his age (2Sa 5:4, 5). But the wear and tear of a military life, bodily fatigue, and mental care, had prematurely, if we may say it, exhausted the energies of David's strong constitution (1Sa 16:12). In modern Palestine and Egypt the people, owing to the heat of the climate, sleep each in a "separate" bed. They only depart from this practice for medical reasons (Ec 4:11). The expedient recommended by David's physicians is the regimen still prescribed in similar cases in the East, particularly among the Arab population, not simply to give heat, but "to cherish," as they are aware that the inhalation of young breath will give new life and vigor to the worn-out frame. The fact of the health of the young and healthier person being, as it were, stolen to support that of the more aged and sickly is well established among the medical faculty. And hence the prescription for the aged king was made in a hygienic point of view for the prolongation of his valuable life, and not merely for the comfort to be derived from the natural warmth imparted to his withered frame [Porter, Tent and Khan]. The polygamy of the age and country may account for the introduction of this practice; and it is evident that Abishag was made a concubine or secondary wife to David (see on [282]1Ki 2:22).Abishag cherisheth David in his extreme age, <span class="bld"> 1Ki 1:1-4</span>. Adonijah usurpeth the kingdom, <span class="bld"> 1Ki 1:5-10</span>. By the counsel of Nathan to Bath-sheba, and their petition to David, he reneweth his oath of making Solomon king after him, <span class="bld"> 1Ki 1:11-31</span>. He, by David's appointment, is anointed king; the people triumph, <span class="bld"> 1Ki 1:32-40</span>. Adonijah hearing this, his guests flee, and himself fleeth to the horns of the altar; is pardoned by Solomon, and sent to his own house, <span class="bld"> 1Ki 1:41-53</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">Stricken in years; </span> Being in the end of his seventieth year. <span class="bld">He gat no heat; </span> which is not strange in a person not only of so great an age, but also who had been exercised with so many hardships in war, and with such tormenting cares, and fears, and sorrows, for his own sins, (as divers of his Psalms witness,) and for the sins and miseries of his children and people. See <span class="bld"> Pro 17:22</span>. Besides, this might be from the nature of his disease, or bodily distemper. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now King David was old, and stricken in years,.... Was seventy years of age; for he was thirty years of age when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4</a>; this was just the age of man, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>; <p>and they covered him with clothes; not wearing apparel, but bed clothes; he seems to have been bedridden and paralytic: <p>but he got no heat; by them; having no natural heat in him, clothes could not communicate any to him, only keep the cold from him, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-6.htm">Haggai 1:6</a>; there are many persons at the age he was, that are lively, healthful, and robust, comparatively speaking at least; but David's strength was impaired, and his natural force abated by his many wars, fatigues by night and day in campaigns, and the many sorrows and afflictions he met with from his family and his friends, as well as enemies; which exhausted his natural moisture, weakened his nerves, and drank up his spirits, and brought upon him the infirmities of a decrepit old age very soon. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now king David was <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> old <i>and</i> stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> heat.</span><p>The Argument - Because the children of God should expect no continual rest and quietness in this world, the Holy Spirit sets before our eyes in this book the variety and change of things, which came to the people of Israel from the death of David, Solomon, and the rest of the kings, to the death of Ahab. Declaring that flourishing kingdoms, unless they are preserved by God's protection, (who then favours them when his word is truly set forth, virtue esteemed, vice punished, and concord maintained) fall to decay and come to nothing as appears by the dividing of the kingdom under Rehoboam and Jeroboam, who were one people before and now by the just punishment of God were made two. Judah and Benjamin were under Rehoboam, and this was called the kingdom of Judah. The other ten tribes held with Jeroboam, and this was called the kingdom of Israel. The king of Judah had his throne in Jerusalem, and the king of Israel in Samaria, after it was built by Omri Ahab's father. Because our Saviour Christ according to the flesh, comes from the stock of David, the genealogy of the kings of Judah is here described, from Solomon to Joram the son of Jehoshaphat, who reigned over Judah in Jerusalem as Ahab did over Israel in Samaria.<p>(a) He was about 70 years old, 2Sa 5:4.<p>(b) For his natural heat was worn away with travels.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_kings/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>THE<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>FIRST BOOK OF THE KINGS,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>commonly called,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>THE THIRD BOOK OF THE KINGS<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/1-1.htm" title="Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he got no heat....">1 Kings 1:1-4</a>. David’s Feeble Age (Not in Chronicles)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">Now</span>] The Hebrew has only the conjunction usually rendered <span class="ital">And</span>. This sentence is not to be regarded as the commencement of a new history, but a continuation of what has been told in 2 Samuel. In Hebrew MSS. 1 and 2 Kings form but one book, as do also 1 and 2 Samuel , , 1 and 2 Chronicles. The division was first made in the LXX. which Jerome followed, and it was introduced in the printed Hebrew Bibles by Daniel Bomberg. The LXX. however treats these books as so closely connected with Samuel that the four books are all named alike (<span class="greekheb">βασιλείων α</span>. <span class="greekheb">β</span>. <span class="greekheb">γ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δ</span>.). They are so catalogued also in Origen’s list of the Canonical Books (Euseb. <span class="ital">H. E.</span> vi. 25), and in Jerome’s <span class="ital">Prologus Galeatus</span>. But we shall have occasion to point out some matters (e.g. the worship on the high places) which were viewed in a different light by the compiler of these later books from that in which they are regarded in the books of Samuel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The two books fall naturally into three sections. (1) The reign of Solomon, 1 Kings 1-11. (2) The history of two kingdoms after their separation, till the overthrow of the northern kingdom, 1 Kings 12 - 2 Kings 17. (3) The history of the kingdom of Judah from the Assyrian to the Babylonish Captivity, 2 Kings 18-25.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">king David was old</span>] The circumstances recorded in this passage must have happened when the feeble king had taken to his bed.
