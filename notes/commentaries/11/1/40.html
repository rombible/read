The graphic description of the acclamation of the people indicates something more than conventional loyalty. The attempt of Adonijah relied on the support only of the great men, and perhaps the army, but had no popular following.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:32-53 The people expressed great joy and satisfaction in the elevation of Solomon. Every true Israelite rejoices in the exaltation of the Son of David. Combinations formed upon evil principles will soon be dissolved, when self-interest calls another way. How can those who do evil deeds expect to have good tidings? Adonijah had despised Solomon, but soon dreaded him. We see here, as in a glass, Jesus, the Son of David and the Son of God, exalted to the throne of glory, notwithstanding all his enemies. His kingdom is far greater than that of his father David, and therein all the true people of God cordially rejoice. The prosperity of his cause is vexation and terror to his enemies. No horns of the altar, nor forms of godliness, nor pretences to religion, can profit those who will not submit to His authority, and accept of his salvation; and if their submission be hypocritical, they shall perish without remedy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Piped with pipes - Some prefer "danced with dances" - a meaning which the Hebrew would give by a change in the pointing, and the alteration of one letter.

But the objection loses its force when it is observed (Rawlinson) that the text implies that only <span class="accented">some</span> of the people piped. "<span class="accented">All</span> the people came up...  and <span class="accented">the people</span>," etc. Besides, even if it were not so, some allowance is surely to be made for Eastern hyperbole. And the received text is to be preferred on other grounds. The LXX., however, has <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>], <span class="cmt_word">and rejoiced with great joy</span> [Hebrews "were rejoicing a great joy"], <span class="cmt_word">and the earth rent</span> [this is certainly a strangly hyperbolical expression.

And Thenius suggests a slight emendation of the text, viz., <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "resounded") for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> which would obviate this difficulty.
