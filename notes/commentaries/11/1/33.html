The Targums here read <span class= "ital">Siloam</span>; and this agrees with the latter supposition, which is also supported by the proximity to Adonijah’s feast at En-rogel, implied in the narrative.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-33.htm" title="The king also said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:">1 Kings 1:33</a></span>. <span class="ital">Take with you the servants of your lord — </span>His constant guards, the Cherethites and Pelethites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-38.htm" title="So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride on king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.">1 Kings 1:38</a>. <span class="ital">Cause Solomon to ride upon mine own mule — </span>As a token that the royal dignity is transferred upon him, and that by my consent.

Then all the king's sons arose, and every man got him up on his mule, and fled.">2 Samuel 13:29</a>. And Absalom rode on a mule when he was hanged in the oak. But David had a mule peculiarly reserved for himself alone; on which Solomon’s being set, was considered as the beginning of his kingly power, no private person whatsoever being permitted to ride upon the king’s mule. “It was capital,” says Maimonides, “to ride on the king’s ass or mule, to sit upon his throne, or to handle his sceptre without his order.” On the contrary, it appears from the story of Mordecai, (Esther 6.,) that to have the honour to ride on the king’s beast by his appointment, was accounted the highest dignity among the Persians. <span class="ital">Bring him down to Gihon — </span>A little river or brook near Jerusalem, on the west side, which discharged itself into the brook Kidron, and in the Chaldee is called by its modern name, <span class="ital">Siloa. </span>If we may credit Maimonides, and other rabbis, the kings of the house of David were all obliged, to be anointed by the side of a fountain or river; which, they say, was the reason why David commanded his servants to bring his son down to Gihon, and anoint him there. Such a situation for anointing their kings, the Jews say, was chosen to show the perpetuity of their kingdom, because rivers run always, though the cities which they wash are continually decaying, and liable to destruction. But it is much more probable that this place was fixed on, because it was near Jerusalem, and a place of great resort, and capable of containing and displaying that numerous company, which David knew would follow Solomon thither. And being on the west side of the city, it was remote from Adonijah, who was inaugurated on the east side, and from his company, and therefore the people could assemble here without fear of tumults or bloodshed.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:32-53 The people expressed great joy and satisfaction in the elevation of Solomon. Every true Israelite rejoices in the exaltation of the Son of David. Combinations formed upon evil principles will soon be dissolved, when self-interest calls another way. How can those who do evil deeds expect to have good tidings? Adonijah had despised Solomon, but soon dreaded him. We see here, as in a glass, Jesus, the Son of David and the Son of God, exalted to the throne of glory, notwithstanding all his enemies. His kingdom is far greater than that of his father David, and therein all the true people of God cordially rejoice. The prosperity of his cause is vexation and terror to his enemies.

Meaning his own servants, his bodyguards, the Cherethites and Pelethites, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-38.htm">1 Kings 1:38</a>; the Jews (a) from hence gather, that a king is superior to an high priest, since David calls himself the lord of Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet: <p>and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule; for it seems on such a creature David used to ride, as did his sons; horses not being so common in Judea as they were afterwards. Some of the Jews (b) say it was not lawful to ride upon a mule, and that this case of David is to be excepted; for they pretend that this was a peculiar mule; and if the instance of his son urged, they reply, an argument from what kings and their sons used to do is of no force. Now this was one way of testifying that it was his will that Solomon should reign in his stead; for no private person might ride upon the beast the king was wont to ride on; this is now one of the Jewish canons (c), <p>"no one may ride on the king's horse, nor sit on his throne, nor use his sceptre:'' <p>and bring him down to Gihon; a fountain near Jerusalem, on the west side of it, which flowed from Mount Gihon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-30.htm">2 Chronicles 32:30</a>; the same with Siloah according to the Targum, of which mention is made, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-7.htm">John 9:7</a>. The reason for this order is not easily given; whether it was to denote the peaceableness and gentleness of Solomon's government, the waters of Shiloah moving softly, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-6.htm">Isaiah 8:6</a>, or the spread, constancy, firmness, and perpetuity of it, as the Jews say (d), since the water of a fountain is ever running; or because there might be a concourse of people there, and so he would be anointed and proclaimed king in a public manner, and be attended to the city with great pomp and solemnity. <p>(a) Bemidbar Rabba, sect. 6. fol. 186. 3.((b) Vid.

So they made him ride in his chariot.">2 Kings 10:16</a>) into Jehu’s chariot, and Haman named as a special mark of honour that a man should be set on ‘the horse that the king rideth upon’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/6-8.htm" title="Let the royal apparel be brought which the king uses to wear, and the horse that the king rides on, and the crown royal which is set on his head:">Esther 6:8</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">bring him down to Gihon</span>] From the direction here given this place must have been in the lower ground near Jerusalem. This agrees with the mention made of it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-14.htm" title="Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.">2 Chronicles 33:14</a>, where it is said to be in the valley, by which word is probably meant the torrent bed of the brook Kedron, so that Gihon would be in the Valley of Jehoshaphat on the east of Jerusalem.

Does this indicate that there was some purification connected with the act? At a later period there was an ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ pool at Gihon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-30.htm" title="This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David.

The populace would perceive at once who was destined to sit in David's seat. "The Rabbins tell us that it was death to ride on the king's mule without his permission" (Rawlinson). <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, the fem. form is only found here and in vers. 38, 44. The mule would seem to have been a recent importation into Palestine - we never read of them before the time of David - and the Israelites were forbidden to breed them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-19.htm">Leviticus 19:19</a>). Their use, consequently, was naturally restricted to royal or distinguished personages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-29.htm">2 Samuel 13:29</a>). Wordsworth sees in the word a proof that David had not disobeyed God by multiplying <span class="accented">horses</span> to himself], <span class="cmt_word">and bring him down to Gihon.</span> [Not Gibeon, which Thenius most arbitrarily would substitute for the received text. Where was Gihon? The popular belief (accepted by Bahr and Keil, as well as by some geographers) is that it was in the valley of the Son of Hinnom, a part of which still bears the name of Gihon, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to the west of Jerusalem, and not far from the Jaffa gate. By many indeed the present <span class="accented">Birket-es-Sultan</span> is identified with the Lower Pool of Gihon. But others (Ferguson, Rawlinson, etc.) see in it the ancient name of the Tyropaeon. Scripture does not speak of it as a <span class="accented">spring</span>, though the "source of the waters of Gihon" is mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-30.htm">2 Chronicles 32:30</a>, Hebrews The text shows that it was <span class="accented">below</span> the city ("bring him <span class="accented">down</span> upon Gihon," ver. 33. Cf. also ver. 40). <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-14.htm">2 Chronicles 33:14</a>, speaks of "Gihon in the valley," where it is very noticeable that the word used is <span class="accented">Nachal</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Wady, watercourse). But this "is the word always employed for the valley of the Kedron, east of Jerusalem, the so called valley of Jehoshaphat; <span class="accented">ge</span> (ravine or glen) being as constantly employed for the valley of Hinnom, south and west of the town" (Grove," Dict. Bible," art. Gihon). It is also to be noticed that the text last cited mentions Gihon in connection with Ophel, which lies southeast of Jerusalem.. The Chald., Arab., and Syr. are probably right, therefore, in identifying Gihon here with <span class="accented">Siloam</span> (which lies at the foot of Ophel), in favour of which it may further be said that it would be admirably suited for David's purpose - of a counter demonstration - and that whether En-Rogel is to be found at the Well of the Virgin or the Well of Job. Siloam is at no great distance from either, and quite within earshot, whereas the traditional Gihon is altogether out of the way. It must be borne in mind that this procession to and from Gihon was ordained, not because there was any special reason for anointing Solomon there ? for it was not a holy place - but purely as a demonstration to the populace, and to checkmate the conspirators. It was probably a public place, and would accommodate a large concourse (Poole). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>While Bathsheba was still speaking, Nathan came. When he was announced to the king, Bathsheba retired, just as afterwards Nathan went away when the king had Bathsheba called in again (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-28.htm">1 Kings 1:28</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-32.htm">1 Kings 1:32</a>). This was done, not to avoid the appearance of a mutual arrangement (Cler., Then., etc.), but for reasons of propriety, inasmuch as, in audiences granted by the king to his wife or one of his counsellors, no third person ought to be present unless the king required his attendance. Nathan confirmed Bathsheba's statement, commencing thus: "My lord king, thou hast really said, Adonijah shall be king after me...? for he has gone down to-day, and has prepared a feast, ... and they are eating and drinking before him, and saying, Long live king Adonijah!" And he then closed by asking, "Has this taken place on the part of my lord the king, and thou hast not shown thy servants (Nathan, Zadok, Benaiah, and Solomon) who is to sit upon the throne of my lord the king after him?" The indirect question introduced with &#1488;&#1501; is not merely an expression of modesty, but also of doubt, whether what had occurred had emanated from the king and he had not shown it to his servants.</body></html>
