This is another indication that the royal power had been greatly consolidated during the last peaceful years of David’s reign. Perhaps, moreover, the usurpation of Adonijah, not being viewed as a rebellion against David, but only a presumption on his favour, was accordingly crushed at once by the expression of his will. It is strange that of all the conspirators Adonijah alone seems to have feared punishment at this time; his accomplices, the other conspirators, are apparently allowed to disperse in safety, and their rebellion is ignored.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:32-53 The people expressed great joy and satisfaction in the elevation of Solomon. Every true Israelite rejoices in the exaltation of the Son of David. Combinations formed upon evil principles will soon be dissolved, when self-interest calls another way. How can those who do evil deeds expect to have good tidings? Adonijah had despised Solomon, but soon dreaded him. We see here, as in a glass, Jesus, the Son of David and the Son of God, exalted to the throne of glory, notwithstanding all his enemies. His kingdom is far greater than that of his father David, and therein all the true people of God cordially rejoice. The prosperity of his cause is vexation and terror to his enemies. No horns of the altar, nor forms of godliness, nor pretences to religion, can profit those who will not submit to His authority, and accept of his salvation; and if their submission be hypocritical, they shall perish without remedy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The king bowed himself - The king worshipped God and prayed that it might be so.

Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating&#8212;The loud shouts raised by the populace at the joyous proclamation at Gihon, and echoed by assembled thousands, from Zion to En-rogel, were easily heard at that distance by Adonijah and his confederates. The arrival of a trusty messenger, who gave a full detail of the coronation ceremony [1Ki 1:43-48], spread dismay in their camp. The wicked and ambitious plot they had assembled to execute was dissipated, and every one of the conspirators consulted his safety by flight.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. The way to his own house, lest they should be discovered and taken. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid,....

The repetition of &#1493;&#1490;&#1501; three times (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-46.htm">1 Kings 1:46-48</a>) gives emphasis to the words, since every new point which is introduced with &#1493;&#1490;&#1501; raises the thing higher and higher towards absolute certainty. The fact related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-47.htm">1 Kings 1:47</a> refers to the words of Benaiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-36.htm">1 Kings 1:36</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-37.htm">1 Kings 1:37</a>. The Chethib &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1498; is the correct reading, and the Keri &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; an unnecessary emendation. The prayer to God, with thanksgiving for the favour granted to him, was offered by David after the return of his anointed son Solomon to the royal palace; so that it ought strictly to have been mentioned after <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-40.htm">1 Kings 1:40</a>. The worship of grey-headed David upon the bed recalls to mind the worship of the patriarch Jacob after making known his last will (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-31.htm">Genesis 47:31</a>). </body></html>
