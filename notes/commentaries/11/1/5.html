From the words of Solomon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-22.htm" title="And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.">1Kings 2:22</a>, we may gather that he claimed the throne as being now the eldest son. Hence it is probable that Chileab (or Daniel, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-3.htm" title="And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;">2Samuel 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-1.htm" title="Now these were the sons of David, which were born to him in Hebron; the firstborn Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; the second Daniel, of Abigail the Carmelitess:">1Chronicles 3:1</a>), the second son, was dead, as well as Amnon and Absalom. The similarity between Adonijah and Absalom, in respect of personal beauty, favour with a too-indulgent father, ambition and trust in popularity, is evidently suggested by the narrative, which places them in close connection, although born of different mothers. The means, moreover, which Adonijah employed, the body-guard of fifty men, and the maintenance of “chariots and horsemen,” are exactly imitated from the example of Absalom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-1.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.">2Samuel 15:1</a>); and we note that the festal sacrifice, with the support of two important leaders in peace and war, recalls the same model. But Adonijah hardly shows the craft and ruthless determination of the elder rebel. His attempt on the crown seems crude and ill-planned in conception, and wanting in promptitude of action.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-5.htm" title="Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.">1 Kings 1:5</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then — </span>Upon notice of the desperateness of the king’s disease, and the approach of his death; <span class="ital">Adonijah exalted himself — </span>Entertained high thoughts and designs; <span class="ital">saying, I will be king — </span>As the right of the kingdom is mine, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-6.htm" title="And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why have you done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bore him after Absalom.">1 Kings 1:6</a>,) so I will now take possession of it. <span class="ital">And he prepared him chariots, </span>&c. — As Absalom had done upon the like occasion, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-1.htm" title="Samuel also said to Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint you to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore listen you to the voice of the words of the LORD.">1 Samuel 15:1</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:5-10 Indulgent parents are often chastised with disobedient children, who are anxious to possess their estates.

But even as it stands, it heightens considerably the picture drawn of the poor king's weak and helpless condition, of which Adonijah was not ashamed to take advantage for his own aggrandizement. Adonijah was born while David reigned at Hebron, and was therefore now between thirty-three and forty years of age. He was David's fourth son, but had probably become the eldest by the death of his three older brothers. He claimed the crown by right of primogeniture <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-15.htm">1 Kings 2:15</a>, and secretly to his partisans (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-10.htm">1 Kings 1:10</a>) announced his intention of assuming the sovereignty. It was well known to him, and perhaps to the Jews generally, that David intended to make Solomon his successor <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-13.htm">1 Kings 1:13</a>.<p>To run before him - That is, he assumed the same quasi-royal state as Absalom had done, when he contemplated rebellion <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ki 1:5-31.

Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself&#8212;Nothing is said as to the origin or rank of Haggith, so that it is probable she was not distinguished by family descent. Adonijah, though David's fourth son (2Sa 3:4; 1Ch 3:2), was now the oldest alive; and his personal attractions and manners (1Sa 9:2) not only recommended him to the leading men about court, but made him the favorite of his father, who, though seeing him assume an equipage becoming only the heir-presumptive to the throne (2Sa 15:1), said nothing; and his silence was considered by many, as well as by Adonijah, to be equivalent to an expression of consent. The sinking health of the king prompted him to take a decisive step in furtherance of his ambitious designs.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then, </span> on notice of the desperateness of the king’s disease, and the approach of his death, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Adonijah the son of Haggith</span> <span class="ital">{see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-4.htm" title="And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;">2 Samuel 3:4</a></span>}</span> exalted himself; entertained high thoughts and designs. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will be king; </span> as the right of the kingdom is mine, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-6.htm" title="And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why have you done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bore him after Absalom.">1 Kings 1:6</a></span>, so I will now take possession of it, lest, Solomon attempt to deprive me of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him, </span> as Absalom had done upon the like occasion, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-1.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.">2 Samuel 15:1</a></span>; such ill use did he make of that example, that he committed the same wickedness which he had done, and yet feared not the same disappointment and destruction which he brought upon himself. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself,....

It is true there was no "right of primogeniture" in the Hebrew monarchy. "The God King had reserved to Himself the choice of the earthly king" (Keil). David himself was not the eldest, but the youngest brother. At the same time primogeniture, <span class="accented">ceteris paribus</span>, would have, and as a matter of fact had, considerable weight. The firstborn had the birthright; can we doubt he would expect the crown, and think it hard if he were passed over?

Adonijah seems in every way to have imitated Absalom. Josephus says he resembled him in disposition. Chariots, horses, and outrunners are mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11</a>) as the very first of the king's insigina. Horses were such natural and familiar tokens of royal state (not being employed in agriculture or for travelling), that the Hebrew kings were warned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>) against multiplying them. Outrunners again, such as the Roman emperors had (called by them <span class="accented">cursores</span>), and such as we find at the present day in Egypt, <span class="accented">footmen</span> who precede the chariot at full speed, and by their shrill cries clear the way, are admirably calculated to impress the public mind. According to Morier, "runners before the king's horse in Persia are indispensable to the royal state." Adonijah hoped by this display of regal pomp to win the suffrages of the people.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The king did not accept the offer, however, but said, "No; but I will buy it of thee at a price, and will not offer burnt-offerings to the Lord my God without paying for them." Thus David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. Instead of this, the Chronicles give "shekels of gold, in weight six hundred." This difference cannot be reconciled by assuming that David paid his fifty shekels in gold coin, which would have been worth as much as six hundred shekels of silver, since gold was worth twelve times as much as silver. For there is nothing about gold shekels in our text; and the words of the Chronicles cannot be interpreted as meaning that the shekels of gold were worth six hundred shekels of silver. No other course is left, therefore, than to assume that the number must be corrupt in one of the texts. Apparently the statement in the Chronicles is the more correct of the two: for if we consider that Abraham paid four hundred shekels of silver for the site of a family burial-place, at a time when the land was very thinly populated, and therefore land must certainly have been much cheaper than it was in David's time, the small sum of fifty shekels of silver (about 6) appears much too low a price; and David would certainly pay at least fifty shekels of gold. But we are not warranted in any case in speaking of the statement in the Chronicles, as Thenius does, as "intentionally exaggerated." This style of criticism, which carries two kinds of weights and measure in its bag, explaining the high numbers in the books of Samuel and Kings as corruptions of the text, and those in the Chronicles as intentional exaggerations on the part of the chronicler, is sufficiently dealt with by the remark of Bertheau, that "this (i.e., the charge of exaggeration) could only be sustained if it were perfectly certain that the chronicler had our present text of the books of Samuel before him at the time." </body></html>
