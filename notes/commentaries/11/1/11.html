Such as this is the counsel Christ's ministers give us in his name, to give all diligence, not only that no man take our crown, Re 3:11, but that we save our lives, even the lives of our souls. David made a solemn declaration of his firm cleaving to his former resolution, that Solomon should be his successor. Even the recollection of the distresses from which the Lord redeemed him, increased his comfort, inspired his hopes, and animated him to his duty, under the decays of nature and the approach of death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The son of Haggith - Compare the margin reference.

Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba &#8230; let me &#8230; give thee counsel, &c.&#8212;The revolt was defeated by this prophet, who, knowing the Lord's will (2Sa 7:12; 1Ch 22:9), felt himself bound, in accordance with his character and office, to take the lead in seeing it executed. Hitherto the succession of the Hebrew monarchy had not been settled. The Lord had reserved to Himself the right of nomination (De 17:15), which was acted upon in the appointments both of Saul and David; and in the case of the latter the rule was so far modified that his posterity were guaranteed the perpetual possession of the sovereignty (2Sa 7:12). This divine purpose was known throughout the kingdom; but no intimation had been made as to whether the right of inheritance was to belong to the oldest son. Adonijah, in common with the people generally, expected that this natural arrangement should be followed in the Hebrew kingdom as in all others. Nathan, who was aware of the old king's solemn promise to Solomon, and, moreover, that this promise was sanctioned by the divine will, saw that no time was to be lost. Fearing the effects of too sudden excitement in the king's feeble state, he arranged that Bath-sheba should go first to inform him of what was being transacted without the walls, and that he himself should follow to confirm her statement. The narrative here not only exhibits the vivid picture of a scene within the interior of a palace, but gives the impression that a great deal of Oriental state ceremonial had been established in the Hebrew court.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Nathan</span> was prompted to this both by his piety in fulfilling the will of God declared to him, and by him to David, concerning Solomon’s succession, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-13.htm" title="He shall build an house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.">2 Samuel 7:13</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-8.htm" title="But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, You have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars: you shall not build an house to my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.">1 Chronicles 22:8</a>,9</span>; and by his prudence, as knowing that Adonijah hated him for being the principal instrument of Solomon’s advancement.

Although he was David's fourth son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-4.htm">2 Samuel 3:4</a>), yet after the death of Ammon and Absalom he was probably the eldest, as Chileab, David's second son, had most likely died when a child, since he is never mentioned again. Adonijah therefore thought that he had a claim to the throne (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-15.htm">1 Kings 2:15</a>), and wanted to secure it before his father's death. But in Israel, Jehovah, the God-King of His people, had reserved to Himself the choice of the earthly king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-15.htm">Deuteronomy 17:15</a>), and this right He exercised not only in the case of Saul and David, but in that of Solomon also. When He gave to David the promise that his seed should rule for ever (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>), He did not ensure the establishment of the throne to any one of his existing sons, but to him that would come out of his loins (i.e., to Solomon, who was not yet born); and after his birth He designated him through the prophet Nathan as the beloved of Jehovah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-24.htm">2 Samuel 12:24-25</a>). David discerned from this that the Lord had chosen Solomon to be his successor, and he gave to Bathsheba a promise on oath that Solomon should sit upon the throne (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-13.htm">1 Kings 1:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-30.htm">1 Kings 1:30</a>). This promise was also acknowledged in the presence of Nathan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-11.htm">1 Kings 1:11</a>.), and certainly came to Adonijah's ears. Adonijah said, "I will be king," and procured chariots and horsemen and fifty runners, as Absalom had done before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1</a>). &#1512;&#1499;&#1489;, in a collective sense, does not mean fighting or war chariots, but state carriages, like &#1502;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1</a>; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; are neither riding nor carriage horses, but riders to form an escort whenever he drove out.</body></html>
