He joined David after the death of Saul, and there were thus two priests, perhaps one being highpriest and the other second priest, through the whole of David’s reign. Zadok’s duties appear (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-39.htm" title="And Zadok the priest, and his brothers the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,">1 Chronicles 16:39</a>) to have been at the Tabernacle in Gibeon, and Abiathar had charge of the ark in Jerusalem. But in consequence of the events described in this chapter Abiathar was thrust out of his office and banished to Anathoth, and Zadok became the sole highpriest.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Benaiah the son of Jehoiada</span>] This man, though of the tribe of Levi, became captain of David’s body-guard of Cherethites and Pelethites (see below on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-38.htm" title="So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride on king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.">1 Kings 1:38</a>), and was made, when Joab was dead, commander in chief of Solomon’s army.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Nathan the prophet</span>] He was prominent in David’s reign, giving the king advice concerning the building of the Temple, bringing God’s rebuke after David’s adultery and the message of forgiveness when he had repented.

It is generally said to be difficult to explain "how Zadok and Abiathar came  both to be "priests at this time." Rawlinson, who adds that "the best explanation is that Abiathar was the real high priest," officiating in Zion, while Zadok acted as chief priest at the tabernacle at Gibeon. (Bahr, by a strange oversight, assigns to Zadok the care of the ark on Mount Zion, whereas <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-39.htm">1 Chronicles 16:39</a>, distinctly connects his ministry with the tabernacle of witness at Gibeon.) But the precedence (see on ver. 7) generally assigned to Zadok is hardly consistent with the idea that Abiathar was "the real high priest." The fact is that a duality of high priests, associated, apparently, on pretty equal terms, was not unknown in Jewish history. The cases of Eleazer and Ithamar, Hophni and Phinehas, Annas and Caiaphas, will occur to all. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a>, speaks of "the chief priest" and "the second priest;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-10.htm">2 Chronicles 31:10</a>, of the "chief priest of the house of Zadok." And a dual priesthood would be the more necessary in David's days, because of the two sanctuaries, Zion and Gibeon. We find, however, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-11.htm">1 Chronicles 15:11</a>, that Zadok was already priest at the time of the bringing up of the ark. And the true explanation, no doubt, is that Zadok had succeeded some member of his family, in all probability Jehoiada, called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-27.htm">1 Chronicles 12:27</a>, "the leader of Aaron" (Hebrews), who had certainly been high priest in the time of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-5.htm">1 Chronicles 27:5</a>), and who would hardly be degraded when, with 3700 followers, he joined David at Hebron. On his decease, or cession of orifice, Zadok, who had joined at the same time with a large contingent,was associated with Abiathar in the priest's office. This dual arrangement, consequently, was the result of David's having taken over a high priest from Saul, together with the kingdom, when he had Abiathar as priest already,] <span class="cmt_word">and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, Jehoiada the high priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-5.htm">1 Chronicles 27:5</a>). Benaiah was consequently a Levite, and of the family of Aaron; set, however, by David, because of his prowess (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-20.htm">2 Samuel 23:20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-22.htm">1 Chronicles 11:22</a>) over the bodyguard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-17.htm">1 Chronicles 18:17</a>).

This circumstance, which is a trivial one in itself, is only mentioned on account of what follows - first, because it shows that David had become too weak from age, and too destitute of energy, to be able to carry on the government any longer; and, secondly, because Adonijah the pretender afterwards forfeited his life through asking for Abishag in marriage. - The opening of our book, &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; (and the King), may be explained from the fact that the account which follows has been taken from a writing containing the earlier history of David, and that the author of these books retained the Vav cop. which he found there, for the purpose of showing at the outset that his work was a continuation of the books of Samuel. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; &#1494;&#1511;&#1503; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-1.htm">Joshua 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-1.htm">Joshua 23:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-1.htm">Genesis 24:1</a>, etc. "They covered him with clothes, and he did not get warm." It follows from this that the king was bedridden, or at least that when lying down he could no longer be kept warm with bed-clothes. &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; does not mean clothes to wear here, but large cloths, which were used as bed-clothes, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-6.htm">Numbers 4:6</a>. &#1497;&#1495;&#1501; is used impersonally, and derived from &#1495;&#1502;&#1501;, cf. Ewald, 193, b., and 138, b. As David was then in his seventieth year, this decrepitude was not the natural result of extreme old age, but the consequence of a sickly constitution, arising out of the hardships which he had endured in his agitated and restless life. The proposal of his servants, to restore the vital warmth which he had lost by bringing a virgin to lie with him, is recommended as an experiment by Galen (Method. medic. viii. 7). And it has been an acknowledged fact with physicians of all ages, that departing vitality may be preserved and strengthened by communicating the vital warmth of strong and youthful persons (compare Trusen, Sitten Gebruche u. Krankheiten der Hebrer, p. 257ff.).
