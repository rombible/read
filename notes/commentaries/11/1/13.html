And it is probable that Adonijah was not an entire stranger to what God had declared to Nathan and David on this subject: and if so, his crime was the greater in setting himself to oppose the decree of heaven. Indeed he acknowledges as much, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-15.htm" title="And he said, You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: however, the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD.">1 Kings 2:15</a>. <span class="ital">The king was very old — </span>And therefore, probably, could not see so as to discern who had entered the chamber till Abishag, who ministered unto him, informed him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:11-31 Observe Nathan's address to Bathsheba.

Such as this is the counsel Christ's ministers give us in his name, to give all diligence, not only that no man take our crown, Re 3:11, but that we save our lives, even the lives of our souls. David made a solemn declaration of his firm cleaving to his former resolution, that Solomon should be his successor. Even the recollection of the distresses from which the Lord redeemed him, increased his comfort, inspired his hopes, and animated him to his duty, under the decays of nature and the approach of death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It would have been in accordance with general Eastern custom for Solomon to suffer death, if Adonijah had succeeded in his attempt. But to have executed his mother also would have been an unusual severity. Still, such cases sometimes occurred: Cassander put to death Roxana, the widow of Alexander the Great, at the same time with her son, the young Alexander. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-27. Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba &#8230; let me &#8230; give thee counsel, &c.&#8212;The revolt was defeated by this prophet, who, knowing the Lord's will (2Sa 7:12; 1Ch 22:9), felt himself bound, in accordance with his character and office, to take the lead in seeing it executed. Hitherto the succession of the Hebrew monarchy had not been settled. The Lord had reserved to Himself the right of nomination (De 17:15), which was acted upon in the appointments both of Saul and David; and in the case of the latter the rule was so far modified that his posterity were guaranteed the perpetual possession of the sovereignty (2Sa 7:12). This divine purpose was known throughout the kingdom; but no intimation had been made as to whether the right of inheritance was to belong to the oldest son. Adonijah, in common with the people generally, expected that this natural arrangement should be followed in the Hebrew kingdom as in all others. Nathan, who was aware of the old king's solemn promise to Solomon, and, moreover, that this promise was sanctioned by the divine will, saw that no time was to be lost. Fearing the effects of too sudden excitement in the king's feeble state, he arranged that Bath-sheba should go first to inform him of what was being transacted without the walls, and that he himself should follow to confirm her statement. The narrative here not only exhibits the vivid picture of a scene within the interior of a palace, but gives the impression that a great deal of Oriental state ceremonial had been established in the Hebrew court.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Didst not thou swear, </span> i.e. Thou didst swear; which David himself owneth, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-30.htm" title="Even as I swore to you by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.">1 Kings 1:30</a></span>, which probably he did to satisfy Bath-sheba’s doubts and fears about it, and to oblige himself to a compliance with the Divine will declared about it. See <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-15.htm" title="And he said, You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: however, the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD.">1 Kings 2:15</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-5.htm" title="And of all my sons, (for the LORD has given me many sons,) he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.">1 Chronicles 28:5</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thine handmaid</span>; so she calleth herself, to testify her reverence and subjection to him, not only as her husband, but as her king. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He shall sit upon my throne; </span> another expression of the same thing, to signify David’s sincerity and fervency in his swearing, which adds to his obligation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Why then doth Adonijah reign?</span> how comes this to pass? or why dost thou suffer it? <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Go and get thee in unto King David,.... That is, go into the chamber where the king lay, at once, without any ceremony: <p>and say unto him, didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? though no mention is elsewhere made of such an oath, there undoubtedly was one, of which Nathan had knowledge, either from David or Bathsheba, or from them both, or might be present himself at the making of it; for not only Bathsheba affirms it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-17.htm">1 Kings 1:17</a>; but David owns it and confirms it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-30.htm">1 Kings 1:30</a>; <p>why then doth Adonijah reign? surely it cannot be with the king's knowledge and consent, so manifestly contrary to his promise and oath. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_kings/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">Didst not thou … swear unto thine handmaid</span>] She uses terms of great humility, even though she be pleading the king’s former solemn promise. We have no record of the oath to which Bath-sheba alludes, but we may be sure that the king had imparted to her the promise which God had made to him that Solomon should be his successor in the kingdom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Hebrew particle <span class="greekheb">כִּי</span>, which is here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-30.htm" title="Even as I swore to you by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.">1 Kings 1:30</a> translated ‘assuredly’, seems often not intended for anything more than a mark of quotation. Like the Greek <span class="greekheb">ὄτι</span>, when it stands before a direct quotation, it should be left in most cases untranslated. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-22.htm" title="Then Pharaoh said to him, But what have you lacked with me, that, behold, you seek to go to your own country? And he answered, Nothing: however, let me go in any wise.">1 Kings 11:22</a> it is rendered ‘but’, which would be better omitted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne</span>] The fuller phrase seems intended to imply that Solomon should be in all respects the equal of his father. The pronoun ‘he’ is emphatically expressed in the original as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-24.htm" title="And Nathan said, My lord, O king, have you said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?">1 Kings 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-30.htm" title="Even as I swore to you by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.">1 Kings 1:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-35.htm" title="Then you shall come up after him, that he may come and sit on my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.">1 Kings 1:35</a>.

Joab joined the pretender, because he had fallen out with David for a considerable time (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-5.htm">1 Kings 2:5-6</a>), and hoped to secure his influence with the new king if he helped him to obtain possession of the throne. But what induced Abiathar the high priest (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>) to join in conspiracy with Adonijah, we do not know. Possibly jealousy of Zadok, and the fear that under Solomon he might be thrown still more into the shade. For although Zadok was only high priest at the tabernacle at Gibeon, he appears to have taken the lead; as we may infer from the fact that he is always mentioned before Abiathar (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24</a>.). For we cannot imagine that Joab and Abiathar had supported Adonijah as having right on his side (Thenius), for the simple reason that Joab did not trouble himself about right, and for his own part shrank from no crime, when he thought that he had lost favour with the king.</body></html>
