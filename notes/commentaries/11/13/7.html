Such was the request of Naaman to Elisha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-15.htm" title="And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray you, take a blessing of your servant.">2Kings 5:15</a>), though even this was emphatically refused. But it still savours of astute policy in Jeroboam: for the acceptance of hospitality and reward would in the eyes of the people imply a condonation of the idolatrous worship, which might well destroy or extenuate the impression made by the prophet’s prediction. It indicates also—what experience of such men as “the old prophet” would have produced—a low idea of prophetic character and mission, not unlike that which is shown in Balak’s treatment of Balaam. That such conceptions are perfectly compatible with a certain belief in the reality of a supernatural power in the prophet—although they, of course, derogate from its true sacredness—the monstrous request of Simon Magus (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-19.htm" title="Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.">Acts 8:19</a>) shows with the most startling clearness. It was evidently to provide against these things—as fatal to the effectiveness of the prophet’s mission—that the prohibition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-9.htm" title="For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that you came.">1Kings 13:9</a> was given; nor could its general purpose have been easily misunderstood, either by the king or by the prophet himself. It is a curious coincidence that in his refusal he uses words strangely like the reluctant refusal of Balak’s offer by Balaam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-18.htm" title="And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.">Numbers 22:18</a>). The very strength of the language is suspicious.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/13-7.htm" title="And the king said to the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward....">1 Kings 13:7-9</a></span>. <span class="ital">I will give thee a reward — </span>He desires to requite the instrument, but takes no notice of God, the chief cause and author of this wonderful mercy. <span class="ital">The man of God said, I will not go in with thee, </span>&c. — In obedience to God, he refuses to eat, or drink, or have any familiar society with him, against whom he had pronounced God’s indignation. <span class="ital">For so it was charged me — </span>My refusal of thy favour is not from any contempt or hatred of thy person, but in compliance with the just command of my God, who hath forbidden me all further converse or communication with thee. <span class="ital">Saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water — </span>Namely, in that place, or with that people.

Idolatrous worship will not continue, but the word of the Lord will endure for ever. The prediction plainly declared that the family of David would continue, and support true religion, when the ten tribes would not be able to resist them. If God, in justice, harden the hearts of sinners, so that the hand they have stretched out in sin they cannot pull in again by repentance, that is a spiritual judgment, represented by this, and much more dreadful. Jeroboam looked for help, not from his calves, but from God only, from his power, and his favour. The time may come when those that hate the preaching, would be glad of the prayers of faithful ministers. Jeroboam does not desire the prophet to pray that his sin might be pardoned, and his heart changed, but only that his hand might be restored. He seemed affected for the present with both the judgment and the mercy, but the impression wore off. God forbade his messenger to eat or drink in Bethel, to show his detestation of their idolatry and apostacy from God, and to teach us not to have fellowship with the works of darkness. Those have not learned self-denial, who cannot forbear one forbidden meal.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will give thee a reward - It was customary to honor a prophet with a gift, if he performed any service that was requested at his hands (see the marginal references). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-9. he cried against the altar&#8212;which is put for the whole system of worship organized in Israel.<p>Behold, a child shall be born &#8230; Josiah by name&#8212;This is one of the most remarkable prophecies recorded in the Scriptures; and, in its clearness, circumstantial minuteness, and exact prediction of an event that took place three hundred sixty years later, it stands in striking contrast to the obscure and ambiguous oracles of the heathen. Being publicly uttered, it must have been well known to the people; and every Jew who lived at the accomplishment of the event must have been convinced of the truth of a religion connected with such a prophecy as this. A present sign was given of the remote event predicted, in a visible fissure being miraculously made on the altar. Incensed at the man's license of speech, Jeroboam stretched out his hand and ordered his attendants to seize the bold intruder. That moment the king's arm became stiff and motionless, and the altar split asunder, so that the fire and ashes fell on the floor. Overawed by the effects of his impiety, Jeroboam besought the prophet's prayer. His request was acceded to, and the hand was restored to its healthy state. Jeroboam was artful, and invited the prophet to the royal table, not to do him honor or show his gratitude for the restoration of his hand, but to win, by his courtesy and liberal hospitality, a person whom he could not crush by his power. But the prophet informed him of a divine injunction expressly prohibiting him from all social intercourse with any in the place, as well as from returning the same way. The prohibition not to eat or drink in Beth-el was because all the people had become apostates from the true religion, and the reason he was not allowed to return the same way was lest he should be recognized by any whom he had seen in going.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Horrid stupidity!</span> He desires to requite the instrument, but takes no notice of the chief cause and author of this great and wonderful mercy, which was God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king said unto the man of God, come home with me, and refresh thyself,....

He still went on in his evil way. But he would fain have the man of God continue in his company a while, that his people might not be terrified by what had happened and decide to break off from the calf-worship and go up to Jerusalem to the Temple again.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself</span> [with food, ablutions, etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-4.htm">Genesis 18:4, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-2.htm">Genesis 19:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-3.htm">Mark 7:3</a>, etc.) We are hardly justified in seeing in these words (with Bahr and Keil) an attempt to "gain the prophet over to his side by friendliness," and to render his threat harmless in the eyes of the people. The king doubtless may have hoped that it would "blunt the edge of the prophet's denunciation of his schismatical altar" (Wordsworth); but this was not the object, or not the sole object, with which the invitation was given. Jeroboam could not possibly have done less, after the signal service the man of God had rendered him, than invite him to his palace. Eastern courtesy alone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-4.htm">Genesis 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-2.htm">Genesis 19:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-24.htm">Genesis 43:24</a>, etc.) would require him to offer hospitality to his benefactor. And he could scarcely hope that any hospitalities would either neutralize the impression which the recent miracles had made, or win over to his side one who had a direct commission from the Most High to oppose him. With more reason, Wordsworth cites <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-30.htm">1 Samuel 15:30</a>,  "Honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people."

Whilst Jeroboam was still occupied in sacrificing by the altar at Bethel, there came a prophet (&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;) out of Judah "in the word of Jehovah" to Bethel, and pronounced upon the altar its eventual destruction. &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512; does not mean "at the word of Jehovah" here, as it frequently does, but "in the word of Jehovah," as <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-9.htm">1 Kings 13:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-17.htm">1 Kings 13:17</a> more especially show; so that the word of Jehovah is regarded as a power which comes upon the prophet and drives him to utter the divine revelation which he has received. It is the same in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-35.htm">1 Kings 20:35</a>. &#1500;&#1492;&#1511;&#1496;&#1497;&#1512; is to be taken as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-33.htm">1 Kings 12:33</a>. - "Behold a son will be born to the house of David, named Josiah; he will offer upon thee (O altar) the priests of the high places, who burn incense (i.e., kindle sacrifices) upon thee, and men's bones will they burn upon thee." According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-15.htm">2 Kings 23:15-20</a>, this prophecy was literally fulfilled. The older theologians found in this an evident proof of the divine inspiration of the prophets; modern theology, on the other hand, which denies the supernatural inspiration of prophecy in accordance with its rationalistic or naturalistic principles, supplies that this prophecy was not more precisely defined till after the event, and adduces in support of this the apparently just argument, that the prediction of particular historical events is without analogy, and generally that the introduction either of particular persons by name or of definite numbers is opposed to the very essence of prophecy, and turns prediction into soothsaying. The distinction between soothsaying and prediction, however, is not that the latter merely utters general ideas concerning the future, whilst the former announces special occurrences beforehand: but soothsaying is the foretelling of all kinds of accidental things; prophecy, on the contrary, the foretelling of the progressive development of the kingdom of God, not merely in general, but in its several details, according to the circumstances and necessities of each particular age, and that in such a manner that the several concrete details of the prophecy rest upon the general idea of the revelation of salvation, and are thereby entirely removed from the sphere of the accidental. It is true that perfectly concrete predictions of particular events, with the introduction of names and statement of times, are much more rare than the predictions of the progressive development of the kingdom of God according to its general features; but they are not altogether wanting, and we meet with them in every case where it was of importance to set before an ungodly generation in the most impressive manner the truth of the divine threatenings of promises. The allusion to Coresh in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>, is analogous to the announcement before us. But in both cases the names are closely connected with the destination of the persons in the prophecy, and are simply a concrete description of what God will accomplish through these men. Hence the name &#1497;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; occurs primarily according to its appellative meaning alone, viz., "he whom Jehovah supports," from &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, to support, and expresses this thought: there will be born a son to the house of David, whom Jehovah will support of establish, so that he shall execute judgment upon the priests of the high places at Bethel. This prophecy was then afterwards so fulfilled by the special arrangement of God, that the king who executed this judgment bore the name of Joshiyahu as his proper name. And so also &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; was originally an appellative in the sense of sun. The judgment which the prophet pronounced upon the altar was founded upon the jus talionis. On the very same altar on which the priests offer sacrifice to the &#1506;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; shall they themselves be offered, and the altar shall be defiled for ever by the burning of men's bones upon it. &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, "men's bones," does not stand for "their (the priests') bones," but is simply an epithet used to designate human corpses, which defile the place where they lie (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-16.htm">2 Kings 23:16</a>).</body></html>
