And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.">2 Kings 2:24</a>; and, it is not unlikely, that out of the same wood came the lion that slew this prophet. <span class="ital">His carcass was cast in the way </span>— His dead body fell to the ground, and lay in the place where the soul left it. <span class="ital">The lion also stood by the carcass — </span>Which plainly showed that he was sent by God to execute only what God had threatened, and not to move one step beyond that commission, otherwise, agreeable to his nature and fierceness, he would certainly have devoured the carcass and torn the ass. “Some have thought,” says Dr. Dodd, “that this prophet’s was a small offence to have met with so severe a punishment: but the true state of the case is this: the prophet from Judah had sufficient evidence of the truth of his own revelation; had sufficient cause to suspect some corrupt ends in the prophet who came to recall him; and had sufficient reason to expect, an interposition of the same power that gave him the injunction to repeal it; and, therefore, his crime was an easy credulity, a complying with an offer merely to gratify a petulant appetite, which he knew was repugnant to a divine command. It argued a great levity, if not infidelity, of his own revelation, to listen to the pretended one of another man.” It must be acknowledged, however, to be strange, that the lying prophet should escape, while he, who, notwithstanding this error, was truly a man of God, is so severely punished. <span class="ital">But judgment must begin at the house of God: </span>God must correct his own children first. And there is a judgment to come, when these things shall be called over again, and when those who sinned most and suffered least in this world, will receive according to their works. This punishment of the prophet was a very striking admonition to Jeroboam of what he might expect, since God spared not a less guilty offender. And we may all learn from God’s severity, in this instance, 1st, Not to suffer our faith to be perverted by any suggestions made against a revelation of uncontested divine authority; and, 2d, Always to pay a strict regard and obedience to all the known commands of God.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:23-34 God is displeased at the sins of his own people; and no man shall be protected in disobedience, by his office, his nearness to God, or any services he has done for him. God warns all whom he employs, strictly to observe their orders. We cannot judge of men by their sufferings, nor of sins by present punishments; with some, the flesh is destroyed, that the spirit may be saved; with others, the flesh is pampered, that the soul may ripen for hell. Jeroboam returned not from his evil way. He promised himself that the calves would secure the crown to his family, but they lost it, and sunk his family. Those betray themselves who think to support themselves by any sin whatever. Let us dread prospering in sinful ways; pray to be kept from every delusion and temptation, and to be enabled to walk with self-denying perseverance in the way of God's commands.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the anxiety of the Hebrews to be buried with their fathers, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-30.htm">Genesis 47:30</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-29.htm">Genesis 49:29</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-1.htm">Genesis 49:1</a>,<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-25.htm">Genesis 49:25</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-37.htm">2 Samuel 19:37</a>, etc. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ki 13:23-32.

The prophet of Judah is slain.

Instead of the concluding words of this verse ‘to wit, for &c. the LXX. has ‘and he turned and went away.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Because the word ‘prophet’ <span class="greekheb">נביא</span> is not used elsewhere in the story for the Judæan prophet, who is always called ‘a man of God,’ some have rendered the last part of this verse ‘he saddled for him the ass, the ass belonging to the prophet who had brought him back.’ But it seems far more natural to take the <span class="greekheb">לו</span> = <span class="ital">for</span> him, as in close relation to the <span class="greekheb">לנביא</span> = <span class="ital">for</span> the prophet, as they are both introduced by the same preposition.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the prophet of Bethel; the "man of God" would seem to have come on foot. See below] <span class="cmt_word">for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.</span> This translation is inadmissible. For not only is the term "prophet" throughout this narrative restricted to the prophet of Bethel (the prophet of Judah being always spoken of as "the man of God,") but the expression here used <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d4;</span> is also twice used (vers. 20, 26) of the same prophet. He is characterized there, that is to say, as "the prophet which brought him back;" it is hardly likely, therefore, that the same words are here to be interpreted, "the prophet whom he brought back." The mistake has arisen from the proximity of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> ("for him") to <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span> ("to" or "for the prophet"). But the <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>is here indicative of possession (the dative of the possessor), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-16.htm">1 Samuel 14:16</a>, "the watchmen to," <span class="accented">i.e., of</span>, "Saul," and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-18.htm">1 Samuel 16:18</a>, "a son to Jesse" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a> Heb.; 1 Kings 5:29 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>1 Kings 5:15<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span> Heb.; Ruth 2:3 Heb.) We must therefore render "He (the old prophet, but this is not absolutely certain; the "man of God" <span class="accented">may</span> be understood) saddled for him (the man of God) the ass of the prophet which brought him back." The man of God had been delayed by his return to Bethel, and the prophet, out of pity, lends or gives him his ass. Not merely, it is probable, for the sake of speeding him on his way, but that he might have some living thing with him on a journey which he had so much cause to dread. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Seduction of the man of God by an old prophet, and his consequent punishment. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-11.htm">1 Kings 13:11-19</a>. The man of God had resisted the invitations of Jeroboam, and set out by a different road to return to Judah. An old prophet at Bethel heard from his sons what had taken place (the singular &#1489;&#1504;&#1493; &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; as compared with the plural &#1493;&#1497;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; may be explained on the supposition that first of all one son related the matter to his father, and that then the other sons supported the account given by the first); had his ass saddled; hurried after him, and found him sitting under the terebinth (the tree well known from that event); invited him to come into his house and eat with him; and when the latter appealed to the divine prohibition, said to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-18.htm">1 Kings 13:18</a>), "I am a prophet also as thou art, and an angel has said to me in the word of the Lord: Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat and drink," and lied to him (&#1500;&#1493; &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473; without a copula, because it is inserted as it were parenthetically, simply as an explanation) - then he went back with him, and ate and drank in his house. </body></html>
