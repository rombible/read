Josephus, with his perverse tendency to explain away all that seems startling, misses this point entirely, and assigns the revelation to the prophet of Judah himself. Striking as this incident is, it is perhaps a symbol of a general law constantly exemplifying itself, that the voice of worldly wisdom first beguiles the servants of God to disobedience by false glosses on their duty to Him, and then proclaims unsparingly their sin and its just punishment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/13-20.htm" title="And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came to the prophet that brought him back:...">1 Kings 13:20-22</a></span>. <span class="ital">The word of the Lord came, </span>&c. — God obliged the prophet, who had caused him to sin, to denounce a punishment against him for it, that it might the more affect him; nothing being more piercing than to be reflected on by those who have caused us to err. <span class="ital">And he cried unto the man of God </span>— With a loud voice, the effect of his passion, both for his own guilt and shame, and for the prophet’s approaching misery. <span class="ital">Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the Lord — </span>That is, the word of command coming out of his mouth; <span class="ital">thy carcass shall not come into the sepulchre of thy fathers — </span>Thou shalt not die a natural, but a violent death, and that in this journey, before thou returnest to thy own habitation. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:11-22 The old prophet's conduct proves that he was not really a godly man. When the change took place under Jeroboam, he preferred his ease and interest to his religion. He took a very bad method to bring the good prophet back. It was all a lie. Believers are most in danger of being drawn from their duty by plausible pretences of holiness. We may wonder that the wicked prophet went unpunished, while the holy man of God was suddenly and severely punished. What shall we make of this? The judgments of God are beyond our power to fathom; and there is a judgment to come. Nothing can excuse any act of wilful disobedience. This shows what they must expect who hearken to the great deceiver. They that yield to him as a tempter, will be terrified by him as a tormentor. Those whom he now fawns upon, he will afterwards fly upon; and whom he draws into sin, he will try to drive to despair.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But he lied unto him - It is always to be remembered that the prophetic gift might co-exist with various degrees of moral imperfection in the person possessing it.

The "angel," that is, "messenger," was his own sons, who were worshippers, perhaps priests, at Beth-el. As this man was governed by self-interest, and wished to curry favor with the king (whose purpose to adhere to his religious polity, he feared, might be shaken by the portents that had occurred), his hastening after the prophet of Judah, the deception he practised, and the urgent invitation by which, on the ground of a falsehood, he prevailed on the too facile man of God to accompany him back to his house in Beth-el, were to create an impression in the king's mind that he was an impostor, who acted in opposition to his own statement.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">As they sat at the table; </span> there the prophet meets with a severe judgment, where he was pleasing himself with this seasonable refreshment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The word of the Lord came</span> by secret instinct into his mind, as sometimes God spake to Moses and other prophets when they were in company with others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Unto the prophet that brought him back; </span> so he makes this prophet publicly to call himself liar, and to pronounce a terrible sentence against him, to whom he professed so much kindness.

The old prophet, with his sons, and the man of God; the Arabic version adds, "and did eat", there being a pause in the Hebrew text, as if something was wanting, and to be understood and supplied: <p>that the word of the Lord came unto the prophet that brought him back; that is, to the old prophet, who was the means of bringing back the man of God; the word did not come to him who had transgressed the command of the Lord, but to him who was the occasion of it; though Abarbinel is of opinion that the word came to the latter, and so some versions, both ancient and modern, render the clause, "to the prophet whom he had brought back" (f) and which is countenanced by what is said, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-26.htm">1 Kings 13:26</a>, <p>according to the word of the Lord which he spoke unto him: but the former sense best agrees with what follows. <p>(f) Syr.
