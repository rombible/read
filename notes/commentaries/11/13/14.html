This expression is an evident mark of the antiquity of the document from which the history is taken. It has been suggested that the narrative implies a needless loitering of the prophet of Judah on the way. Taken by itself, it would not necessarily convey this; but in relation to the temper indicated in the whole story, the thing may be not improbable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-14.htm" title="And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said to him, Are you the man of God that came from Judah?

When the change took place under Jeroboam, he preferred his ease and interest to his religion. He took a very bad method to bring the good prophet back. It was all a lie. Believers are most in danger of being drawn from their duty by plausible pretences of holiness. We may wonder that the wicked prophet went unpunished, while the holy man of God was suddenly and severely punished. What shall we make of this? The judgments of God are beyond our power to fathom; and there is a judgment to come. Nothing can excuse any act of wilful disobedience. This shows what they must expect who hearken to the great deceiver. They that yield to him as a tempter, will be terrified by him as a tormentor. Those whom he now fawns upon, he will afterwards fly upon; and whom he draws into sin, he will try to drive to despair.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Under an oak - literally, "under the oak," or "the terebinth-tree."

The noun has the article in the original, and it refers perhaps to some well-known tree which was a landmark in the neighbourhood. The terebinth is a very longlived tree, and an aged one would be sure to become noted.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">the</span> oak; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the well-known oak. Possibly there was but one, or one of great size, in the neighbourhood - such trees are comparatively rare in Palestine. Possibly also this tree became well known from these events. It is singular that in another place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-8.htm">Genesis 35:8</a>) we read of "the oak" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>) of Bethel, whilst in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-5.htm">Judges 4:5</a> we read of the "palm tree" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>) of Deborah, between Ramah and <span class="accented">Bethel</span>." And it is not at all improbable, seeing that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-3.htm">1 Samuel 10:3</a> we read of the terebinth (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>) of <span class="accented">Tabor -</span> in the A.V. rendered "<span class="accented">plain</span> of Tabor" - which Ewald ("Hist. Israel," 3:21; 4:31) considers to be only a dialectic variation of <span class="accented">Deborah</span>, and remembering the great age to which these trees attain, that the same tree is referred to throughout. The word here used, it is true, is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (which is generally supposed to indicate the terebinth, but is also "used of any large tree" (Gesenius), and which, therefore, may be used of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> of Bethel. Both names are derived from the same root (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> <span class="accented">fortis</span>. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-9.htm">Amos 2:9</a>), and both indicate varieties - <span class="accented">what</span> varieties it is not quite clear - of the oak. Some expositors have seen in this brief rest the beginning of <span class="accented">his</span> sin, and certainly it would seem against the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of his instructions to remain so near a place (see note on ver. 16) from which he was to vanish speedily, and, if possible, unperceived.

"If thou gavest me," the man of God replied, "the half of thy house, I shall not go in with thee, nor eat bread and drink water in this place; for thus hath Jehovah commanded me," etc. The subject, Jehovah, is easily supplied to &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; from the context (vid., Ewald, 294, b.). God had forbidden the prophet to eat and drink "to manifest His detestation of idolatry, and to show by that fact that the Bethelites were so detestable, and as it were excommunicated by God, that He wished none of the faithful to join with them in eating and drinking" (C. a Lap.). He was not to return by the way by which he came, that no one might look out for him, and force him to a delay which was irreconcilable with his commission, or "lest by chance being brought back by Jeroboam, he should do anything to please him which was unworthy of a prophet, or from which it might be inferred that idolaters might hope for some favour from the Deity" (Budd.). </body></html>
