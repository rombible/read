Idolatrous worship will not continue, but the word of the Lord will endure for ever. The prediction plainly declared that the family of David would continue, and support true religion, when the ten tribes would not be able to resist them. If God, in justice, harden the hearts of sinners, so that the hand they have stretched out in sin they cannot pull in again by repentance, that is a spiritual judgment, represented by this, and much more dreadful. Jeroboam looked for help, not from his calves, but from God only, from his power, and his favour. The time may come when those that hate the preaching, would be glad of the prayers of faithful ministers. Jeroboam does not desire the prophet to pray that his sin might be pardoned, and his heart changed, but only that his hand might be restored. He seemed affected for the present with both the judgment and the mercy, but the impression wore off. God forbade his messenger to eat or drink in Bethel, to show his detestation of their idolatry and apostacy from God, and to teach us not to have fellowship with the works of darkness. Those have not learned self-denial, who cannot forbear one forbidden meal.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He gave a sign - A sign of this kind - an immediate prophecy to prove the divine character of a remote prophecy - had scarcely been given before this. In the later history, however, such signs are not unfrequent (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-29.htm">2 Kings 19:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14-16</a>).<p>The ashes ... shall be poured out - i. e., "The half-burnt remains of the offerings shall be ignominiously spilled upon the ground." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-9. he cried against the altar&#8212;which is put for the whole system of worship organized in Israel.<p>Behold, a child shall be born &#8230; Josiah by name&#8212;This is one of the most remarkable prophecies recorded in the Scriptures; and, in its clearness, circumstantial minuteness, and exact prediction of an event that took place three hundred sixty years later, it stands in striking contrast to the obscure and ambiguous oracles of the heathen. Being publicly uttered, it must have been well known to the people; and every Jew who lived at the accomplishment of the event must have been convinced of the truth of a religion connected with such a prophecy as this. A present sign was given of the remote event predicted, in a visible fissure being miraculously made on the altar. Incensed at the man's license of speech, Jeroboam stretched out his hand and ordered his attendants to seize the bold intruder. That moment the king's arm became stiff and motionless, and the altar split asunder, so that the fire and ashes fell on the floor. Overawed by the effects of his impiety, Jeroboam besought the prophet's prayer. His request was acceded to, and the hand was restored to its healthy state. Jeroboam was artful, and invited the prophet to the royal table, not to do him honor or show his gratitude for the restoration of his hand, but to win, by his courtesy and liberal hospitality, a person whom he could not crush by his power. But the prophet informed him of a divine injunction expressly prohibiting him from all social intercourse with any in the place, as well as from returning the same way. The prohibition not to eat or drink in Beth-el was because all the people had become apostates from the true religion, and the reason he was not allowed to return the same way was lest he should be recognized by any whom he had seen in going.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He put forth his hand, </span> to point out the man whom he would have the people lay hands on, and to stir them up to do so. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">From the altar; </span> where it was employed in offering something upon it. <span class="ital">Dried up</span>, or <span class="ital">withered</span>; the muscles and sinews, the instruments of motion, were shrunk up.

Hence it is said immediately ‘which he put forth against him.’ The R.V. has observed the order of the Hebrew in which the proper name Jeroboam comes in the second clause of the verse and not in the first: thus ‘when the king heard … Jeroboam put forth, &c.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">dried up</span>] The effect described is that of a limb becoming rigid, not so much shrivelling, as stiffening.

"Now stands the king of Israel, like some antique statue, in a posture of impotent endeavour" (Hall). This was a warning to the king, not so much against his unauthorized and schismatical rites, as against his attempt to avenge himself on the messenger of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-14.htm">Psalm 105:14, 15</a>).] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But this institution became a sin to Jeroboam, because it violated the fundamental law of the Old Testament religion, since this not only prohibited all worship of Jehovah under images and symbols (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>), but had not even left the choice of the place of worship to the people themselves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>.). "And the people went before the one to Dan." The expression "to Dan" can only be suitably explained by connecting it with &#1492;&#1506;&#1501;: the people even to Dan, i.e., the people throughout the whole kingdom even to Dan. The southern boundary as the terminus a quo is not mentioned; not because it was for a long time in dispute, but because it was already given in the allusion to Bethel. &#1492;&#1488;&#1495;&#1491; is neither the golden calf at Dan nor (as I formerly thought) that at Bethel, but is to be interpreted according to the receding &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1495;&#1491;: one of the two, or actually both the one and the other (Thenius). The sin of which Jeroboam was guilty consisted in the fact that he no longer allowed the people to go to the house of the Lord in Jerusalem, but induced or compelled them to worship Jehovah before one or the other of the calves which he had set up, or _(as it is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>) made a house of high places, &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-2.htm">1 Kings 3:2</a>), instead of the house of God, which the Lord had sanctified as the place of worship by filling it with His gracious presence. The singular &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1489; may be accounted for from the antithesis to &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, upon which it rests. There was no necessity to say expressly that there was a house of high places at Bethel and Dan, i.e., in two places, because it followed as a matter of course that the golden calves could not stand in the open air, but were placed in a temple, by which the sacrificial altar stood. These places of worship were houses of high places, Bamoth, because the ark of the covenant was wanting, and therewith the gracious presence of God, the Shechinah, for which no symbol invented by men could be a substitute. Moreover Jeroboam made "priests from the mass of the people, who were not of the sons of Levi." &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1502;&#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;, i.e., not of the poorest of the people (Luther and others), but from the last of the people onwards, that is to say, from the whole of the people any one without distinction even to the very last, instead of the priests chosen by God out of the tribe of Levi. For this meaning of &#1502;&#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-4.htm">Genesis 19:4</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-2.htm">Ezekiel 33:2</a>, also Lud. de Dieu on this passage. This innovation on the part of Jeroboam appears very surprising, if we consider how the Ephraimite Micah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-10.htm">Judges 17:10</a>.) rejoiced that he had obtained a Levite to act as priest for his image-worship, and can only be explained from the fact that the Levites did not consent to act as priests in the worship before the golden calves, but set their faces against it, and therefore, as is stated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-13.htm">2 Chronicles 11:13-14</a>, were obliged to leave their district towns and possessions and emigrate into the kingdom of Judah.</body></html>
