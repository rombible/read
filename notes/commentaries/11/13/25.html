God warns all whom he employs, strictly to observe their orders. We cannot judge of men by their sufferings, nor of sins by present punishments; with some, the flesh is destroyed, that the spirit may be saved; with others, the flesh is pampered, that the soul may ripen for hell. Jeroboam returned not from his evil way. He promised himself that the calves would secure the crown to his family, but they lost it, and sunk his family. Those betray themselves who think to support themselves by any sin whatever. Let us dread prospering in sinful ways; pray to be kept from every delusion and temptation, and to be enabled to walk with self-denying perseverance in the way of God's commands.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the anxiety of the Hebrews to be buried with their fathers, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-30.htm">Genesis 47:30</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-29.htm">Genesis 49:29</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-1.htm">Genesis 49:1</a>,<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-25.htm">Genesis 49:25</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-37.htm">2 Samuel 19:37</a>, etc. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. a lion met him by the way, and slew him&#8212;There was a wood near Beth-el infested with lions (2Ki 2:24). This sad catastrophe was a severe but necessary judgment of God, to attest the truth of the message with which the prophet had been charged. All the circumstances of this tragic occurrence (the undevoured carcass, the untouched ass, the passengers unmolested by the lion, though standing there) were calculated to produce an irresistible impression that the hand of God was in it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And, behold, men passed by,....

By this means, the very disobedience and death of the man of God became a part of the protest against the new rites.

The man of God had resisted the invitations of Jeroboam, and set out by a different road to return to Judah.
