It has been indeed suggested that the words. “Josiah by name” are a marginal gloss which has crept into the text, or the insertion of the chronicler writing after the event, and not a part of the original prophetic utterance. The latter supposition is in itself not unlikely. But the mention of the name in prediction is exemplified in the well-known reference to Cyrus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm" title="That said of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, You shall be built; and to the temple, Your foundation shall be laid.">Isaiah 44:28</a>; and in this instance, as perhaps also in that, the name is significant (for Josiah means “one healed” or “helped by Jehovah”), and is not, therefore, a mere artificial detail. The particularity of prediction, which is on all hands recognised as exceptional, will be credible or incredible to us, according to the view which we take of the nature of prophetic prediction. If we resolve it into the intuitive sagacity of an inspired mind forecasting the future, because it sees more clearly than ordinary minds the germs of that future in the present, the particularity must seem incredible. If, on the other hand, we believe it to be the supernatural gift of a power to enter, in some measure, into “the mind of God,” in whose fore- knowledge all the future is already seen and ordained, then it will be to us simply unusual, but in no sense incredible, that from time to time foreknowledge of details, as well as generalities, should be granted. It is beyond controversy that the latter view is the one put forward in Holy Scripture, both in the Old Testament and in the New. Prophecy is, indeed, something higher and greater than supernatural prediction; but it claims to include such prediction, both as a test of mission from God, and as a necessary part of its revelation of the dispensations of God. On the fulfilment of this prediction, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/23-15.htm" title="Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.">2Kings 23:15-20</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-2.htm" title="And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus said the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and on you shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense on you, and men's bones shall be burnt on you.">1 Kings 13:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">He cried against the altar — </span>And consequently against all the worship performed at it. <span class="ital">O altar, altar — </span>He directs his speech against the altar, because the following signs were to be wrought upon it. <span class="ital">Behold, a child shall be born, </span>&c. — This prophecy is the more wonderful, because it foretels of what family the child should spring, and what should be his name; and in the accomplishment of it we see the absolute certainty of God’s providence and foreknowledge, even in the most contingent things. For the particulars here mentioned, namely, the having a child, and the giving it this name, were in themselves things as uncertain, dependent on man’s will, and contingent as any events can be: and yet God exactly foretold them, and they came to pass accordingly. God therefore can foresee how the will of man, and of numbers of men, whose wills are dependant on each other, will be influenced in all possible circumstances, and that for ages to come; or, he can certainly and effectually, and yet without infringing or violating man’s liberty, overrule his will which way he pleaseth; otherwise it was possible this prediction might have been false, which it would be blasphemy to assert. <span class="ital">Upon it shall he offer the priests — </span>The meaning is not that he should offer or burn the priests alive, but that he should slay the priests of the high places, and then burn their bones, as he did the bones of those that had been buried, and thereby should defile this altar. How bold was the man that durst thus attack the king in his pride, and interrupt the solemnity in which he gloried! Those who are sent on God’s errand, must not fear the faces of men. Although it was so many ages ere this prophecy was to be fulfilled, the time is spoken of as sure and nigh at hand. For a thousand years are with God as one day.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:1-10 In threatening the altar, the prophet threatens the founder and worshippers. Idolatrous worship will not continue, but the word of the Lord will endure for ever. The prediction plainly declared that the family of David would continue, and support true religion, when the ten tribes would not be able to resist them. If God, in justice, harden the hearts of sinners, so that the hand they have stretched out in sin they cannot pull in again by repentance, that is a spiritual judgment, represented by this, and much more dreadful. Jeroboam looked for help, not from his calves, but from God only, from his power, and his favour. The time may come when those that hate the preaching, would be glad of the prayers of faithful ministers. Jeroboam does not desire the prophet to pray that his sin might be pardoned, and his heart changed, but only that his hand might be restored. He seemed affected for the present with both the judgment and the mercy, but the impression wore off. God forbade his messenger to eat or drink in Bethel, to show his detestation of their idolatry and apostacy from God, and to teach us not to have fellowship with the works of darkness. Those have not learned self-denial, who cannot forbear one forbidden meal.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A child shall be born ... Josiah by name - Divine predictions so seldom descend to such particularity as this, that doubts are entertained, even by orthodox theologians, with respect to the actual mention of Josiah's name by a prophet living in the time of Jeroboam. Only one other instance that can be considered parallel occurs in the whole of Scripture - the mention of Cyrus by Isaiah. Of course no one who believes in the divine foreknowledge can doubt that God could, if He chose, cause events to be foretold minutely by his prophets; but certainly the general law of his Providence is, that He does not do so. If this law is to be at any time broken through, it will not be capriciously. Here it certainly does not appear what great effect was to be produced by the mention of Josiah's name so long before his birth; and hence, a doubt arises whether we have in our present copies the true original text. The sense is complete without the words "Josiah by name;" and these words, if originally a marginal note, may easily have crept into the text by the mistake of a copyist. It is remarkable that, where this narrative is again referred to in Kings (marginal reference), there is no allusion to the fact that the man of God had prophesied of Josiah "by name." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-9. he cried against the altar&#8212;which is put for the whole system of worship organized in Israel.<p>Behold, a child shall be born &#8230; Josiah by name&#8212;This is one of the most remarkable prophecies recorded in the Scriptures; and, in its clearness, circumstantial minuteness, and exact prediction of an event that took place three hundred sixty years later, it stands in striking contrast to the obscure and ambiguous oracles of the heathen. Being publicly uttered, it must have been well known to the people; and every Jew who lived at the accomplishment of the event must have been convinced of the truth of a religion connected with such a prophecy as this. A present sign was given of the remote event predicted, in a visible fissure being miraculously made on the altar. Incensed at the man's license of speech, Jeroboam stretched out his hand and ordered his attendants to seize the bold intruder. That moment the king's arm became stiff and motionless, and the altar split asunder, so that the fire and ashes fell on the floor. Overawed by the effects of his impiety, Jeroboam besought the prophet's prayer. His request was acceded to, and the hand was restored to its healthy state. Jeroboam was artful, and invited the prophet to the royal table, not to do him honor or show his gratitude for the restoration of his hand, but to win, by his courtesy and liberal hospitality, a person whom he could not crush by his power. But the prophet informed him of a divine injunction expressly prohibiting him from all social intercourse with any in the place, as well as from returning the same way. The prohibition not to eat or drink in Beth-el was because all the people had become apostates from the true religion, and the reason he was not allowed to return the same way was lest he should be recognized by any whom he had seen in going.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He cried against the altar; </span> and consequently, against all that worship, which is oft signified by the name of the <span class="ital">altar</span>.

Render therefore (with R.V.) ‘by the word.’ The meaning is that both the journey from Judah and the prophecy were in consequence of divine instruction.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Josiah by name</span>] The history of the fulfilment of this prophecy is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/23-15.htm" title="Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove....">2 Kings 23:15-16</a>. Between the accession of Jeroboam and the accession of Josiah was an interval of about 330 years. Hence as the name of the king who should execute the threatened vengeance is mentioned, this prophecy is remarkable among the predictions of the Old Testament. There is nothing with which it can be compared except the prophecy concerning Cyrus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm" title="That said of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, You shall be built; and to the temple, Your foundation shall be laid.">Isaiah 44:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have held, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut;">Isaiah 45:1</a>, nor is it according to the manner of scriptural prophecies to be precise about details such as this. Hence some have thought that this verse and also other parts of the story of this chapter were brought into their present form at a later date than Jeroboam. The story of the appearance of the prophet and of his prediction were known from the first, but the details here given were inserted when the prediction was accomplished. There is certainly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-32.htm" title="For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.">1 Kings 13:32</a> a notice of the ‘cities of Samaria’ which confirms this opinion. Jeroboam’s capital was Shechem, and Samaria was not built, nor any district so called, till the reign of Omri the father of Ahab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-24.htm" title="And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.">1 Kings 16:24</a>). Again, it is unlike the rest of the narrative of the Books of Kings that no name should be given to either of the prophets who play such a part in the story. It seems therefore probable that the chapter is taken from some other source than that which supplied what has gone before and what follows it. If this be so, we need not be surprised at what was noticed on the previous verse, that Jeroboam’s action in approaching the altar seems noted as impious while Solomon’s sacrifices are accepted. The compiler of the Books of Kings gathered his material from various sources, and did his work after Josiah was dead. There is no difficulty in understanding how by that time the story as he has given it had been put on record, and as he wished to place Jeroboam’s sin in a strong light all through his history, the events here recorded were exceedingly appropriate for incorporation in his narrative.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">upon thee shall he offer the priests</span>] The verb is that which is usually rendered <span class="bld">sacrifice</span>, and it is better (with R.V.) so to translate it. Josephus states specifically ‘upon thee shall he sacrifice the false priests which shall be at that time’. Not only was the king to defile the altar by casting upon it the bones of the dead, but his righteous vengeance was to fall also upon the idolatrous priests then living, and they were to be slain by him before the altars at which they ministered.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">men’s bones shall be burnt</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">shall they burn</span>. There is no gain apparent in departing from the literal rendering of the original.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he cried against the altar in the word of the Lord, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the Lord</span> [This apostrophe of the altar is very striking and significant. It is as if the prophet disdained to notice the royal but self-constituted priest; as if it were useless to appeal to him; as if his person was of little consequence compared with the religious system he was inaugurating, the system of which the altar was the centre and embodiment]; <span class="cmt_word">Behold a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name</span> [This particular mention of the Reformer by name was formerly regarded, as by many it is still, as a remarkable instance of prophetic foresight. But the tendency of late, even amongst orthodox theologians, has been to doubt the authenticity of these two words, on the ground that it is unlike Scripture prophecy in general to descend to such details, which rather belong to soothsaying than prediction. Prophecy concerns itself not with names, times, and similar particulars, but with the "progressive development of the kingdom of God in its general features" (Keil). It is not for a moment denied that the prophet could just as easily, speaking "in the word of the Lord," have mentioned the name of Josiah, as the circumstance that a son of the house of David would utterly destroy the worship of calves. But it is alleged that the latter prediction is quite in accordance with Scripture usage, and the former altogether contrarient thereto. The case of Cyrus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>), it is true, is an exception to the rule, unless <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (which means <span class="accented">the sun</span>) is, like Pharaoh and Hadad, a name of office, a title of the Persian kings. The instances of Isaac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>) and Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9</a>) are not parallels, as in both these cases the name was highly significant, and each was mentioned, not by way of prophecy, but as a direction to bestow that name on a child shortly about to be born. And it is certainly noticeable - though the argument <span class="accented">e</span> <span class="accented">silentio is</span> necessarily a precarious one - "that where this narrative is again referred to (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-15.htm">2 Kings 23:15-18</a>) there is no allusion to the fact that the man of God had prophesied of Josiah <span class="accented">by</span> <span class="accented">name"</span> (Rawlinson). On the whole, therefore, it seems probable that the two words <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;</span> were no part of the original prophecy, but a marginal note which in course of time found its way accidentally into the text. The idea of Keil, that "Josiah" is mentioned here not as a proper name, but as an appellation, "he whom Jehovah sustains," is hardly worthy of serious consideration. It may be allowed, however, that the <span class="accented">meaning</span> of the name affords some slender reason for its mention]; <span class="cmt_word">and upon thee shall he offer</span> [lit., <span class="accented">sacrifice</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the priests of the high places</span> [see on 1 Kings 12:32] <span class="cmt_word">that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">bones of man, i.e.</span>, human bones. Nothing could more completely foreshadow the future desecration of the altar. The presence in the congregation of a living man who had merely touched a dead body and had not been purified, defiled the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-13.htm">Numbers 19:13</a>), how much more the dead body itself, burnt on the very altar. The Samaritan who once strewed the temple with human ashes (Jos., Ant. 18:02.2) knew that he took the most effectual way to pollute it] <span class="cmt_word">shall be burnt</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">shall they burn</span>] <span class="cmt_word">upon thee.</span> [For the fulfilment, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-20.htm">2 Kings 23:20</a>, "At the ground of this judgment, as of the whole theocratic law, lies the <span class="accented">jus</span> talionis" (Keil, 1846).] It is worthy of note how completely this brief protest proclaimed to Jeroboam the utter and shameful overthrow, both of his political and religious systems. A child of the rival house of David should stand where <span class="accented">he</span> then stood, his successors extinct or powerless to prevent him, and should cover this new cultus with disgrace and contempt. The man of God, he must have felt, has proclaimed in few words the fall of his dynasty, the triumph of his rival, and the failure of all his schemes. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He therefore consulted, sc., with his counsellors, or the heads of the nation, who had helped him to the throne, and made two calves of gold. &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; &#1506;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497; are young oxen, not of pure gold however, or cast in brass and gilded, but in all probability like the golden calf which Aaron had cast for the people at Sinai, made of a kernel of wood, which was then covered with gold plate (see the Comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>). That Jeroboam had in his mind not merely the Egyptian Apis-worship generally, but more especially the image-worship which Aaron introduced for the people at Sinai, is evident from the words borrowed from <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>, with which he studiously endeavoured to recommend his new form of worship to the people: "Behold, this is thy God, O Israel, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt." &#1512;&#1489;&#1470;&#1500;&#1499;&#1501; &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, it is too much for you to go to Jerusalem; not "let your going suffice," because &#1502;&#1503; is not to be taken in a partitive sense here, as it is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-28.htm">Exodus 9:28</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-6.htm">Ezekiel 44:6</a>. What Jeroboam meant to say by the words, "Behold thy God," etc., was, "this is no new religion, but this was the form of worship which our fathers used in the desert, with Aaron himself leading the way" (Seb. Schmidt). And whilst the verbal allusion to that event at Sinai plainly shows that this worship was not actual idolatry, i.e., was not a worship of Egyptian idols, from which it is constantly distinguished in our books as well as in Hosea and Amos, but that Jehovah was worshipped under the image of the calves or young oxen; the choice of the places in which the golden calves were set up also shows that Jeroboam desired to adhere as closely as possible to ancient traditions. He did not select his own place of residence, but Bethel and Dan. Bethel, on the southern border of his kingdom, which properly belonged to the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-13.htm">Joshua 18:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-22.htm">Joshua 18:22</a>), the present Beitin, had already been consecrated as a divine seat by the vision of Jehovah which the patriarch Jacob received there in a dream (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-11.htm">Genesis 28:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>), and Jacob gave it the name of Bethel, house of God, and afterwards built an altar there to the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-7.htm">Genesis 35:7</a>). And Jeroboam may easily have fancied, and have tried to persuade others, that Jehovah would reveal Himself to the descendants of Jacob in this sacred place just as well as He had done to their forefather. - Dan, in the northern part of the kingdom, on the one source of the Jordan, formerly called Laish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-26.htm">Judges 18:26</a>.), was also consecrated as a place of worship by the image-worship established there by the Danites, at which even a grandson of Moses had officiated; and regard may also have been had to the convenience of the people, namely, that the tribes living in the north would not have to go a long distance to perform their worship.</body></html>
