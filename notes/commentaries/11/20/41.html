Have we not found him so? That is gospel repentance, which flows from an apprehension of the mercy of God, in Christ; there is forgiveness with him. What a change is here! The most haughty in prosperity often are most abject in adversity; an evil spirit will thus affect a man in both these conditions. There are those on whom, like Ahab, success is ill bestowed; they know not how to serve either God or their generation, or even their own true interests with their prosperity: Let favour be showed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness. The prophet designed to reprove Ahab by a parable. If a good prophet were punished for sparing his friend and God's when God said, Smite, of much sorer punishment should a wicked king be thought worthy, who spared his enemy and God's, when God said, Smite. Ahab went to his house, heavy and displeased, not truly penitent, or seeking to undo what he had done amiss; every way out of humour, notwithstanding his victory. Alas! many that hear the glad tidings of Christ, are busy and there till the day of salvation is gone.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He was of the prophets - Josephus and others conjecture that this prophet was Micaiah, the son of Imlah (but compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-13.htm">1 Kings 20:13</a> note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>39. a talent of silver&#8212;&pound;342.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Perhaps the hairy prophetic mantle was the usual garb, and that on the present occasion the prophet had some wrapping thrown over that, which he laid aside along with the head band, and then the king recognised his character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">out of</span> thy <span class="ital">hand</span>] The LXX. represents the pronoun, which is omitted in the Hebrew text, perhaps only by a slip of the scribe.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">removed the covering from upon his eyes</span>]; <span class="cmt_word">and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.</span> [That is, he was one of the  prophets who were known to him The face alone would hardly have proclaimed him a prophet.

A disciple of the prophets received instructions from God, to announce to the king that God would punish him for letting Benhadad go, and to do this, as Nathan had formerly done in the case of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1</a>.), by means of a symbolical action, whereby the king was led to pronounce sentence upon himself. The disciples of the prophets said to his companion, "in the word of Jehovah," i.e., by virtue of a revelation from God (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>), "Smite me;" and when the friend refused to smite him, he announced to him that because of this disobedience to the voice of the Lord, after his departure from him a lion would meet him and smite him, i.e., would kill him; a threat which was immediately fulfilled. This occurrence shows with how severe a punishment all opposition to the commandments of God to the prophets was followed, as a warning for others; just as in the similar occurrence in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-24.htm">1 Kings 13:24</a>. </body></html>
