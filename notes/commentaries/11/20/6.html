It is notable that in the last extremity Ahab falls back on an exceptional appeal to the patriotism of the people.<p>The “elders of the land” (evidently present in Samaria at this time) were the representatives in the northern kingdom of the ancient assembly of the “elders of Israel,” existing from the time of Moses downwards as a senate, having power not only of advice, but of concurrence, in relation to the Judge or King. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-16.htm" title="Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:">Exodus 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-21.htm" title="Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.">Exodus 12:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-1.htm" title="And he said to Moses, Come up to the LORD, you, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship you afar off.">Exodus 24:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-1.htm" title="And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this day.">Deuteronomy 27:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-9.htm" title="And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, which bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel.">Deuteronomy 31:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-6.htm" title="And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust on their heads.">Joshua 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-3.htm" title="So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.">2Samuel 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-3.htm" title="And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.">1Kings 8:3</a>). The solemn appointment of the seventy in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/11-24.htm" title="And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle.">Numbers 11:24-25</a> seems to be simply the re-constitution and consecration of the original body. Each tribe and each town had also its lesser body of elders. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-26.htm" title="And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;">1Samuel 30:26</a>, “the elders of Judah;” <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-12.htm" title="Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him there, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.">Deuteronomy 19:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-3.htm" title="And it shall be, that the city which is next to the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which has not been worked with, and which has not drawn in the yoke;">Deuteronomy 21:3</a>, &c., “the elders of the city.”) The authority of all these assemblies must have been at all times largely overborne by the royal power (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-11.htm" title="And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them.">1Kings 21:11</a>), and must have varied according to time and circumstance.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:1-11 Benhadad sent Ahab a very insolent demand. Ahab sent a very disgraceful submission; sin brings men into such straits, by putting them out of the Divine protection. If God do not rule us, our enemies shall: guilt dispirits men, and makes them cowards. Ahab became desperate. Men will part with their most pleasant things, those they most love, to save their lives; yet they lose their souls rather than part with any pleasure or interest to prevent it. Here is one of the wisest sayings that ever Ahab spake, and it is a good lesson to all. It is folly to boast of any day to come, since we know not what it may bring forth. Apply it to our spiritual conflicts. Peter fell by self-confidence. Happy is the man who is never off his watch.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ben-hadad, disappointed by Ahab's consent to an indignity which he had thought no monarch could submit to, proceeds to put a fresh construction on his former demands. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-12. Thus said Ben-hadad, Thy silver and thy gold is mine&#8212;To this message sent him during the siege, Ahab returned a tame and submissive answer, probably thinking it meant no more than an exaction of tribute. But the demand was repeated with greater insolence; and yet, from the abject character of Ahab, there is reason to believe he would have yielded to this arrogant claim also, had not the voice of his subjects been raised against it. Ben-hadad's object in these and other boastful menaces was to intimidate Ahab. But the weak sovereign began to show a little more spirit, as appears in his abandoning "my lord the king" for the single "tell him," and giving him a dry but sarcastic hint to glory no more till the victory is won. Kindling into a rage at the cool defiance, Ben-hadad gave orders for the immediate sack of the city.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Yet now I will not accept of those terms, but, together with thy royal treasures, I expect all the treasures of thy servants or subjects; nor will I wait till thou deliver them to me, but I will send my servants into the city, and they shall have free liberty and power to search out and take away all which they desire, and this to prevent fraud and delay; and then I will grant thee a peace. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Yet I will send my servants unto thee tomorrow about this time,....

But the Hebrew text is to be preferred. The object of Ben-hadad was to couch his message in the most oftensive and humiliating terms, and "the desire of <span class="accented">thine</span> eyes" would be likely to cut deeper and wound more than "the desire of <span class="accented">their</span> eyes"], <span class="cmt_word">they shall put it in their hand, and take it away</span>. [If Ahab ever hoped by his abject submission to conciliate the Syrian king, he now finds that his words have had just the opposite effect. For all that the latter concluded from it was that Ahab was one upon whom he might trample at pleasure, and this servility encouraged Ben-hadad to renew his demands in a still more galling and vexatious form. This second message discloses to us still more plainly the royal bully and braggart, and shows us what the "comity of nations" in the old world was often like.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then Elisha returned, took the pair of oxen with which he had been ploughing, sacrificed, i.e., slaughtered them (&#1494;&#1489;&#1495; used figuratively), boiled the flesh with the plough, gave a farewell meal to the people (of his place of abode), i.e., his friends and acquaintance, and then followed Elijah as his servant, i.e., his assistant.
