If the reading be sound, we must suppose, first, that Ben-hadad's attack was very sudden, and that Ahab had no time to collect forces from distant parts of the country; and secondly, that during the long siege the garrison of Samaria had been greatly reduced, until it now did not exceed 7,000 men fit for service. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ki 20:13-20. The Syrians Are Slain.<p>13-21. behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab&#8212;Though the king and people of Israel had highly offended Him, God had not utterly cast them off. He still cherished designs of mercy towards them, and here, though unasked, gave them a signal proof of His interest in them, by a prophet's animating announcement that the Lord would that day deliver the mighty hosts of the enemy into his hand by means of a small, feeble, inadequate band. Conformably to the prophet's instructions, two hundred thirty-two young men went boldly out towards the camp of the enemy, while seven thousand more, apparently volunteers, followed at some little distance, or posted themselves at the gate, to be ready to reinforce those in front if occasion required it. Ben-hadad and his vassals and princes were already, at that early hour&#8212;scarcely midday&#8212;deep in their cups; and though informed of this advancing company, yet confiding in his numbers, or it may be, excited with wine, he ordered with indifference the proud intruders to be taken alive, whether they came with peaceful or hostile intentions. It was more easily said than done; the young men smote right and left, making terrible havoc among their intended captors; and their attack, together with the sight of the seven thousand, who soon rushed forward to mingle in the fray, created a panic in the Syrian army, who immediately took up flight. Ben-hadad himself escaped the pursuit of the victors on a fleet horse, surrounded by a squadron of horse guards. This glorious victory, won so easily, and with such a paltry force opposed to overwhelming numbers, was granted that Ahab and his people might know (1Ki 20:13) that God is the Lord. But we do not read of this acknowledgment being made, or of any sacrifices being offered in token of their national gratitude.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All the children of Israel; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

A very small number to go forth against so great an army as the host of the Syrians, and these raw unexperienced young men: <p>and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand; which could never be the number of all the people in the land, nor even in the city of Samaria, who were able to bear arms; but it must mean such who were willing to go out to war on this occasion: and the number being just the same as of those that bowed not the knee to Baal, has led the Jewish commentators to conclude that these were the men that were numbered for war; but it is not likely that they were all in Samaria, or that none but those would go to war, though it must be owned the number is remarkable. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_kings/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">Then he numbered</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">mustered</span>] <span class="ital">the young men</span>] The verb occurs several times in this chapter, and is always rendered ‘numbered’ (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/20-26.htm" title="And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel....">1 Kings 20:26-27</a> and the two instances in this verse), as indeed it is in nearly all cases in A.V. But looking at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-27.htm" title="And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.">1 Kings 20:27</a>, in comparison with this verse, ‘to number’ can hardly be correct, for then the operation would have been performed twice over, manifestly a needless proceeding. The verb literally signifies ‘to visit’, hence ‘to hold a visitation, or gathering,’ and so ‘to muster’ appears to represent the sense here very well. See also the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-25.htm" title="And number you an army, like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he listened to their voice, and did so.">1 Kings 20:25</a> below.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>even <span class="ital">all the children of Israel</span>] The LXX. omits these words. The smallness of the number mentioned (7000) is very remarkable. Josephus only speaks of them as the rest of the army. There were no doubt many more men of war in Israel, but if the number in the text be correct, it must be that Ahab had not been able to bring many soldiers together in the city by reason of the suddenness of the attack, or because so many other persons from the country had crowded into the safest places, and thus there was no room for more.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span> <span class="cmt_word">he numbered</span> [or <span class="accented">reviewed</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-44.htm">Numbers 1:44</a> sqq.; Numbers 3:39-43)] <span class="cmt_word">the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two</span> [cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-11.htm">2 Chronicles 14:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a>, etc. LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>. Theodoret remarks that by this band - 230, as he understood it - Almighty God would destroy the hosts of thirty and two kings. The numbers may have been recorded because of the correspondency]: <span class="cmt_word">and after them he numbered all the people, even all</span> <span class="cmt_word">the children of Israel, being seven thousand</span>. [This number is of course to be understood, unlike that of ch. 19:18, literally. And the context (cf. ver. 19) shows that this was the number of fighting men. But this small army can hardly fail to create surprise, especially if we compare it with the statistics of the soldiery of an earlier age (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-9.htm">2 Samuel 24:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-5.htm">1 Chronicles 21:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-3.htm">2 Chronicles 13:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-8.htm">2 Chronicles 14:8</a>). It is true this was not strictly an army, but a garrison for the defence of the capital. But it looks very much as if, under the feeble rule of Ahab, the kingdom of Israel had become thoroughly disorganized. "The position of Jarchi is that of a true Rabbi, viz., that the 7000 were those who had not bowed the knee unto Baal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>)," Bahr.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The elders and all the people, i.e., the citizens of Samaria. advised that his demand should not be granted. &#1514;&#1488;&#1502;&#1492; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, "hearken not (to him), and thou wilt not be willing" (&#1493;&#1500;&#1488; is stronger than &#1488;&#1500;; yet compare Ewald, 350, a.); whereupon Ahab sent the messengers away with this answer, that he would submit to the first demand, but that the second he could not grant.</body></html>
