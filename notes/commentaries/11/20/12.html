The orders of the proud, drunken king disordered his troops, and prevented them from attacking the Israelites. Those that are most secure, are commonly least courageous. Ahab slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.

The term seems to be properly applied to a stationary "booth" or "hut," as distinguished from a moveable "tent." On military expeditions, and especially in the case of a siege, such "huts" were naturally constructed to shelter the king and his chief officers. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions&#8212;booths made of branches of trees and brushwood; which were reared for kings in the camp, as they still are for Turkish pashas or agas in their expeditions [Keil].<p>Set yourselves in array&#8212;Invest the city.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Set yourselves in array; </span> put yourselves and engines in order to make the assault. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass, when Benhadad heard this message (as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions),....

Benhadad was made still more audacious by this submissiveness, and sent messengers the second time with the following notice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-6.htm">1 Kings 20:6</a>): "Yea, if I send my servants to thee to-morrow at this time, and they search thy house and thy servants' houses, all that is the pleasure of thine eyes they will put into their hands and take." &#1488;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; does not mean "only  equals  certainly" here (Ewald, 356, b.), for there is neither a negative clause nor an oath, but &#1488;&#1501; signifies if and &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; introduces the statement, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-5.htm">1 Kings 20:5</a>; so that it is only in the repetition of the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; that the emphasis lies, which can be expressed by yea. The words of Ahab in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-9.htm">1 Kings 20:9</a> show unquestionably that Benhadad demanded more the second time than the first. The words of the first demand, "Thy silver and thy gold," etc., were ambiguous. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-5.htm">1 Kings 20:5</a>, Benhadad meant that Ahab should give him all this; and Ahab had probably understood him as meaning that he was to give him what he required, in order to purchase peace; but Benhadad had, no doubt, from the very first required an unconditional surrender at discretion. He expresses this very clearly in the second demand, since he announces to Ahab the plunder of his palace and also of the palaces of his nobles. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1491; &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, all thy costly treasures. It was from this second demand that Ahab first perceived what Benhadad's intention had been; he therefore laid the matter before the elders of the land, i.e., the king's counsellors, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-7.htm">1 Kings 20:7</a> : "Mark and see that this man seeketh evil," i.e., that he is aiming at our ruin, since he is not contented with the first demand, which I did not refuse him.</body></html>
