We see from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-35.htm" title="And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray you.

The vindication of the majesty of God before the Syrians, as well as before Israel—like the more celebrated case of the rebuke of the blasphemy of Sennacherib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/19-16.htm" title="LORD, bow down your ear, and hear: open, LORD, your eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which has sent him to reproach the living God.">2Kings 19:16-34</a>)—is in accordance with the prayer of Solomon, or the similar utterances in the Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/67-2.htm" title="That your way may be known on earth, your saving health among all nations.">Psalm 67:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-15.htm" title="So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth your glory.">Psalm 102:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/138-4.htm" title="All the kings of the earth shall praise you, O LORD, when they hear the words of your mouth.">Psalm 138:4</a>), “That all the people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee;” and also with such prophetic declarations as those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-9.htm" title="But I worked for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.">Ezekiel 20:9</a>, “I wrought for my Name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen.” It is a foreshadowing of that view of all nations, as in some degree having knowledge of God and probation before Him, which is afterwards worked out fully in the prophetic writings. The intense and powerful Monotheism of the religion of Israel, in spite of all its backslidings, could hardly have been without influence over the neighbouring nations (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-15.htm" title="And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray you, take a blessing of your servant.">2Kings 5:15</a>), especially at a time when the remembrance of Solomon’s vast empire, and still wider influence, would yet linger through the tenacious traditions of the East.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-28.htm" title="And there came a man of God, and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, Thus said the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the LORD.">1 Kings 20:28</a></span>. <span class="ital">Because the Syrians have said, </span>&c. — What they had said, this man of God knew, either from common report, strengthened by their present choice of plain ground for the battle; or rather, by revelation from God, to whose inspection their secret counsels lay open, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-12.htm" title="And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedchamber.">2 Kings 6:12</a>.

They take it for granted that it was not Israel, but Israel's gods, that beat them; but they speak very ignorantly of Jehovah. They supposed that Israel had many gods, to whom they ascribed limited power within a certain district; thus vain were the Gentiles in their imaginations concerning God. The greatest wisdom in worldly concerns is often united with the most contemptible folly in the things of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A man of God - Evidently not the prophet who had spoken to Ahab the year before <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-13.htm">1 Kings 20:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-22.htm">1 Kings 20:22</a>.

Humanly speaking, that little handful of men would have been overpowered by numbers. But a prophet was sent to the small Israelite army to announce the victory, in order to convince the Syrians that the God of Israel was omnipotent everywhere, in the valley as well as on the hills. And, accordingly, after the two armies had pitched opposite each other for seven days, they came to an open battle. One hundred thousand Syrians lay dead on the field, while the fugitives took refuge in Aphek, and there, crowding on the city walls, they endeavored to make a stand against their pursuers; but the old walls giving way under the incumbent weight, fell and buried twenty-seven thousand in the ruins. Ben-hadad succeeded in extricating himself, and, with his attendants, sought concealment in the city, fleeing from chamber to chamber; or, as some think it, an inner chamber, that is, a harem; but seeing no ultimate means of escape, he was advised to throw himself on the tender mercies of the Israelitish monarch.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Because the Syrians have said; </span> which he knew, either by common report, strengthened by their present choice of a plain ground for the battle; or rather, by revelation from God, who discovered their secret counsels, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-12.htm" title="And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedchamber.">2 Kings 6:12</a></span>.
