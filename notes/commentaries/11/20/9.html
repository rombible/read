Ahab sent a very disgraceful submission; sin brings men into such straits, by putting them out of the Divine protection. If God do not rule us, our enemies shall: guilt dispirits men, and makes them cowards. Ahab became desperate. Men will part with their most pleasant things, those they most love, to save their lives; yet they lose their souls rather than part with any pleasure or interest to prevent it. Here is one of the wisest sayings that ever Ahab spake, and it is a good lesson to all. It is folly to boast of any day to come, since we know not what it may bring forth. Apply it to our spiritual conflicts. Peter fell by self-confidence.

Thus said Ben-hadad, Thy silver and thy gold is mine&#8212;To this message sent him during the siege, Ahab returned a tame and submissive answer, probably thinking it meant no more than an exaction of tribute. But the demand was repeated with greater insolence; and yet, from the abject character of Ahab, there is reason to believe he would have yielded to this arrogant claim also, had not the voice of his subjects been raised against it. Ben-hadad's object in these and other boastful menaces was to intimidate Ahab. But the weak sovereign began to show a little more spirit, as appears in his abandoning "my lord the king" for the single "tell him," and giving him a dry but sarcastic hint to glory no more till the victory is won. Kindling into a rage at the cool defiance, Ben-hadad gave orders for the immediate sack of the city.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">This thing I may not do; </span> if I would do it, I cannot, because my people will not suffer it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Wherefore he sent unto the messengers of Benhadad,....

The Hebrew accords better with the generally submissive conduct of Ahab throughout the whole narrative. The picture of the power of the Israelitish king is not very magnificent.

But we must remember that a man is ready to <span class="accented">promise</span> almost anything in his extremity, and that we do not know what construction he put, or would have claimed to put, upon Ben-hadad's first demand, had that monarch consented to revert to these conditions, or by what means he hoped to evade it]. <span class="cmt_word">And the messengers departed, and brought him</span> [Ben-hadad, not Ahab, as Rawlinson  imagines] <span class="cmt_word">word again</span>.

Benhadad was made still more audacious by this submissiveness, and sent messengers the second time with the following notice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-6.htm">1 Kings 20:6</a>): "Yea, if I send my servants to thee to-morrow at this time, and they search thy house and thy servants' houses, all that is the pleasure of thine eyes they will put into their hands and take." &#1488;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; does not mean "only  equals  certainly" here (Ewald, 356, b.), for there is neither a negative clause nor an oath, but &#1488;&#1501; signifies if and &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; introduces the statement, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-5.htm">1 Kings 20:5</a>; so that it is only in the repetition of the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; that the emphasis lies, which can be expressed by yea. The words of Ahab in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-9.htm">1 Kings 20:9</a> show unquestionably that Benhadad demanded more the second time than the first. The words of the first demand, "Thy silver and thy gold," etc., were ambiguous. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-5.htm">1 Kings 20:5</a>, Benhadad meant that Ahab should give him all this; and Ahab had probably understood him as meaning that he was to give him what he required, in order to purchase peace; but Benhadad had, no doubt, from the very first required an unconditional surrender at discretion. He expresses this very clearly in the second demand, since he announces to Ahab the plunder of his palace and also of the palaces of his nobles. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1491; &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, all thy costly treasures. It was from this second demand that Ahab first perceived what Benhadad's intention had been; he therefore laid the matter before the elders of the land, i.e., the king's counsellors, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-7.htm">1 Kings 20:7</a> : "Mark and see that this man seeketh evil," i.e., that he is aiming at our ruin, since he is not contented with the first demand, which I did not refuse him.</body></html>
