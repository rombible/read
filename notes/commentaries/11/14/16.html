Ahijah foretells the speedy death of the child then sick, in mercy to him. He only in the house of Jeroboam had affection for the true worship of God, and disliked the worship of the calves. To show the power and sovereignty of his grace, God saves some out of the worst families, in whom there is some good thing towards the Lord God of Israel. The righteous are removed from the evil to come in this world, to the good to come in a better world. It is often a bad sign for a family, when the best in it are buried out of it. Yet their death never can be a loss to themselves. It was a present affliction to the family and kingdom, by which both ought to have been instructed. God also tells the judgments which should come upon the people of Israel, for conforming to the worship Jeroboam established. After they left the house of David, the government never continued long in one family, but one undermined and destroyed another. Families and kingdoms are ruined by sin. If great men do wickedly, they draw many others, both into the guilt and punishment. The condemnation of those will be severest, who must answer, not only for their own sins, but for sins others have been drawn into, and kept in, by them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The general prophecy of Moses <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-28.htm">Deuteronomy 29:28</a>, that the disobedient Israelites would be rooted up out of their land, and cast into another land, is here for the first time repeated, and is definitively applied to the ten tribes, which are to be removed "beyond the river" (the Euphrates, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24</a>), and "scattered."

It now revived, and became one of the most popular of the idolatries both in Israel and Judah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>, and compare the marginal references). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. the Lord shall raise him up a king &#8230; but what? even now&#8212;namely, Baasha (1Ki 15:27); he was already raised&#8212;he was in being, though not in power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To wit, by his invention, and making of the occasion of their sin, the calves; by his example, by encouraging those, and only those, that worshipped the calves; and by his authority, requiring and compelling them to do it. This is mentioned as a monstrous aggravation of his wickedness, that he was not content with his own sin, but was the great author and chief cause of drawing others into sin, and of corrupting and undoing the whole kingdom; which therefore God would never forgive him, nor forget him, but upon all occasions mentions him with this eternal brand of infamy upon him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he shall give Israel up,....

"In Israel," i.e., in the kingdom of the ten tribes. The threat is strengthened by the clause in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10</a>, "and I will sweep out after the house of Jeroboam, as one sweepeth out dung, even to the end," which expresses shameful and utter extermination; and this threat is still further strengthened in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-11.htm">1 Kings 14:11</a> by the threat added from <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-26.htm">Deuteronomy 28:26</a>, that of those cut off not one is to come to the grave, but their bodies are to be devoured by the dogs and birds of prey, - the worst disgrace that could befall the dead. Instead of wild beasts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-26.htm">Deuteronomy 28:26</a>) the dogs are mentioned here, because in the East they wander out in the streets without owners, and are so wild and ravenous that they even devour corpses (vid., Harmar, Beobachtungen, i. p. 198). &#1500;&#1497;&#1512;&#1489;&#1506;&#1501; with &#1500; of relationship, equivalent to of those related to Jeroboam.
