For, like Jeroboam, he had (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/16-2.htm" title="For as much as I exalted you out of the dust, and made you prince over my people Israel; and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam, and have made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;">1Kings 16:2-4</a>) a probation before God, in which he failed, drawing down doom on his house.<p><span class= "bld">But what? even now.</span>—The exact meaning of these words has been much disputed. The LXX. renders “and what? even now;” the Vulgate has “in this day and in this time;” the Chaldee Targum, “what is now, and what besides shall be.” Modern interpretations vary greatly. On the whole, perhaps, our version gives a not improbable rendering, and a simple and striking sense—“in that day; but what say I? the judgment is even now at hand.” (Comp. our Lord’s saying in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-49.htm" title="I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?">Luke 12:49</a> : “I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled? “)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-14.htm" title="Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.">1 Kings 14:14</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Lord shall raise him up a king — </span>This king was Baasha, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-27.htm" title="And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.">1 Kings 15:27</a>. <span class="ital">Who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day — </span>When he is so raised up, in the very beginning of his reign. <span class="ital">But what? </span>— Do I say <span class="ital">he shall raise, </span>as if it were a thing to be done at a great distance of time? The man is now in being, if not in power, who shall do this: this judgment shall be shortly executed. Sometimes God makes quick work with sinners. He did so with the house of Jeroboam. It was not twenty-four years from his first elevation to the final extirpation of his family.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:7-20 Whether we keep an account of God's mercies to us or not, he does; and he will set them in order before us, if we are ungrateful, to our greater confusion. Ahijah foretells the speedy death of the child then sick, in mercy to him. He only in the house of Jeroboam had affection for the true worship of God, and disliked the worship of the calves. To show the power and sovereignty of his grace, God saves some out of the worst families, in whom there is some good thing towards the Lord God of Israel. The righteous are removed from the evil to come in this world, to the good to come in a better world. It is often a bad sign for a family, when the best in it are buried out of it. Yet their death never can be a loss to themselves. It was a present affliction to the family and kingdom, by which both ought to have been instructed. God also tells the judgments which should come upon the people of Israel, for conforming to the worship Jeroboam established. After they left the house of David, the government never continued long in one family, but one undermined and destroyed another. Families and kingdoms are ruined by sin. If great men do wickedly, they draw many others, both into the guilt and punishment. The condemnation of those will be severest, who must answer, not only for their own sins, but for sins others have been drawn into, and kept in, by them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Hebrew text of this verse appears to be defective in this place.

[Rawlinson only expresses a general feeling when he says that "no satisfactory sense can be obtained from the Hebrew text," and suggests that it is corrupt or defective. The passage, no doubt, is one of extreme difficulty, and inasmuch as the MSS. and Versions lend us no aid to its interpretation, affords scope for conjecture. The explanation I venture to submit may, I hope, contribute - it can hardly do more - to the elucidation of the text. I observe that in ver. 13 <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> is used of Abijah, "this one alone," etc. I assume that it has the same import here, viz., "this one today," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "this one dies or is cut off today," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> being understood as constantly, adverbially, - <span class="accented">hodie</span> (see, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-14.htm">Genesis 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-14.htm">Genesis 22:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-24.htm">1 Kings 2:24</a>). It would be a natural reflection to the prophet who had just been speaking of the excision of the <span class="accented">house</span> of Jeroboam, "one perishes today, judgment is already begun," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> As to the rest, for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> I would read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, which has practically the same sound, and for which, consequently, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> is sometimes substituted by the transcriber, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-18.htm">1 Kings 1:18, 20</a>, and understand "And what wilt thou also do?" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, what will become of thee also? It is quite possible (ver. 11) that Jeroboam's wife perished in the wholesale destruction of his house, as it is clear from the severe punishment assigned to her (ver. 12) that she must have shared in his sin. The readiness with which she lent herself to this deceit (ver. 4) also favours the supposition that she had approved his policy. She would then have survived her husband only two years. Keil's explanation, "cut off the house of Jeroboam <span class="accented">this</span> day," appears contrary to actual fact, while to interpret "that day" (with the A.V.) is contrary to Hebrew grammar.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The saying was as follows: "Therefore, because thou hast exalted thyself from the people, and I have made thee prince over my people Israel (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-31.htm">1 Kings 11:31</a>), ... but thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments...(cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-34.htm">1 Kings 11:34</a>), and hast done worse than all who were before thee (judices nimirum et duces Israelis - Cler.), and hast gone and hast made thyself other gods (contrary to the express command in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2-3</a>), ... and hast cast me behind thy back: therefore I bring misfortune upon the house of Jeroboam," etc. The expression, to cast God behind the back, which only occurs here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-35.htm">Ezekiel 23:35</a>, denotes the most scornful contempt of God, the strict opposite of "keeping God before the eyes and in the heart." &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, every male person; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-22.htm">1 Samuel 25:22</a>.

"In Israel," i.e., in the kingdom of the ten tribes. The threat is strengthened by the clause in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10</a>, "and I will sweep out after the house of Jeroboam, as one sweepeth out dung, even to the end," which expresses shameful and utter extermination; and this threat is still further strengthened in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-11.htm">1 Kings 14:11</a> by the threat added from <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-26.htm">Deuteronomy 28:26</a>, that of those cut off not one is to come to the grave, but their bodies are to be devoured by the dogs and birds of prey, - the worst disgrace that could befall the dead. Instead of wild beasts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-26.htm">Deuteronomy 28:26</a>) the dogs are mentioned here, because in the East they wander out in the streets without owners, and are so wild and ravenous that they even devour corpses (vid., Harmar, Beobachtungen, i. p. 198). &#1500;&#1497;&#1512;&#1489;&#1506;&#1501; with &#1500; of relationship, equivalent to of those related to Jeroboam.
