His exaltation and the promise to him, his idolatry and its punishment, are all that the historian cares to narrate. All else is summed up in the words “how he warred” (see below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-30.htm" title="And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.">1Kings 14:30</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-6.htm" title="And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.">1Kings 15:6</a>) and “how he reigned.” It is probable that his reign was prosperous enough in peace and war, though his attempt to subdue Judah failed. (See 2 Chronicles 13) But all this the Scriptural record passes over, and only commemorates him as “Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-19.htm" title="And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.">1 Kings 14:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">Behold, they are written in the book of the Chronicles — </span>Not that canonical book of Chronicles, for that was written long after this book; but a book of civil records, the annals, wherein all remarkable passages were recorded by the king’s command from day to day; out of which the sacred penman, by the direction of God’s spirit, took those passages which were most useful for God’s honour, and men’s edification.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:7-20 Whether we keep an account of God's mercies to us or not, he does; and he will set them in order before us, if we are ungrateful, to our greater confusion. Ahijah foretells the speedy death of the child then sick, in mercy to him. He only in the house of Jeroboam had affection for the true worship of God, and disliked the worship of the calves. To show the power and sovereignty of his grace, God saves some out of the worst families, in whom there is some good thing towards the Lord God of Israel. The righteous are removed from the evil to come in this world, to the good to come in a better world. It is often a bad sign for a family, when the best in it are buried out of it. Yet their death never can be a loss to themselves. It was a present affliction to the family and kingdom, by which both ought to have been instructed. God also tells the judgments which should come upon the people of Israel, for conforming to the worship Jeroboam established. After they left the house of David, the government never continued long in one family, but one undermined and destroyed another. Families and kingdoms are ruined by sin. If great men do wickedly, they draw many others, both into the guilt and punishment. The condemnation of those will be severest, who must answer, not only for their own sins, but for sins others have been drawn into, and kept in, by them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The wars of Jeroboam may be divided into:<p>(1) his wars with Rehoboam (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-25.htm">1 Kings 14:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-30.htm">1 Kings 14:30</a>); and<p>(2) his war with Abijam (see the marginal reference).<p>The book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel - (of Judah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-29.htm">1 Kings 14:29</a>).

So with the Romans, from their very beginning to the times of Mutius, all the events of every year were committed to writing by the order of the Pontifex Maximus, and lay open to be read by the people in common; and these, as Tully (l) says, were what are called annals. <p>(l) De Oratore, l. 2. c. 34. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_kings/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">how he warred</span>] His war with Abijah king of Judah is spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/13-3.htm" title="And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valor....">2 Chronicles 13:3-20</a>. The history in that place describes Jeroboam’s defeat, and the loss of five thousand of his men, and the capture of several Israelite cities by the king of Judah.

He would die as soon as she entered the city, and of all the male members of the house of Jeroboam he only would receive the honour of a proper burial, because in him there was some good thing towards Jehovah found. Ewald (247, b.) regards the form &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1492; as standing for &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1492;&#1468;, and refers the suffix to the following word &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; (vid., Ewald, 309, c.). But as this use of the suffix would be very harsh, the question arises whether &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; is not to be regarded as a feminine form of the infinitive, after the analogy of &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-4.htm">Exodus 2:4</a> and &#1500;&#1491;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-3.htm">2 Kings 19:3</a>, etc. From the fulfilment of this declaration in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-17.htm">1 Kings 14:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-18.htm">1 Kings 14:18</a> Jeroboam was to learn that the threatened destruction of his royal house would also be just as certainly fulfilled. The sick son appears to have been the heir-presumptive to the throne. This may be inferred partly from the lamentation of all Israel at his death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-18.htm">1 Kings 14:18</a>), and partly from what follows here in the next verse. &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; means in his relation to Jehovah.</body></html>
