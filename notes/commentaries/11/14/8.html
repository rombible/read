Ahijah foretells the speedy death of the child then sick, in mercy to him. He only in the house of Jeroboam had affection for the true worship of God, and disliked the worship of the calves. To show the power and sovereignty of his grace, God saves some out of the worst families, in whom there is some good thing towards the Lord God of Israel. The righteous are removed from the evil to come in this world, to the good to come in a better world. It is often a bad sign for a family, when the best in it are buried out of it. Yet their death never can be a loss to themselves. It was a present affliction to the family and kingdom, by which both ought to have been instructed. God also tells the judgments which should come upon the people of Israel, for conforming to the worship Jeroboam established. After they left the house of David, the government never continued long in one family, but one undermined and destroyed another. Families and kingdoms are ruined by sin. If great men do wickedly, they draw many others, both into the guilt and punishment. The condemnation of those will be severest, who must answer, not only for their own sins, but for sins others have been drawn into, and kept in, by them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As Jeroboam's appointment to the kingdom had been formally announced to him by the prophet Ahijah, so the same prophet is commissioned to acquaint him with his forfeiture of it.

She was to go to Shiloh disguised, so as not to be recognised, to deceive the old prophet, because otherwise Jeroboam did not promise himself any favourable answer, as he had contemptuously neglected Ahijah's admonition (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-38.htm">1 Kings 11:38-39</a>). But he turned to this prophet because he had spoken concerning him &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, to be king, i.e., that he would become king, over this people. &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498; stands for &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, with which the infinitive esse can be omitted (vid., Ewald, 336, b.). As this prophecy, which was so favourable to Jeroboam, had come to pass (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-30</a>), he hoped that he might also obtain from Ahijah a divine revelation concerning the result of his son's illness, provided that he did not know who it was who came to seek counsel concerning her sick son. To complete the deception, she was to take with her as a present for the prophet (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-8.htm">1 Samuel 9:8</a>) "ten loaves and crumbs" and a jar with honey, i.e., a trifling gift such as a simple citizen's wife might take. According to the early versions and the context, a kind of plain cake, &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1; (lxx), crustulam (Vulg.).
