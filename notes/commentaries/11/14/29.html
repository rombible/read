The abounding of the worst crimes, of the worst of the heathen, in Jerusalem, the city the Lord had chosen for his temple and his worship, shows that nothing can mend the hearts of fallen men but the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit. On this alone may we depend; for this let us daily pray, in behalf of ourselves and all around us. The splendour of their temple, the pomp of their priesthood, and all the advantages with which their religion was attended, could not prevail to keep them close to it; nothing less than the pouring out the Spirit will keep God's Israel in their allegiance to him. Sin exposes, makes poor, and weakens any people. Shishak, king of Egypt, came and took away the treasures. Sin makes the gold become dim, changes the most fine gold, and turns it into brass.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It appears from this verse that Rehoboam, notwithstanding that he encouraged, and perhaps secretly practiced, idolatry (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-22.htm">1 Kings 14:22-24</a>, compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-3.htm">1 Kings 15:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-12.htm">1 Kings 15:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-1.htm">2 Chronicles 12:1</a>), maintained a public profession of faith in Yahweh, and attended in state the temple services.

Like the bamoth, in connection with which they generally occur, they were originally dedicated to Jehovah; but even under the law they were forbidden, partly as places of divine worship of human invention which easily degenerated into idolatry, but chiefly because the Canaanites had erected such monuments to Baal by the side of his altars (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-24.htm">Exodus 23:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-13.htm">Exodus 34:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-5.htm">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>, etc.), whereby the worship of Jehovah was unconsciously identified with the worship of Baal, even when the mazzeboth were not at first erected to the Canaanitish Baal. As the &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; of the Canaanites were dedicated to Baal, so were the &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; to Astarte, the female nature-deity of those tribes. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1492;, however, does not mean a grove (see the Comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-21.htm">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>), but an idol of the Canaanitish nature-goddess, generally most likely a lofty wooden pillar, though sometimes perhaps a straight trunk of a tree, the branches and crown of which were lopped off, and which was planted upon heights and in other places by the side of the altars of Baal. The name &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1492; was transferred from the idol to the goddess of nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-7.htm">2 Kings 21:7</a>, etc.), and was used of the image or column of the Phoenician Astarte (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-33.htm">1 Kings 16:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-6.htm">2 Kings 13:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-16.htm">2 Kings 17:16</a>, etc.), just as &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7</a> alternates with &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-13.htm">Judges 2:13</a>. These idols the Israelites (? Judaeans - Tr.) appear to have also associated with the worship of Jehovah; for the external worship of Jehovah was still maintained in the temple, and was performed by Rehoboam himself with princely pomp (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-28.htm">1 Kings 14:28</a>).
