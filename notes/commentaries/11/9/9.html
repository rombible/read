There it was made the ground for pleading with the Lord for His continued favour (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/8-51.htm" title="For they be your people, and your inheritance, which you brought forth out of Egypt, from the middle of the furnace of iron:">1Kings 8:51-53</a>); here for His claim of the undivided allegiance of the people, for it marked His new “covenant” with the people, now become a nation (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-32.htm" title="Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they broke, although I was an husband to them, said the LORD:">Jeremiah 31:32</a>), and therefore involved (as in all covenants) reciprocal claims. Afterwards the deliverance from Babylon was to take its place, both as a proof of God’s love and a motive for the loyal obedience of the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/16-14.htm" title="Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that it shall no more be said, The LORD lives, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;">Jeremiah 16:14-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/23-7.htm" title="Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that they shall no more say, The LORD lives, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;">Jeremiah 23:7-8</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-9 God warned Solomon, now he had newly built and dedicated the temple, that he and his people might not be high-minded, but fear. After all the services we can perform, we stand upon the same terms with the Lord as before. Nothing can purchase for us liberty to sin, nor would the true believer desire such a licence. He would rather be chastened of the Lord, than be allowed to go on with ease and prosperity in sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Hebrew text runs - "And this house shall be high: every one," etc. The meaning appears to be, "This house shall be high" (i. e., conspicuous) "in its ruin as in its glory."<p>And shall hiss - In contempt.

The record of this second vision, in which were rehearsed the conditions of God's covenant with Solomon and the consequences of breaking them, is inserted here as a proper introduction to the narrative about to be given of this king's commercial enterprises and ambitious desire for worldly glory; for this king, by encouraging an influx of foreign people and a taste for foreign luxuries, rapidly corrupted his own mind and that of this subjects, so that they turned from following God, they and their children (1Ki 9:6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they shall answer,....

SOLOMON'S BUILDINGS AND UNDERTAKINGS. - So far the historian has spoken exclusively of the two greatest works of Solomon's reign, the Temple and the Palace, and principally of the former. Even the message just related was, as we have seen, the response to the prayer offered when the temple was consecrated. But he now proceeds to mention other proofs of Solomon's greatness, and of the prosperity of his reign - doubtless because the glory of Israel then reached its climax, and the author would be tempted to linger over these details because of the dark contrast which his own time supplied - and this leads him to speak of the means by which all these enterprises were accomplished. The particulars here given are but fragmentary, and are grouped together in a somewhat irregular manner. It would seem as if both this account and that of the chronicler had been compiled from much more copious histories, each writer having cited those particulars which appeared to him to be the most interesting and important. But the design of the historian in either case is evident, viz., <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to recount the principal undertakings of this illustrious king, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to indicate the resources which   enabled him to accomplish such ambitious and extensive designs. These latter were <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the alliance with Hiram, which secured him the necessary materials (vers. 11-14); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the forced labour of the subject races (vers. 20-23); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the voyages of his fleet (vers. 26-28). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The divine promise to Solomon, that his prayer should be answered, is closely connected with the substance of the prayer; but in our account we have only a brief summary, whereas in the Chronicles it is given more elaborately (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-12.htm">2 Chronicles 7:12-16</a>). "I have sanctified this house which thou hast built, to put my name there." For the expression, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-11.htm">Deuteronomy 12:11</a>. The sanctifying consisted in the fact, that Jehovah put His name in the temple; i.e., that by filling the temple with the cloud which visibly displayed His presence, He consecrated it as the scene of the manifestation of His grace. To Solomon's prayer, "May Thine eyes stand open over this house" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a>), the Lord replies, giving always more than we ask, "My eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually." </body></html>
