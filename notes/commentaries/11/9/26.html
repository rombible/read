Let piety begin, and profit follow; leave pleasure to the last. Whatever pains we take for the glory of God, and to profit others, we are likely to have the advantage. Canaan, the holy land, the glory of all lands, had no gold in it; which shows that the best produce is that which is for the present support of life, our own and others; such things did Canaan produce.

Josephus says (x) in his time it was called Berenice, which is placed by Mela (y) between the Heroopolitic bay, and the promontory Strobilus, or Pharan. It is thought probable (z) to be the same with that which is called by the Arabs Meenah-el-Dsahab, the port of gold, called Dizahab, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-1.htm">Deuteronomy 1:1</a>, which stands upon the shore of the Arabic gulf, about two or three days' distance from Mount Sinai; though by others (a) thought to be the same the Arabs call Calzem, where was a great quantity of wood fit for building ships. It is further described, <p>which is beside Elath, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom; and when Edom was subdued by David, this port fell into his hands, and so was in the possession of Solomon; and there being plenty of timber in the parts adjacent, and this being a port in the Red sea, Solomon chose it as proper place to build ships in.

Ezion-geber is mentioned first in the narrative of the journey of the Israelites from Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-35.htm" title="And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Eziongaber.">Numbers 33:35</a>). It was the last halting-place before they entered the wilderness of Zin. It lay at the top of the gulf of Akabah. Here was also Eloth (<span class="ital">or</span> Elath) of which we read (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-22.htm" title="He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.">2 Kings 14:22</a>) that, though it is here said to be in the land of Edom, it was conquered for Judah at a later time, and still later (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-6.htm" title="At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelled there to this day.">2 Kings 16:6</a>) came into the possession of Rezin king of Syria.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In reference to this navy, we are told (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-18.htm" title="And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took there four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.">2 Chronicles 8:18</a>) that Hiram sent Solomon the ships. Putting that passage side by side with this, it can only mean that the wood for ship-building was brought from Tyre along the coast as far as was necessary, and then at the nearest point carried over land to the Gulf of Akabah, where the ships were built. The only other interpretation of the statement in 2 Chronicles would be that Hiram sent ships from Tyre round Africa and then by the Indian Ocean into the Red Sea, which cannot for a moment be supposed.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And king Solomon made a navy of ships</span> [Heb. <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, a collective noun, <span class="accented">classis</span>. The chronicler paraphrases by <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, plural. This fact finds a record here, probably because it was to the voyages of this fleet that the king was indebted for the gold which enabled him to erect and adorn the buildings recently described. (As to form, etc., of the ships, see Dict. Bib. 2. p. 1014). But no historian could pass over without notice an event of such profound importance to Israel as the construction of its first ships, which, next to the temple, was the great event of Solomon's reign] <span class="cmt_word">in Ezion-geber</span> [lit., the <span class="accented">backbone of a man</span> (or <span class="accented">giant</span>). Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-35.htm">Numbers 33:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-8.htm">Deuteronomy 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-22.htm">2 Kings 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-17.htm">2 Chronicles 8:17</a>. The name is probably due, like Shechem (see note on 1 Kings 12:25) to a real or fancied resemblance in the physical geography of the country to that part of the human body. Stanley (S. and P. p. 84) speaks of "the jagged ranges on each side of the gulf." <span class="accented">Akaba</span>, the modern name, also means <span class="accented">back</span>. 2 Chronicles <span class="accented">l.c.</span> says Solomon went to Ezion-geber, which it is highly probable he would do], <span class="cmt_word">which is beside</span> [Heb. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>   =  aloud (Gesen., Lex. <span class="accented">s.v.</span>)] <span class="cmt_word">Eloth</span> [lit., <span class="accented">trees</span> akin to Elim, where were <span class="accented">palm</span> trees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-27.htm">Exodus 15:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-1.htm">Exodus 16:1</a>). The name is interesting as suggesting that Solomon may have found some of the timber for the construction of his fleet here. A grove of palm trees "still exists at the head of the gulf of Akaba" (Stanley S. and P. p. 20). Palms, it is true, are not adapted to shipbuilding, but other timber may have grown there in a past age. But see note on ver. 27. For Elath, see Porter, p. 40; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-8.htm">Deuteronomy 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a> (which shows how it passed into the hand of Israel); <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-22.htm">2 Kings 14:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-6.htm">2 Kings 16:6</a>.

"Fragments of red coral are forever being thrown up from the stores below, and it is these coral-line forests which form the true 'weeds' of this fantastic sea" (Stanley, S. and P. p. 83). There is also apparently a bottom of red sandstone (<span class="accented">ib</span>. p. 6, note). It is divided by the Sinaitic peninsula into two arms or gulfs, the western being the Gulf of Suez, and the eastern the Gulf of Akabah. The former is 130 miles, the latter 90 miles long], <span class="cmt_word">in the land of Edom</span>. [The subjugation of Edom is mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a>.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The "magazine-cities" (&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;) were fortified cities, in which the produce of the land was collected, partly for provisioning the army, and partly for the support of the rural population in times of distress (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-12.htm">2 Chronicles 17:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-28.htm">2 Chronicles 32:28</a>), similar to those which Pharaoh had built in the land of Goshen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a>). If they were situated on the great commercial roads, they may also have served for storing provisions for the necessities of travellers and their beasts of burden. The cities for the war-chariots (&#1492;&#1512;&#1499;&#1489;) and cavalry (&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;) were probably in part identical with the magazine-cities, and situated in different parts of the kingdom. There were no doubt some of these upon Lebanon, as we may on the one hand infer from the general importance of the northern frontier to the security of the whole kingdom, and still more from the fact that Solomon had an opponent at Damascus in the person of Rezin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-24.htm">1 Kings 11:24</a>), who could easily stir up rebellion in the northern provinces, which had only just been incorporated by David into the kingdom; and as we may on the other hand clearly gather from <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-4.htm">2 Chronicles 16:4</a>, according to which there were magazine-cities in the land of Naphtali. Finally, the words "and what Solomon had a desire to build" embrace all the rest of his buildings, which it would have occupied too much space to enumerate singly. That the words &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511; &#1488;&#1514; are not to be so pressed as to be made to denote simply "the buildings undertaking for pure pleasure," like the works mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:4</a>., as Thenius and Bertheau suppose, is evident from a comparison of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-1.htm">1 Kings 9:1</a>, where all Solomon's buildings except the temple and palace, and therefore the fortifications as well as others, are included in the expression "all his desire." - Fuller particulars concerning the tributary workmen are given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20</a>. The Canaanitish population that was left in the land were made use of for this purpose, - namely, the descendants of the Canaanites who had not been entirely exterminated by the Israelites. "Their children," etc., supplies a more precise definition of the expression "all the people," etc., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20</a>.</body></html>
