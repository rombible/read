Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee&#8212;According to Josephus, they were situated on the northwest of it, adjacent to Tyre. Though lying within the boundaries of the promised land (Ge 15:18; Jos 1:4), they had never been conquered till then, and were inhabited by Canaanite heathens (Jud 4:2-13; 2Ki 15:29). They were probably given to Hiram, whose dominions were small, as a remuneration for his important services in furnishing workmen, materials, and an immense quantity of wrought gold (1Ki 9:14) for the temple and other buildings [Michaelis]. The gold, however, as others think, may have been the amount of forfeits paid to Solomon by Hiram for not being able to answer the riddles and apothegms, with which, according to Josephus, in their private correspondence, the two sovereigns amused themselves. Hiram having refused these cities, probably on account of their inland situation making them unsuitable to his maritime and commercial people, Solomon satisfied his ally in some other way; and, taking these cities into his own hands, he first repaired their shattered walls, then filled them with a colony of Hebrews (2Ch 8:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Or, <span class="ital">near</span> (as <span class="ital">beth</span> oft signifies, as hath been proved before) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the land of Galilee, </span> bordering upon it; in those parts which were near and adjoining to Hiram’s dominions: with the cities understand the lands and territories belonging to them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Quest.</span> How could Solomon give away any part of that land wherein the people had a right by a Divine lot, and God had a right, as being the only proprietary of it; upon which ground the total alienation of it, or any part of it, was forbidden, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-23.htm" title="The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for you are strangers and sojourners with me.">Leviticus 25:23</a></span>? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> 1.
