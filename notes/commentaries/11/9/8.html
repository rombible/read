The true meaning is certainly “This house shall be high;” which is the reading of the LXX., while the Vulg. has a good explanatory gloss, “This house shall be for an example.” Various corrections have been proposed, but there seems no necessity for them. There is evidently an allusion to the lofty position of the Temple. Generally the exaltation of “the mountain of the Lord” is made a type of its glory (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/4-1.htm" title="But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow to it.">Micah 4:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/68-15.htm" title="The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill of Bashan.">Psalm 68:15-16</a>, &c.); here of its destruction. Its magnificence and its ruin are equally conspicuous: for “a city set on a hill cannot be hid.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/9-8.htm" title="And at this house, which is high, every one that passes by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why has the LORD done thus to this land, and to this house?...">1 Kings 9:8-9</a>. </span><span class="ital">And at this house, which is high — </span>Exalted in its privileges, and renowned for its riches and splendour, and the great resort of people to it. They gloried in the stateliness and magnificence of the structure; but God here lets them know it was not so high as to be out of the reach of his judgments, which should assuredly fall upon it and them, if they vilified it so as to exchange it for groves and idol-temples, and yet, at the same time, most inconsistently and absurdly magnified it, so as to suppose it would secure the favour of God to them, although they ever so much corrupted themselves. <span class="ital">Every one that passeth by it shall be astonished — </span>At its unexpected and wonderful ruin. As they who now pass by it are astonished at the bulk and beauty, the richness, contrivance, and workmanship of it, and call it a stupendous fabric; so, if you forsake God, its height will make its fall the more amazing, and they that pass by will be as much astonished at its ruins. <span class="ital">And shall hiss — </span>By way of contempt and derision; <span class="ital">and shall say, Why hath the Lord, </span>&c. — What is the reason that this famous place, which boasted so much of the favour and protection of God, is thus laid in ruins? <span class="ital">And they shall answer, Because they forsook, </span>&c. — The guilty, self-convicted, self-condemned Israelites will be forced to acknowledge with shame, that they themselves were the ruin of it.

Their sin will be read in their punishment. They deserted the temple, and therefore God deserted it; they profaned it with their sins, and laid it common; and therefore God profaned it with his judgments, and laid it waste.

After all the services we can perform, we stand upon the same terms with the Lord as before. Nothing can purchase for us liberty to sin, nor would the true believer desire such a licence. He would rather be chastened of the Lord, than be allowed to go on with ease and prosperity in sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Hebrew text runs - "And this house shall be high: every one," etc. The meaning appears to be, "This house shall be high" (i. e., conspicuous) "in its ruin as in its glory."<p>And shall hiss - In contempt.

The record of this second vision, in which were rehearsed the conditions of God's covenant with Solomon and the consequences of breaking them, is inserted here as a proper introduction to the narrative about to be given of this king's commercial enterprises and ambitious desire for worldly glory; for this king, by encouraging an influx of foreign people and a taste for foreign luxuries, rapidly corrupted his own mind and that of this subjects, so that they turned from following God, they and their children (1Ki 9:6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Which is high, </span> i.e. exalted in its privileges, glorious, and renowned.

The Hebrew text, standing alone, must be rendered ‘And this house shall be high.’ But in 2 Chron. the relative is expressed, and there can be little doubt that the text here is somehow faulty. The passage in 2 Chron. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-21.htm" title="And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.">1 Kings 7:21</a>) reads ‘And this house which is high shall be an astonishment.’ To come as near to this sense as possible, while introducing no relative, R.V. gives ‘<span class="bld">And though this house be high</span>.’ Yet that rendering is somewhat doubtful. The text of the LXX. shows that they had our Hebrew before them: <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὁ οἶκος οὖτος ἔσται ὁ ὑψηλός</span>, <span class="greekheb">πᾶς ὁ διαπορευόμενος κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And at this house, which is high</span> [Heb., <span class="accented">And</span> <span class="accented">this house shall be high</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d4;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>. Our translators were probably influenced by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-21.htm">2 Chronicles 7:21</a>, the text of which is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> which would seem to be an emendation, designed to clear up the difficulty rather than an accidental variation of the text. But here the literal rendering is probably the truer, the meaning being "this house shall be conspicuous, as an example" - so the Vulg. <span class="accented">domus haec erit in exemplum</span>. The LXX. accords with the Hebrew text, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f50;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, but the Syriac and Arabic read, "this house shall be destroyed." Keil sees in the words an allusion <span class="accented">implicite</span> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-19.htm">Deuteronomy 26:19</a>, and Deuteronomy 28:1, where God promises to make <span class="accented">Israel</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, and says "the blessing will be turned into a curse." The temple should indeed be "high," should be what Israel would have been, but it shall be as a <span class="accented">warning</span>, etc.; but this connexion is somewhat far fetched and artificial. Thenius would read for, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>. "ruins," after <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-18.htm">Jeremiah 26:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-1.htm">Psalm 79:1</a>; but it is hardly right to resort to conjectures, unsupported by a single version or MS., so long as any sufficient meaning can be extracted from the words as they stand, and no one can deny that "high" may surely signify "conspicuous." Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-23.htm">Matthew 11:23</a>], <span class="cmt_word">every one that passeth by it shall be astonished</span>. [<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> primarily means to be <span class="accented">dumb</span> with astonishment, Gesen., Thessalonians 3. p. 1435] <span class="cmt_word">and shall hiss</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>, like "hiss," is an onomatopoetic word. It does not denote the hissing of <span class="accented">terror</span> (Bahr) but of derision; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-17.htm">Jeremiah 49:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-23.htm">Job 27:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15, 16</a>. Rawlinson aptly remarks, as bearing on the authorship of the Kings, that this is a familiar word in Jeremiah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-16.htm">1 Kings 18:16</a>; 25:9; 29:18; 50:13; 51:37, in addition to the passages cited above), and that the other prophets rarely use it. The fact that much of this charge is in Jeremiah's style, confirms the view taken above (note on ver. 4), that the <span class="accented">ipsissima verba</span> of the dream are not preserved to us. The author indeed could hardly do more than preserve its leading ideas, which he would naturally present in his own dress]; <span class="cmt_word">and they shall say, Why hath the Lord done thus unto this land and to this house?</span> [Similar words <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-24.htm">Deuteronomy 29:24, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-8.htm">Jeremiah 22:8</a>.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Answer of the Lord to Solomon's Dedicatory Prayer (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-11.htm">2 Chronicles 7:11-22</a>). - <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-1.htm">1 Kings 9:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-2.htm">1 Kings 9:2</a>.
