And David built round about from Millo and inward.">2Samuel 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-8.htm" title="And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.">1Chronicles 11:8</a>). That it was a part of the fortification of “the city of David” is clear by this passage, by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-24.htm" title="But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.">1Kings 9:24</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-27.htm" title="And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.">1Kings 11:27</a>, and by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-5.htm" title="Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.">2Chronicles 32:5</a>; and the LXX. invariably renders it “Acra,” or “the-citadel,” a name always applied in the later history to the fortification on Mount Zion. Josephus, in describing the works of Solomon, merely says that he made the walls of David higher and stronger, and built towers on them. From the derivation of the word it is possible that the work was the raising a high fortification of earth crowned with a wall, where the hill of Zion slopes down unto the valley known subsequently as the <span class= "ital">Tyropœon</span>.<p><span class= "bld">Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.</span>—These cities were all of important geographical positions, and all had belonged to the subject races.<p><span class= "bld">Hazor</span> was in the north, on high ground near the waters of Merom. It had been the city of Jabin, head of the northern confederacy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,">Joshua 11:1</a>). After the great victory over this confederacy, Joshua burnt Hazor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-13.htm" title="But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.">Joshua 11:13</a>), and the territory was assigned to Naphtali (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-36.htm" title="And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,">Joshua 19:36</a>). But it must have been regained by its old possessors, and rebuilt, for it appears again under another Jabin in Judges 4. It was evidently important, as commanding the great line of invasion through Hamath from the north. Hence it was fortified by Solomon, and probably the native inhabitants were dispossessed.<p><span class= "bld">Megiddo</span> lay in the great plain of Jezreel or Esdraelon, the battle-field of Northern Palestine, commanding some of the passes from it into the hill country of Manasseh, to which tribe it was assigned after the conquest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-11.htm" title="And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries.">Joshua 17:11</a>). But it was not subdued by them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/17-12.htm" title="Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.">Joshua 17:12-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/1-27.htm" title="Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.">Judges 1:27-28</a>), and, with Taanach, appears as a hostile city in the Song of Deborah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-19.htm" title="The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.">Judges 5:19</a>). Now it was fortified, and is named subsequently as an Israelite city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-27.htm" title="But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.">2Kings 9:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm" title="In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.">2Kings 23:29</a>). In later times the Romans seem to have occupied it, and their name for it, <span class= "ital">Legio</span> (now <span class= "ital">el-Łejjûr</span>), superseded the old title.<p><span class= "bld">Grezer </span>or <span class= "bld">Gazer</span>, was near Bethlehem, close to the maritime plain. Its king was conquered by Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-33.htm" title="Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.">Joshua 10:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-12.htm" title="The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;">Joshua 12:12</a>), and the city was allotted to the Levites in the territory of Ephraim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-17.htm" title="And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba with her suburbs,">Joshua 21:17</a>), but it remained unsubdued (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-29.htm" title="Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelled in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelled in Gezer among them.">Judges 1:29</a>). From the notice in the next verse, it must have been in rebellion against Israel, perhaps in the early and more troubled days of Solomon; and was accordingly taken by the Egyptian army (which could easily march up the plain, and attack it therefrom). The passes here were of critical importance, as appears in the Philistine wars (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-4.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.">1Chronicles 20:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-25.htm" title="And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gazer.">2Samuel 5:25</a>), in relation to any advance from the plain.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm" title="And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.">1 Kings 9:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">This is the reason of the levy, </span>&c. — That the raising of a great tribute upon the people, and employing so many men in his works, might not seem strange, the sacred writer here shows the cause of it; which was, his great and numerous buildings, suitable to the high dignity to which God had advanced him. The Hebrew word, <span class="greekheb">מס</span>, <span class="ital">mass, </span>here rendered levy, as Mr. Selden hath shown, by many instances, is not only used for pecuniary tribute, but also for bodily labour; it means a levy of men as well as a levy of money. And he thus interprets this clause: <span class="ital">This is the cause of requiring the labour of so many men; it was to build, </span>&c. Having thus declared the cause, the historian proceeds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-20.htm" title="And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,">1 Kings 9:20</a>) to relate who they were that he employed in this service. <span class="ital">And Millo — </span>David had built <span class="ital">round about Zion, from Millo inward, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-9.htm" title="So David dwelled in the fort, and called it the city of David.

Here, it is thought, the people of Israel assembled when there was any consultation to be made about public affairs.

Let piety begin, and profit follow; leave pleasure to the last. Whatever pains we take for the glory of God, and to profit others, we are likely to have the advantage. Canaan, the holy land, the glory of all lands, had no gold in it; which shows that the best produce is that which is for the present support of life, our own and others; such things did Canaan produce.

Solomon therefore had to "repair the breaches of the city of David" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a>.<p>Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer were three of the most important sites in the holy land. For the two first places, compare the marginal references and notes.<p>Gezer was a main city of the south.

Though within the lot of Ephraim <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/16-3.htm">Joshua 16:3</a>, and especially assigned to the Kohathite Levites <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/21-21.htm">Joshua 21:21</a>, it had never yet been conquered from the old inhabitants (marginal references), who continued to dwell in it until Solomon's time, and apparently were an independent people <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-16.htm">1 Kings 9:16</a>.<p>Pharaoh took it before the marriage of Solomon with his daughter, and gave it "for a present" - i. e., for a dowry. Though in the East husbands generally pay for their wives, yet dower is given in some cases.

For this reason no doubt Solomon fortified it, but it must have already been rebuilt since its destruction by Joshua, for we read of it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-2.htm" title="And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelled in Harosheth of the Gentiles.">Jdg 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-17.htm" title="However, Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.">Jdg 4:17</a>, as the city of another Jabin, whose commander in chief was Sisera, slain by Jael.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Megiddo</span>] This city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-21.htm" title="The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;">Joshua 12:21</a>) lay on the south side of the plain of Esdraelon, between Mt. Tabor and the modern bay of St Jean d’Acre, and must have been important as a protection against inroads from the northern highlands and from the direction of Phœnicia, commanding, as it would, the great road from the sea to the plain of the Jordan. Megiddo lay within the tribe of Issachar, but was allotted to Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-11.htm" title="And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries.">Joshua 17:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-29.htm" title="And by the borders of the children of Manasseh, Bethshean and her towns, Taanach and her towns, Megiddo and her towns, Dor and her towns. In these dwelled the children of Joseph the son of Israel.">1 Chronicles 7:29</a>). The city was famous for the overthrow of Sisera, but most especially as the place where king Josiah was slain in the war against Pharaoh-Necho (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm" title="In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.">2 Kings 23:29</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Gezer</span>] The position of this ancient city has not been identified, and it is not clear that there were not two places of the same name. One Gezer is mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-33.htm" title="Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.">Joshua 10:33</a>) in connexion with Lachish and Eglon and other places in the south part of Canaan, but a Gezer is also spoken of as in the land assigned to the children of Joseph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-3.htm" title="And goes down westward to the coast of Japhleti, to the coast of Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer; and the goings out thereof are at the sea.">Joshua 16:3</a>), that is, the tribe of Ephraim, and as being not far from Beth-horon. If these two be references to the same place the king of Gezer came a long distance to help the king of Lachish. It seems more likely that they were distinct towns. The Gezer in Ephraim did however remain in the possession of the Canaanites (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-10.htm" title="And they drove not out the Canaanites that dwelled in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites to this day, and serve under tribute.">Joshua 16:10</a>), and so the king of Egypt may have come against it (as we read in the next verse) without being at war with Israel. Yet the fortification by Solomon of a place to protect his dominions on the south makes it perhaps a little more probable that some place nearer Eglon and Lachish is meant in the present passage, for there Canaanites might also be dwelling.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> And this is the reason [or manner, account, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>. Keil: "This is the case with regard to," etc. The historian now proceeds to speak of the forced labour. The LXX. inserts this and the next nine verses after <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>] of the levy [see on 1 Kings 5:13, and 1 Kings 12:18] which Solomon raised; for to build [The punctuation of the A.V. is misleading. The Hebrew has no break - "which Solomon raised for building," etc.] the house of the Lord and his own house and Millo [Heb. invariably, the Millo, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a>; LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>. The import of the word is much disputed, but Wordsworth has but slight warrant for say. ing that it means fortress. According to some it is an archaic Canaanitish term, "adopted by the Israelites when they took the town and incorporated into their own nomenclature" (Dict. Bib. 2. p. 367), an idea which finds some support in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6, 20</a>. Mr. Grove would further see in it a name for Mount Zion, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> being the invariable designation of that part of the city in the Maccabees. But see Joshua, B. J. 5:04.1; Ant. 15:11.5; and Porter, 1. pp. 96, 109. Lewin ("Siege of Jerusalem," p. 256) identifies it with the great platform on which temple and palace alike were built. But the word yields a definite meaning in the (  =  aolm], "the filling in"). Gesenius Hebrew consequently understands it to mean, a rampart (agger) because this is built up and filled in with stones, earth, etc. And the name would have a special fitness if we might suppose that it was applied to that part of the wall of Jerusalem which crossed the Tyropaeon valley. This ravine, which practically divided the city into two parts, would have been the weakest spot in the line of circumvallation, unless it were partly filled in - it is now completely choked up by debris, etc. - and protected by special fortifications; and, if this were done, and we can hardly doubt it was done (see on 1 Kings 11:27), Hammillo, "the filling in," would be its natural and appropriate name. And its mention, here and elsewhere, in connexion with the wall, lends some support to this view] and the wall of Jerusalem [We learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a> that David had already built Millo and the wall. Rawlinson argues from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a> that these repairs had been "hasty, and had now - fifty years later - fallen into decay," and that Solomon renewed them. More probably the words indicate an enlargement of the Tyropaeon rampart, and an extension of the walls. See note there and on chap. 3:1. Solomon, no doubt, wished to strengthen the defences of the capital, on which he had expended so much labour, and where there was so much to tempt the rapacity of predatory neighbours] and Hazor [For the defence of the kingdom he built a chain of fortresses "to form a sort of girdle round the land" (Ewald). The first mentioned, Hazor, was a place of great importance in earlier times, being the "head of all those (the northern) kingdoms" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-10.htm">Joshua 11:10</a>). It stood on an eminence - as indeed, for the sake of security, did all the cities of that lawless age (ib., ver. 13 marg.) - overlooking Lake Merom. It was at no great distance from the north boundary of Palestine, in Naphtali (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-36.htm">Joshua 19:36</a>), and being favoured by position, it was strongly fortified - Hazor means fortress - and hence Joshua made a point of destroying it. It appears, however, to have speedily regained its importance, for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2, 17</a> we find it as the capital of Jabin, king of Canaan. It was selected by Solomon as the best site for a stronghold, which should protect his northern border, and as commanding the approach from  Syria. As it is not mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>, it would appear to have escaped in the invasion of Benhadad. Possibly it was too strong for him] and Megiddo [<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-21.htm">Joshua 12:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>. This place was chosen partly because of its central position - it stood on the margin of the plain of Esdraelon, the battlefield of Palestine, and the battles fought there prove its strategical importance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-1.htm">1 Samuel 31:1</a>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>; Judith 3:9, 10 - and partly, perhaps, because the high road from Egypt to Damascus passed through it. It dominated the passes of Ephraim (see Judith 4:7). It has till recently been identified with el-Lejjun (from Legio. Compare our Chester, etc.) (Robinson, 2:116 sqq.; Stanley, S. and P., p. 347; Porter, 286, 287); but Conder ("Tent-work," p. 67) gives good reasons for fixing the site at the "large ruins between Jezreel and Bethshean, which still bears the name of Mujedd'a, i.e., on the eastern side of the plain] and Gezer [This commanded the approach from Egypt, and would protect the southern frontier of Solomon's kingdom. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-33.htm">Joshua 10:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-12.htm">Joshua 12:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-21.htm">Joshua 21:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-29.htm">Judges 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-25.htm">2 Samuel 5:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-4.htm">1 Chronicles 20:4</a>. It stands on the great maritime plain, and is also on the coast road between Egypt and Jerusalem. The site was identified (in 1874) by M. Clermont Ganneau with Tell Jezer. The name means "cut off," "isolated" (Gesen.) "The origin of the title is at once clear, for the site is an out-lier - to use a geological term - of the main line of hills and the position commands one of the important passes to Jerusalem" (Conder, p. 6). The mention of Gezer leads to a parenthesis of considerable length (vers. 16-19). The question of the levy is put aside for the time, whilst the historian explains how it was that the king came to build Gezer. He then proceeds to mention the other towns built during the same reign. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-4.htm">1 Kings 9:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-5.htm">1 Kings 9:5</a> contain the special answer to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-25.htm">1 Kings 8:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-26.htm">1 Kings 8:26</a>. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-6.htm">1 Kings 9:6-9</a> refer to the prayer for the turning away of the curse, to which the Lord replies: If ye and your children turn away from me, and do not keep my commandments, but worship other gods, this house will not protect you from the curses threatened in the law, but they will be fulfilled in all their terrible force upon you and upon this temple.
