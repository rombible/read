Josephus evidently did not know it as a Hebrew word; for he expressly says, that in the Phænician language it signifies “what is unpleasing.” (<span class= "ital">Ant. viii.</span> 100:5, sect. 3). A city Cabul is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-27.htm" title="And turns toward the sun rise to Bethdagon, and reaches to Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthahel toward the north side of Bethemek, and Neiel, and goes out to Cabul on the left hand,">Joshua 19:27</a>, in the territory of Asher, evidently on the Tyrian frontier, and in the neighbourhood in question. Hiram, it is thought, takes up this name, and applies it to the whole territory, and by a play of words on it signifies his discontent with Solomon’s gift. Ewald supposes a Hebrew derivation for the word (“as nought”); others take it to be “like that which vanishes.” Either would suit the sense indicated in the text well; but unless these derivations represent something cognate in the Tyrian language, they hardly accord with the requirements of this passage, which (as Josephus says) implies a Phoenician origin for the word.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:10-14 Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities.

Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee&#8212;According to Josephus, they were situated on the northwest of it, adjacent to Tyre. Though lying within the boundaries of the promised land (Ge 15:18; Jos 1:4), they had never been conquered till then, and were inhabited by Canaanite heathens (Jud 4:2-13; 2Ki 15:29). They were probably given to Hiram, whose dominions were small, as a remuneration for his important services in furnishing workmen, materials, and an immense quantity of wrought gold (1Ki 9:14) for the temple and other buildings [Michaelis]. The gold, however, as others think, may have been the amount of forfeits paid to Solomon by Hiram for not being able to answer the riddles and apothegms, with which, according to Josephus, in their private correspondence, the two sovereigns amused themselves. Hiram having refused these cities, probably on account of their inland situation making them unsuitable to his maritime and commercial people, Solomon satisfied his ally in some other way; and, taking these cities into his own hands, he first repaired their shattered walls, then filled them with a colony of Hebrews (2Ch 8:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The land of Cabul, </span> i.e. <span class="ital">of dirt</span>, as most interpret it. Not that it was a barren soil, as some imagine; for they who describe those parts commend them as fruitful; nor would Solomon have made him so unworthy a return: but because it was not pleasant, nor agreeable to his nor to his people’s humour; because, though the land was very good, yet being a thick and stiff clay, and therefore requiring great pains to manure and improve it, it was very unsuitable to the disposition of the Tyrians, who were delicate, and lazy, and luxurious, and wholly given to merchandise. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said,.... By letter to him: <p>what cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? so he called him, being not only his neighbour, but his ally, in friendship and covenant with him; and this he said of them not by way of complaint, or contempt, as unworthy of his acceptance; for so munificent a prince as Solomon would never offer to a king to whom he was so much obliged anything mean and contemptible; but as being unsuitable to him, however valuable they might be in themselves, or of advantage to others: <p>and he called them the land of Cabul unto this day; or rather the words should be rendered impersonally, "they were called so"; for Hiram could not call them by this name to the times of the writer of this book; nor is there any reason to think he would give them any name at all, and much less a contemptible one, as this is thought to be, when he did not choose to accept of them. Some interpret (g) the word shut up, or unfruitful, sandy, dirty, clayey; so in the Talmud (h) it is said to be a sandy land, and called Cabul, because a man's foot was plunged in it up to his ankles, and is represented as unfruitful. Josephus (i) says, in the Phoenician tongue it signifies "not pleasing", which agrees with what Hiram says, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-12.htm">1 Kings 9:12</a>. Hillerus (k) interprets it "as nothing", they being as nothing to Hiram, of no use to him, whatever they might be to others; and therefore he restored them to Solomon, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-2.htm">2 Chronicles 8:2</a>, which seems to be the best sense of the word. They are the same with Decapolis, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-25.htm">Matthew 4:25</a> so called from ten cities therein (l). <p>(g) David de Pomis, Lexic fol. 58. 2.((h) T. Bab.

The language of Josephus is ‘he said to Solomon that he did not want the cities.’ They are just alluded to in Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-2.htm" title="That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.">2 Chronicles 8:2</a>) as ‘the cities which Huram restored to Solomon.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">my brother</span>] This form of address between persons of royal rank has been always common. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/20-32.htm" title="So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Your servant Benhadad said, I pray you, let me live.

It need not necessarily imply friendly feeling.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And he called them</span>] Or the Hebrew may mean ‘and one called them’ which was a common form to signify ‘they were called.’ We need not therefore of necessity impute the contemptuous name to Hiram. Josephus gives <span class="greekheb">προσηγορεύθησαν</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the land of Cabul</span>] This appellation was given to indicate, what is stated in the text, that they were unsatisfactory. But it is not easy to know whence the name comes. There is a town so called in Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-27.htm" title="And turns toward the sun rise to Bethdagon, and reaches to Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthahel toward the north side of Bethemek, and Neiel, and goes out to Cabul on the left hand,">Joshua 19:27</a>) which was situated in the tribe of Asher. This tribe was in North Galilee but there would be no significance in the name, if it were already that of one of the twenty cities given to Hiram. The LXX. appears to have taken <span class="greekheb">כבול</span> (<span class="ital">Cabul</span>) to be the same as <span class="greekheb">נבול</span> (<span class="ital">gebul</span>) for they render the name <span class="greekheb">Ὅριον</span>, a boundary. Josephus transliterates by <span class="greekheb">Χαβαλών</span>, and adds that this word in Phœnician means ‘not pleasing,’ an interpretation, as it seems, which he evolved from the context. Some of the Hebrew commentators have connected the name with a verb which in Aramaic signifies ‘to bind,’ and have explained that the district was sandy or muddy, and that the feet were always deep sunk in the mire. A later derivation has taken the word to mean ‘worth nothing,’ as if from <span class="greekheb">כ</span> = <span class="ital">as</span>, and <span class="greekheb">בול = בל</span> = <span class="ital">nothing</span>. There are many other attempts at explanation but none that can be pronounced satisfactory.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, What cities</span> are <span class="cmt_word">these which thou hast given me, my brother?</span> [Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-32.htm">1 Kings 20:32</a>. It would seem, at first sight, as if this form of speech was then, as now, the usage of courts. But the <span class="accented">Fellahin</span> of Palestine, the "modern Canaanites," still address each other as "my father" or "my brother." See Conder, "Tent-work," p. 332]. <span class="cmt_word">And he called them the land of Cabul</span> [The meaning of this word is quite uncertain. The LXX. reads <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which shows that they must have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>; indeed, it is possible that the words have the same meaning (Gesen.) Stanley (S. and P. p. 364) thinks these cities formed the <span class="accented">boundary</span> between the two kingdoms, and refers to the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-21.htm">Matthew 15:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-17.htm">Luke 6:17</a>, etc. According to Josephus, <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, is a Phoenician word, meaning <span class="accented">displeasing</span>; but his etymologies are to be received with caution, and Gesenius justly pronounces this a mere conjecture from the context. Thenius and Ewald regard the word as compounded of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span> <span class="accented">  =   as nothing</span>; Keil connects it with the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span>, which would yield the meaning <span class="accented">pawned</span> or <span class="accented">pledged</span>, and hence concludes that, this strip of territory was merely given to Hiram as a security for the repayment of a loan (see below on ver. 14); while Bahr derives it from <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span>, an unused root, akin to the preceding - <span class="accented">vinxit, constrinxit</span>, and would see in it a name bestowed on the region because of its <span class="accented">confined</span> geographical position. He does not understand the word, however, as a term of contempt. "How," he asks, "could Hiram give the district a permanent name which contained a mockery of himself rather than of the land?" But the word was obviously an expression of disparagement, if not disgust, which, falling from Hiram's lips, was caught up and repeated with a view to mark not so much his displeasure as Solomon's meanness. But it is not necessary to find a meaning for the word, for it is to be considered that a city Bearing this name existed at that time and in this neighbourhood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-27.htm">Joshua 19:27</a>), the site of which, in all probability, is marked by the modern <span class="accented">Kabul</span>, eight miles east of Accho  (Robinson, 3:87, 88; Dict. Bib. 1:237; Thomson, "Land and Book," 1:281, 511). It is possible, indeed, that it may have been one of the "twenty cities" (ver. 11) given to Hiram. And if this city, whether within or without the district of Galilee, were notorious for its poverty or meanness, or conspicuous by its bleak situation, we can at once understand why Hiram should transfer the name to the adjoining region, even if that name, in itself, had no special significance] unto this day.
