Yet the essence of the covenant with David was kept in that preservation of the diminished kingdom to an unbroken succession of his descendants—singularly contrasted with the changes of dynasty in the greater rival kingdom—which is expressly declared to have been granted “for David’s sake” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/11-12.htm" title="Notwithstanding in your days I will not do it for David your father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of your son.">1Kings 11:12-13</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-9 God warned Solomon, now he had newly built and dedicated the temple, that he and his people might not be high-minded, but fear. After all the services we can perform, we stand upon the same terms with the Lord as before. Nothing can purchase for us liberty to sin, nor would the true believer desire such a licence. He would rather be chastened of the Lord, than be allowed to go on with ease and prosperity in sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-14.htm">1 Kings 3:14</a>.

That&#8212;rather, "For."<p>the Lord appeared&#8212;This appearance was, like the former one at Gibeon, most probably made in a supernatural vision, and on the night immediately following the dedication of the temple (2Ch 7:12). The strain of it corresponds to this view, for it consists of direct answers to his solemn inaugural prayer (1Ki 9:3 is in answer to 1Ki 8:29; 1Ki 9:4, 5 is in answer to 1Ki 8:25, 26; 1Ki 9:6-9 to 1Ki 8:33-46; see also De 29:22-24).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then; </span> upon that condition; for my promise to David was conditional. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever,....

"The district of Hamath," i.e., Epiphania on the Orontes, is mentioned as the northern boundary (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>, etc.); and "the brook of Egypt" (&#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;), Rhinocorura, as the southern boundary (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-4.htm">Joshua 15:4</a>). "The feast" (&#1492;&#1495;&#1490;), which Solomon held with the people "seven days and seven days, fourteen days," is not the feast of the dedication, but, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-2.htm">1 Kings 8:2</a>, the feast of tabernacles, which fell in the seventh month; and the meaning of the verse is, that on that occasion the feast of the seventh month was kept for fourteen days, namely, seven days as the feast of the dedication, and seven days as the feast of tabernacles. We are obliged to take the words in this way, partly on account of the evident reference to &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1490; (at the feast) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-2.htm">1 Kings 8:2</a> in the expression &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1495;&#1490; (the feast) in this verse, and partly on account of the statement which follows in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-66.htm">1 Kings 8:66</a>, "and on the eighth day he sent the people away." The "eight day" is not the first day of the feast of tabernacles (Thenius); but the eighth day, as the conclusion of the feast of tabernacles, &#1506;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a>). The correctness of this view is placed beyond all doubt by the context in the Chronicles, which states more clearly that, "Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him ... and they kept &#1506;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514; (the closing feast) on the eight day; for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days; and on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away." The feast of tabernacles lasted seven days, from the 15th to the 21st, with a closing festival on the eighth day, i.e., the 22nd of the month (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-33.htm">Leviticus 23:33-39</a>). This festival was preceded by the dedication of the temple from the 8th to the 14th of the month. The statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-66.htm">1 Kings 8:66</a>, "on the eighth day he sent the people away," if we take the words in their strict sense, is at variance with the statement in the Chronicles, "on the 23rd day," since the eighth day of the feast of tabernacles was the 22nd day of the month; but it may easily be accounted for from want of precision in a well-known matter. Solomon sent the people away on the eighth day, i.e., on the afternoon or evening of the atzereth of the feast of tabernacles, so that on the morning of the next day, i.e., on the 23rd of the month, the people took their journey home, "joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the Lord had shown to His servant David and to the people." David is mentioned, because the completion of the building of the temple was the fulfilment of the divine promise given to him. "Tents," for houses, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-1.htm">2 Samuel 10:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/7-8.htm">Judges 7:8</a>, and other passages. </body></html>
