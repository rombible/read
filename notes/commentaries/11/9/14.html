(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-14.htm" title="Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred three score and six talents of gold,">1Kings 10:14</a>.) How it is connected with the previous verses is matter of conjecture. It may possibly be a note referring back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-11.htm" title="(Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.">1Kings 9:11</a>, and explaining the amount of gold which Hiram had sent. If this is not so, it would then seem to be a payment in acknowledgment of the cession of the cities, as being of greater value than the debt which it was meant to discharge. Hiram’s depreciation of the cities need not imply that he did not care to keep them. “It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-14.htm" title="It is naught, it is naught, said the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasts.">Proverbs 20:14</a>). Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant. viii.</span> 5, 3), has a quaint story in connection with this intercourse between Hiram and Solomon (quoted from Dios), declaring that a contest in riddles took place between these kings, and that, when Hiram could not solve the riddles of Solomon, he “paid a large sum of money for his fine,” but adds that he afterwards retaliated on Solomon, by aid of Abdemon of Tyre. It appears by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-2.htm" title="And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD's house.">2Chronicles 7:2</a>, that the cities were afterwards restored to Israel—how, and why, we know not.<p>(15 28) The rest of the chapter consists of brief historical notes, partly referring back to the previous records. Thus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm" title="And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.">1Kings 9:15</a> refers back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-13.htm" title="And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.">1Kings 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/9-20.htm" title="And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,">1Kings 9:20-22</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-15.htm" title="And Solomon had three score and ten thousand that bore burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;">1Kings 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-24.htm" title="But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.">1Kings 9:24</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-8.htm" title="And his house where he dwelled had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like to this porch.">1Kings 7:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-25.htm" title="And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he built to the LORD, and he burnt incense on the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house.">1Kings 9:25</a> is a note connected with the history of the dedication of the Temple. The style is markedly different from the graphic and picturesque style of the passages preceding and following it.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:10-14 Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities. Hiram did not like them. If Solomon would gratify him, let it be in his own element, by becoming his partner in trade, as he did.

The sum sent was very large - above a million and a quarter of our money, according to one estimate of the weight of the Hebrew gold talent; or about 720,000 according to the estimate adopted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/38-24.htm">Exodus 38:24-29</a> note.

Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee&#8212;According to Josephus, they were situated on the northwest of it, adjacent to Tyre. Though lying within the boundaries of the promised land (Ge 15:18; Jos 1:4), they had never been conquered till then, and were inhabited by Canaanite heathens (Jud 4:2-13; 2Ki 15:29). They were probably given to Hiram, whose dominions were small, as a remuneration for his important services in furnishing workmen, materials, and an immense quantity of wrought gold (1Ki 9:14) for the temple and other buildings [Michaelis]. The gold, however, as others think, may have been the amount of forfeits paid to Solomon by Hiram for not being able to answer the riddles and apothegms, with which, according to Josephus, in their private correspondence, the two sovereigns amused themselves. Hiram having refused these cities, probably on account of their inland situation making them unsuitable to his maritime and commercial people, Solomon satisfied his ally in some other way; and, taking these cities into his own hands, he first repaired their shattered walls, then filled them with a colony of Hebrews (2Ch 8:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Or rather, <span class="ital">for Hiram had sent</span>.

This fact is mentioned to explain the gift of the cities, viz., that they were in payment for the gold he had furnished. The timber and stone and labour had been paid for in corn and wine and oil See on 1 Kings 5:11] <span class="cmt_word">to the king sixscore talents of gold</span>. [This sum is variously estimated at from half a million to a million and a quarter of our money. (Keil, <span class="accented">in loc</span>., and Dict. Bib. 3:1734. It equalled 3000 shekels of the sanctuary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-24.htm">Exodus 38:24-26</a>). Keil, who, as we have seen, interprets Cabul to mean <span class="accented">pledged</span>, says somewhat positively that these 120 talents were merely lent to Solomon to enable him to prosecute his undertakings, and that the twenty cities were Hiram's security for its repayment. He further sees in the restoration of these cities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-2.htm">2 Chronicles 8:2</a>, where see note) a proof that Solomon must have repaid the amount lent him. The "sixscore talents "should be compared with the 120 talents of ch. 10:10, and the 666 talents of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14</a>.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-4.htm">1 Kings 9:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-5.htm">1 Kings 9:5</a> contain the special answer to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-25.htm">1 Kings 8:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-26.htm">1 Kings 8:26</a>. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-6.htm">1 Kings 9:6-9</a> refer to the prayer for the turning away of the curse, to which the Lord replies: If ye and your children turn away from me, and do not keep my commandments, but worship other gods, this house will not protect you from the curses threatened in the law, but they will be fulfilled in all their terrible force upon you and upon this temple. This threat follows the Pentateuch exactly in the words in which it is expressed; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-7.htm">1 Kings 9:7</a> being founded upon <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-45.htm">Deuteronomy 28:45</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63</a>, and the curse pronounced upon Israel in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23-26</a> being transferred to the temple in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-8.htm">1 Kings 9:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-9.htm">1 Kings 9:9</a>. -  &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;, to dismiss, i.e., to reject from before my face. "This house will be &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;," i.e., will stand high, or through its rejection will be a lofty example for all that pass by. The temple stood upon a high mountain, so that its ruins could not fail to attract the attention of all who went past. The expression &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; is selected with an implied allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-19.htm">Deuteronomy 26:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1</a>.

The temple, which was high and widely renowned, shall continue to be high, but in the opposite sense, as an example of the rejection of Israel from the presence of God.<p>(Note: The conjecture of Bttcher, Thenius, and Bertheau, that &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; should be altered into &#1506;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, has no support in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-18.htm">Jeremiah 26:18</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/79-1.htm">Psalm 79:1</a>, and has all the ancient versions against it; for they all contain the Masoretic text, either in a verbal translation (lxx), or in a paraphrase, as for example the Chaldee, "the house that was high shall be destroyed;" the Syriac and Arabic, "this house will be destroyed;" and the Vulgate, domus haec erit in exemplum. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-21.htm">2 Chronicles 7:21</a> the thought is somewhat varied by the alteration of &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; into &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;. For it would never enter the mind of any sober critic to attribute this variation to a misinterpretation of our text. Still less can it be an unsuccessful attempt to explain or rectify our text, as Bttcher imagines, since the assertion of this critic, that &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; is only used to signify an exalted position, and never the exaltation of dignity or worth, is proved to be erroneous by <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-19.htm">Deuteronomy 26:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1</a>.) </body></html>
