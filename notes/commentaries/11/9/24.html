He began at the right end, for he built God's house first, and finished that before he began his own; then God blessed him, and he prospered in all his other buildings. Let piety begin, and profit follow; leave pleasure to the last. Whatever pains we take for the glory of God, and to profit others, we are likely to have the advantage. Canaan, the holy land, the glory of all lands, had no gold in it; which shows that the best produce is that which is for the present support of life, our own and others; such things did Canaan produce. Solomon got much by his merchandise, and yet has directed us to a better trade, within reach of the poorest. Wisdom is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold, Pr 3:14.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the marginal reference. Solomon was not satisfied that Pharaoh's daughter should remain in the palace of David, which was on Mount Zion, in the immediate vicinity of the temple, because he regarded the whole vicinity of the temple as made holy by the presence of the ark of God. His own palace was on the other (western) hill, probably directly opposite to the temple, the valley of the Tyropoeum running between them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ki 9:24-28.

This and ver. 25 are not interposed arbitrarily, as might at first sight appear, but refer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1-4</a>. The completion of the palaces rendered it no longer necessary or proper that Solomon's daughter should dwell in a separate house. The chronicler tells us that she had dwelt in David's palace on Mount Zion, and that Solomon was constrained to remove her, because he looked upon all the precinct as now consecrated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-11.htm">2 Chronicles 8:11</a>) ]. <span class="cmt_word">Pharaoh's daughter came up</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. Keil hence argues that the palace stood on higher ground than David's house. But this conclusion is somewhat precarious. The approach to the palace involved an ascent, but Zion was certainly as high as Ophel] <span class="cmt_word">out of the city</span> <span class="cmt_word">of David unto her house which Solomon</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">he</span>] <span class="cmt_word">had built for her: then did he build Millo.</span> [Thenius infers from these words that Mille was a fort or castle for the protection of the harem. But there is no warrant for any such conjecture. In the first place, this wife would seem to have been lodged in her own palace apart from the other wives. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> We can offer a better explanation of the word Mille (see ver. 15). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The word "then" may mean either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1),</span> that when her palace was completed, Solomon then had workmen who were liberated and were employed on Mille (Keil), or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2),</span> that when she vacated David's house, the building of Mille could be proceeded with. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Solomon also built, i.e., fortified, Baalath and Tadmor in the desert. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/19-44.htm">Joshua 19:44</a>, Baalath was a city of Dan, and therefore, as Josephus (Ant. viii. 6, 1) justly observes, was not far from Gezer; and consequently is not to be identified with either Baalgad or Baalbek in Coele-syria (Iken, ich. Rosenm.; cf. Robinson, Bibl. Res. p. 519). &#1514;&#1502;&#1512; (Chethb) is either to be read &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;, or according to Ewald (Gesch. iii. p. 344) &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;, palm, a palm-city. The Keri requires &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1502;&#1512; (Tadmor, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>), a pronunciation which may possibly have simply arisen from Aramaean expansion, but which is still the name for the city current among the Arabs even in the present day (Arabic tadmur, locus palmarum ferax). The Greeks and Romans called it Palmyra. It was situated in what is certainly now a very desolate oasis of the Syrian desert, on the caravan road between Damascus and the Euphrates, - according to modern accounts, not more than seventeen hours' journey from that river; and there are still magnificent ruins which attest the former glory of this wealthy and, under queen Zenobia, very powerful city (cf. Ritter, Erdk. xvii. 2, p. 1486ff., and E. Osiander in Herzog's Cycl.). The correctness of this explanation of the name is placed beyond all doubt by the words "in the wilderness;" and consequently even Movers has given up his former opinion, viz., that it was the city of Thamar in southern Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-19.htm">Ezekiel 47:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-28.htm">Ezekiel 48:28</a>), which Thenius has since adopted, and has decided in favour of Palmyra, without being led astray by the attempt of Hitzig to explain the name from the Sanscrit (vid., Deutsche morgld. Ztschr. viii. p. 222ff.). The expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; appears superfluous, as all the cities named before were situated in the land or kingdom of Solomon, and Tadmor is sufficiently defined by &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; (in the desert). The text is evidently faulty, and either the name of the land, namely Hamath (according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>), has dropped out, or &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is to be taken in connection with what follows (according to the Cod. Al. of the lxx), and the cop. &#1493; before &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497; &#1488;&#1514; must be erased and inserted before &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; ("and in the land of all the magazine-cities").</body></html>
