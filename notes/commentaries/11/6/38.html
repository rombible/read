Christ is the true Temple. In him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead; in him meet all God's spiritual Israel; through him we have access with confidence to God. 2. Every believer is a living temple, in whom the Spirit of God dwells, 1Co 3:16. This living temple is built upon Christ as its Foundation, and will be perfect in due time. 3. The gospel church is the mystical temple. It grows to a holy temple in the Lord, enriched and beautified with the gifts and graces of the Spirit. This temple is built firm, upon a Rock. 4. Heaven is the everlasting temple. There the church will be fixed. All that shall be stones in that building, must, in the present state of preparation, be fitted and made ready for it. Let sinners come to Jesus as the living Foundation, that they may be built on him, a part of this spiritual house, consecrated in body and soul to the glory of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Seven years - More exactly, "seven years and six months," since Zif was the second, and Bul the eighth month. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ki 6:37, 38.

In the fourth year was the foundation laid&#8212;The building was begun in the second month of the fourth year and completed in the eighth month of the eleventh year of Solomon's reign, comprising a period of seven and a half years, which is reckoned here in round numbers. It was not a very large, but a very splendid building, requiring great care, and ingenuity, and division of labor. The immense number of workmen employed, together with the previous preparation of the materials, serves to account for the short time occupied in the process of building.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Seven years complete, </span> and six months, as appears by computation.

The great curiosity of art which was used here, and the fewness of exquisite artists, required the longer time for the doing of it.

It was between the new moon of November and December, and this being the eighth month, while Zif was the second, it is seen that the exact time occupied by the building of the Temple was seven years and a half. Probably the preparation of wood and stone in Lebanon is not included in this time, but was made during the four years of Solomon’s reign which preceded the building.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span>  =  rain.

The commentators all cite Pliny's statement that all Asia was building the temple of Diana at Ephesus 200 years, but the cases are not at all parallel. We learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-2.htm">2 Chronicles 3:2</a>, that it was on the <span class="accented">second</span> day of the month that the building was commenced. Bishop Wordsworth, who assigns seven years and <span class="accented">seven</span> months as the time occupied in this work, sees in this hebdomatie period an analogy to the seven days of the creation.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And two doors (i.e., folding doors, sc. he made; &#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is also governed by &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-31.htm">1 Kings 6:31</a>) of olive wood, and carved upon them carved work," etc., as upon the walls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a>), "and overlaid them with gold, spreading the gold upon the cherubs and palms" (&#1497;&#1512;&#1491;, hiphil of &#1512;&#1491;&#1491;), i.e., he spread gold-leaf upon them, so that, as Rashi observes, all the figures, the elevations and depressions of the carved work, were impressed upon the coating of gold-leaf, and were thus plainly seen. Thenius infers from this explanatory clause, that the gilding upon the walls and doors was most probably confined to the figures engraved, and did not extend over the whole of the walls and doors, because, if the doors had been entirely overlaid with gold, the gilding of the carved work upon them would have followed as a matter of course. But this inference is a very doubtful one. For if it followed as a matter of course from the gilding of the entire doors that the carved work upon them was overlaid with gold, it would by no means follow that the overlaying was such as to leave the carved work visible or prominent, which this clause affirms. Moreover, a partial gilding of the walls would not coincide with the expression &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-22.htm">1 Kings 6:22</a>, since these words, which are used with emphasis, evidently affirm more than "that such (partial) gilding was carried out everywhere throughout the temple proper." The doors in front of the Most Holy Place did not render the curtain mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-14.htm">2 Chronicles 3:14</a> unnecessary, as many suppose. This curtain may very well have been suspended within the doors; so that even when the doors were opened outwards on the entrance of the high priest, the curtain formed a second covering, which prevented the priests who were ministering in the Holy Place and court from looking in.<p>(Note: H. Merz (Herzog's Cycl.) now admits this, whereas he formerly agreed with Ewald and others in denying the existence of the curtain in Solomon's temple, and regarded the curtain (veil) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51-52</a> as an arbitrary addition made by Herod out of his princely caprice, thus overlooking the deep symbolical meaning which the veil or curtain possessed.)</body></html>
