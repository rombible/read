Christ is the true Temple. In him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead; in him meet all God's spiritual Israel; through him we have access with confidence to God. 2. Every believer is a living temple, in whom the Spirit of God dwells, 1Co 3:16. This living temple is built upon Christ as its Foundation, and will be perfect in due time. 3. The gospel church is the mystical temple. It grows to a holy temple in the Lord, enriched and beautified with the gifts and graces of the Spirit. This temple is built firm, upon a Rock. 4. Heaven is the everlasting temple. There the church will be fixed. All that shall be stones in that building, must, in the present state of preparation, be fitted and made ready for it. Let sinners come to Jesus as the living Foundation, that they may be built on him, a part of this spiritual house, consecrated in body and soul to the glory of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Knops and open flowers - Rather, "gourds and opening flower-buds."

I will set up my word, which I spake to thy father David." The reference is to the promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12</a>. of the everlasting establishment of this throne. God would fulfil this for Solomon if he would walk in the commandments of the Lord, as his father had already urged upon him when he handed over the kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-3.htm">1 Kings 2:3</a>). The promise in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-13.htm">1 Kings 6:13</a>, "I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel," does not contain a second promise added to the one given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12</a>., but simply a special application of it to the building of the temple which had already been commenced. The eternal establishment of the throne of David involved the dwelling of God among His people, or rather is founded upon it. This dwelling of God is now to receive a new and lasting realization. The temple is to be a pledge that the Lord will maintain for His people His covenant of grace and His gracious presence. In this respect the promised, "I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, and not forsake my people Israel," is a confirmation of the word which Jehovah had spoken to David, although, so far as the actual words are concerned, it is more closely connected with <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-11.htm">Leviticus 26:11</a>, when the highest blessing attendant upon the faithful observance of the commandments of God is summed up in the promise, "I will make my abode among you, and my soul will not despise you." </body></html>
