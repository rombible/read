Christ is the true Temple. In him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead; in him meet all God's spiritual Israel; through him we have access with confidence to God. 2. Every believer is a living temple, in whom the Spirit of God dwells, 1Co 3:16. This living temple is built upon Christ as its Foundation, and will be perfect in due time. 3. The gospel church is the mystical temple. It grows to a holy temple in the Lord, enriched and beautified with the gifts and graces of the Spirit. This temple is built firm, upon a Rock. 4. Heaven is the everlasting temple. There the church will be fixed. All that shall be stones in that building, must, in the present state of preparation, be fitted and made ready for it. Let sinners come to Jesus as the living Foundation, that they may be built on him, a part of this spiritual house, consecrated in body and soul to the glory of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Two cherubims - The pattern of the tabernacle was followed (marginal reference), but without servile imitation. The original cherubs were entirely of gold. These, being so much larger, were of wood, merely overlaid with a golden plating. The arrangement of the wings, and the direction of the faces, seem also to have been different. Moses' cherubim "covered with their wings over the mercy seat;" Solomon's stretched out theirs to the full <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-27.htm">1 Kings 6:27</a>, so that the four wings, each five cubits long <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-24.htm">1 Kings 6:24</a>, extended across the whole sanctuary, the width of which was twenty cubits <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a>. The former looked toward one another, and were bent downward toward the mercy-seat; the latter looked outward, toward the great chamber.

The cedar-wood was beautifully embellished with figures in relievo, representing clusters of foliage, open flowers, cherubims, and palm trees.

"Solomon overlaid the house from within with fine gold." &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; cannot be the party wall between the Holy Place and the Most Holy, as I formerly supposed, but is the Holy Place as distinguished from the Most Holy. The following words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; are very obscure. If we rendered them, "he caused to pass over in (with) golden chains before the hinder room," we could only think of an ornament consisting of golden chains, which ran along the wall in front of the hinder room and above the folding doors. But this would be very singularly expressed. We must therefore take &#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, as Gesenius, de Wette, and many of the earlier commentators do, according to the Chaldaean usage in the sense of bolting or fastening: "he bolted (fastened) with golden chains before the hinder room;" and must assume with Merz and others that the doors into the Most Holy Place (except on the day of atonement) were closed and fastened with golden chains, which were stretched across the whole breadth of the door and stood out against the wall.<p>(Note: The conjecture of Thenius, that &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1514; (the curtain) has dropped out of the text and should be restored ("he carried the curtain across with golden chains"), is very properly described by Merz as "certainly untenable," since, apart from the fact that not one of the older versions contains the missing words, chains would have impeded the moving of the curtain. It is true that, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-14.htm">2 Chronicles 3:14</a>, there was a curtain before the Most Holy Place; but as it is not mentioned so early as this even in the Chronicles, this would not be its proper position in the account before us, but it would be most suitably mentioned either in connection with or after the reference to the doors of the Most Holy Place in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-31.htm">1 Kings 6:31</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-32.htm">1 Kings 6:32</a>.)<p> - The following expression, &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; &#1493;&#1497;&#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, "and he overlaid it with gold," can only refer to the altar mentioned in the previous verse, the gilding of which has not yet been noticed, however surprising the separation of these words from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a> may be. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-22.htm">1 Kings 6:22</a> what has already been stated with regard to the gilding is repeated once more in a comprehensive manner, which brings this subject to a close. The whole house (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;) is the Holy Place and the Most Holy, but not the porch or hall, as this is expressly distinguished from the house. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;, the whole altar, not merely a portion of it.</body></html>
