God's Promises unto It.<p>11-13. the word of the Lord came to Solomon&#8212;probably by a prophet. It was very seasonable, being designed: first, to encourage him to go on with the building, by confirming anew the promise made to his father David (2Sa 7:12-16); and secondly, to warn him against the pride and presumption of supposing that after the erection of so magnificent a temple, he and his people would always be sure of the presence and favor of God. The condition on which that blessing could alone be expected was expressly stated. The dwelling of God among the children of Israel refers to those symbols of His presence in the temple, which were the visible tokens of His spiritual relation to that people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> God speaks thus, partly to encourage him to proceed in his work, and partly to purge out that pride and vain-glory, (which God, the searcher of hearts, saw either then did or would arise in Solomon’s mind, as being the author and builder of so glorious a work,) and that presumption and security, which was very likely to grow, and God foresaw would grow, both in Solomon and in the people; as if God was now in a manner engaged to continue his presence with them, and in his own temple; and that they had now no great reason to fear God’s departure from them, though they should provoke him. Therefore he expresseth the condition upon which his promise and favour is suspended; and by assuring him thereof in case of obedience, he plainly intimates the contrary upon his disobedience. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Concerning this house which thou art in building,....

The meaning is that rebates were attached against the temple wall, at the point where the lower beams of the different side stories were to be placed, so that the heads of these beams rested upon the rebates and were not inserted in the actual wall of the temple-house. These rebates are called very descriptively &#1502;&#1490;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;, deductions or contractions of the thickness of the wall. We may assume that there were four such rebates: three for the three floors of the side stories, and one for the roof. It still remains doubtful, however, whether these rebates were merely laid along the temple wall, or along the outer wall of the side building as well, so as to ensure symmetry and make each of the two walls half a cubit thinner or weaker at every rebate. The former is the more probable. And accordingly the temple wall was one cubit weaker at each rebate, that is to say, in four places. If, therefore, it still remained two cubits thick at the top, it must have been six cubits thick below. This extraordinary thickness, however, would be quite in keeping with the remains of buildings of great antiquity, the walls of which have generally a colossal thickness, and also with the size of the square stones of which the wall was constructed, as described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-10.htm">1 Kings 7:10</a>.</body></html>
