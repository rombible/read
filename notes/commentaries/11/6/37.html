Indeed, all things considered, it must be acknowledged Solomon made an extraordinary despatch; for, if the building of Diana’s temple at Ephesus employed all Asia for <span class="ital">two hundred years; </span>and no fewer than three hundred and sixty thousand men were occupied for twenty years together in erecting one pyramid, as Pliny affirms, lib. 36, chap. 12, no reasonable man can wonder that this temple was seven years and a half in building. See Calmet, and <span class="ital">Univ. Hist., </span>vol. 4. octavo. Now let us see what this temple typifies:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1. </span>Christ himself is the true temple. He himself spoke of <span class="ital">the temple of his body: </span>and in him <span class="ital">dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead. </span>In him all the Israel of God meet, and through him <span class="ital">have access with confidence to God.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">2. </span>Every believer is a living temple, in whom the Spirit of God dwelleth: we are wonderfully made by the divine providence, but more wonderfully made anew by the divine grace; and as Solomon’s temple was built on a rock, so are we built on Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">3. </span>The church is a mystical temple, enriched and beautified, not with gold and precious stones, but with the gifts and graces of the Spirit. Angels are ministering spirits, attending the church, and all the members of it, on all sides.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">4. </span>Heaven is the everlasting temple; there the church will be fixed, and no longer moveable: the cherubim there always attend upon the throne of glory. In the temple there was no noise of axes or hammers: every thing is quiet and serene in heaven. All that shall be stones in that building, must here be fitted and made ready for it; must be hewed and squared by the divine grace, and so made meet for a place in that temple. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:15-38 See what was typified by this temple. 1. Christ is the true Temple. In him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead; in him meet all God's spiritual Israel; through him we have access with confidence to God. 2. Every believer is a living temple, in whom the Spirit of God dwells, 1Co 3:16. This living temple is built upon Christ as its Foundation, and will be perfect in due time. 3. The gospel church is the mystical temple. It grows to a holy temple in the Lord, enriched and beautified with the gifts and graces of the Spirit. This temple is built firm, upon a Rock. 4. Heaven is the everlasting temple. There the church will be fixed. All that shall be stones in that building, must, in the present state of preparation, be fitted and made ready for it. Let sinners come to Jesus as the living Foundation, that they may be built on him, a part of this spiritual house, consecrated in body and soul to the glory of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The inner court - An outer court is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-9.htm">2 Chronicles 4:9</a>. The inner court is probably identical with the "higher court" of Jeremiah Jer 36:10, being raised above the outer, as were sometimes the inner courts of Assyrian palaces. The court seems to have surrounded the temple. Its dimensions may be reasonably presumed to have been double those of the court of the tabernacle, i. e., 100 cubits on each side of the temple, and 200 cubits at the ends; or, about 720 feet long by 360 broad.<p>With three rows of hewed stone - Either a fence enclosing the court, or the area of the court, which was possibly formed by three layers of hewn stone placed one above the other, and was then boarded on the top with cedar planks. Such a construction would no doubt be elaborate; but if it was desired to elevate the inner court above the outer, this is the way in which it would be likely to have been done. The temple would be placed, like the Assyrian palaces, on an artificial platform; and the platform, being regarded as a part of the sacred building, would be constructed of the best material. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ki 6:37, 38. The time Taken to Build It.<p>37. In the fourth year was the foundation laid&#8212;The building was begun in the second month of the fourth year and completed in the eighth month of the eleventh year of Solomon's reign, comprising a period of seven and a half years, which is reckoned here in round numbers. It was not a very large, but a very splendid building, requiring great care, and ingenuity, and division of labor. The immense number of workmen employed, together with the previous preparation of the materials, serves to account for the short time occupied in the process of building.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the Lord laid,....

Ewald, 284, a., &#x3b2;) of olive wood, which moved, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-50.htm">1 Kings 7:50</a>, on golden hinges. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1492;&#1488;&#1497;&#1500;, "the projection of the door-posts was fifth" (&#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1493;&#1514;( " is construed freely as an explanatory apposition to &#1492;&#1488;&#1497;&#1500;, to which it is really subordinate; cf. Ewald, 290, e.). These obscure words, which have been interpreted in very different ways (see Ges. Thes. pp. 43f.), can hardly have any other meaning than this: the projecting framework of the doors occupied the fifth part of the breadth of the wall. For the explanation given by Bttcher and Thenius, "the entrance framework with posts of fifth strength," has no real support in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-3.htm">Ezekiel 41:3</a>. To justify the rendering given to &#1492;&#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; (fifth strength), &#1492;&#1488;&#1497;&#1500; is supplied, though not in the sense of projection, but in the thoroughly unwarranted sense of strength or thickness of the wall; and in addition to this, a wall two cubits thick is postulated between the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place, in direct contradiction to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-16.htm">1 Kings 6:16</a>. The further evidence, which Thenius finds in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-8.htm">1 Kings 8:8</a>, in support of this explanation, has been already rejected by Bttcher as unsustained. It would indeed be extremely strange for the thickness of the door-posts which formed the setting of the entrance to be given, whereas nothing is said about the size of the doors. According to our explanation, "a fifth of the breadth of the wall," the entrance was four cubits broad including the projecting door-posts, and each of the two wings of the folding doors about a cubit and a half broad, if we reckon the projecting framework on either side at half a cubit in breadth.</body></html>
