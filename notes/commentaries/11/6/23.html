In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/25-18.htm" title="And you shall make two cherubim of gold, of beaten work shall you make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.">Exodus 25:18-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/37-7.htm" title="And he made two cherubim of gold, beaten out of one piece made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat;">Exodus 37:7-9</a>, they are described as having their faces towards the mercy-seat, and covering the mercy-seat with their wings. Here, from the careful description of the outstretched wings, of ten cubits in width for each cherub, meeting in the midst of the house and touching the walls, it would seem that they must have been turned so as to face the entrance. The cherubim over the ark are described only in three places in the Old Testament—in the passages in Exodus, here, and in the parallel <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/3-10.htm" title="And in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work, and overlaid them with gold.">2Chronicles 3:10-13</a>, and in those great visions of the priestly prophet Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/1-4.htm" title="And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the middle thereof as the color of amber, out of the middle of the fire.">Ezekiel 1:4-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/10-1.htm" title="Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubim there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.">Ezekiel 10:1-22</a>) which have determined the imagery of the Apocalypse. In no case is their form distinctly mentioned, unless, by comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/10-14.htm" title="And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.">Ezekiel 10:14-15</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-10.htm" title="As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.">Ezekiel 1:10</a>, it may be inferred to have been the form of a winged bull; whence would be naturally derived the golden calves of the idolatry introduced into Israel in the time of Jeroboam. Josephus, indeed, in his description of the Temple (Antt. viii. c. 3, § 3), expressly says that “no one can tell, or even conjecture, of what shape the cherubim were.” The tradition, therefore, must have been lost in the Second Temple, where there was no ark; and this is the more strange, because in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-1.htm" title="Moreover you shall make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubim of cunning work shall you make them.">Exodus 26:1</a> the cherubim are said to have been represented in the embroidery of the curtains, and here (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-32.htm" title="The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold on the cherubim, and on the palm trees.">1Kings 6:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-35.htm" title="And he carved thereon cherubim and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted on the carved work.">1Kings 6:35</a>) to have been similarly carved on the walls.<p>But, whatever the cherubim were, it is certain that they were in no sense representations or emblems of Deity, like the winged figures of Assyria or Egypt, with which they have been often compared. They appear to symbolise the great physical forces of the universe, as guided by superhuman angelic intelligence to serve the supreme will of God. Thus, when first mentioned in Scripture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-24.htm" title="If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.">Genesis 4:24</a>), the cherubim are associated with “the flaming sword, turning every way, to guard the tree of life”; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-10.htm" title="And he rode on a cherub, and did fly: yes, he did fly on the wings of the wind.">Psalm 18:10</a>, the Lord is said “to ride upon the cherubim,” and “come flying upon the wings of the wind”; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-10.htm" title="As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.">Ezekiel 1:10</a>, the four living creatures, or cherubim, sustain the throne of God, and bear it away upon their wings; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/4-6.htm" title="And before the throne there was a sea of glass like to crystal: and in the middle of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.">Revelation 4:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/5-8.htm" title="And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of saints.">Revelation 5:8-9</a>, the same living creatures unite with the elders representing the Church of redeemed humanity, in worship of the Lord upon His throne. The representation, therefore, of the cherubim in the Temple simply expresses the claim for Jehovah, the God of Israel, of such lordship over all creation as is hymned in the seraphic song of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-3.htm" title="And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.">Isaiah 6:3</a>. Possibly the change of attitude of the cherubim in the Temple denoted a change of idea, characteristic of Solomon and his age. The old attitude is clearly that of worship of God: the new rather of manifestation of His glory to man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-23.htm" title="And within the oracle he made two cherubim of olive tree, each ten cubits high.">1 Kings 6:23</a></span>. <span class="ital">Within the oracle he made two cherubims — </span>These were different from, and much larger than those made by Moses, which were of solid gold, and arose out of each end of the mercy-seat, being of one piece with it, and looking one upon the other, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/25-18.htm" title="And you shall make two cherubim of gold, of beaten work shall you make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat....">Exodus 25:18-19</a>. But these made by Solomon were of olive-wood, or, as it is in the Hebrew, of <span class="ital">tree of oil; </span>many sorts of which wood there were besides olive; as <span class="ital">pine, cedar,</span> &c. The heathen set up images of their gods, and worshipped them. These cherubim were designed to represent the servants and attendants of the God of Israel, the holy angels; not to be worshipped themselves, but to show how great he is whom we worship.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Here it may be proper to note, that the word <span class="greekheb">דביר</span>, <span class="ital">debir, </span>(which our translation constantly renders oracle,) comes from <span class="greekheb">דבר</span>, <span class="ital">dabar, </span>which signifies to speak; because God, who dwelt between the cherubim of the ark in the Mosaic tabernacle, declared his mind from thence, when he was consulted by the high-priest with Urim and Thummim. And it still retained this name, though we never read of any answer by Urim and Thummim in this temple. It is highly probable that, upon their rejecting the government of God, and turning the theocracy into a human government by kings, God ceased to direct and govern them by that divine oracle. During the reign of David, indeed, there are some footsteps of it, their new government by kings being not well established. So that we may suppose there was a mixture of the theocracy still with it, as may be gathered from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-1.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said to him, Go up. And David said, Where shall I go up? And he said, To Hebron.">2 Samuel 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-1.htm" title="Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.">2 Samuel 21:1</a>. But after that there is not the least glimpse of it; but they inquired of God by the prophets, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-3.htm" title="And the king of Israel said to his servants, Know you that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?">1 Kings 22:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-11.htm" title="But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.">2 Kings 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-20.htm" title="And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.">2 Kings 3:20</a>. And, what is very remarkable, in the days of Josiah, when the high-priest was sent by that king to inquire of God, he applied to Huldah the prophetess for that purpose: which is a demonstration that the answer by Urim and Thummim ceased when God’s government was cast off by them; to which that oracle properly appertained. And therefore in all these places it would be more properly rendered, the <span class="ital">most holy place. </span>For though the ark was placed there, no oracles or words of the Lord were given from thence.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:15-38 See what was typified by this temple. 1.

The original cherubs were entirely of gold. These, being so much larger, were of wood, merely overlaid with a golden plating. The arrangement of the wings, and the direction of the faces, seem also to have been different. Moses' cherubim "covered with their wings over the mercy seat;" Solomon's stretched out theirs to the full <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-27.htm">1 Kings 6:27</a>, so that the four wings, each five cubits long <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-24.htm">1 Kings 6:24</a>, extended across the whole sanctuary, the width of which was twenty cubits <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a>.

The wood of the oleaster, which is firm, fine grained, and durable, was used by the Greeks for the images of their gods (Winer). The cherubim of the tabernacle were of solid gold; those of the temple, on account of their great size (fifteen feet high) were necessarily of less costly material. But though of wood, yet the most durable and beautiful of wood, the olive, was employed in their construction.

But there is a doubt as to its derivation and true meaning. Aquila and Symmachus render it &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, Jerome &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, or in the Vulg. oraculum, so that they derive it from &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, to speak; and Hengstenberg adopts this derivation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a> : &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;, lit., that which is spoken, then the place where the speaking takes place. Most of the more recent commentators, on the other hand, follow the example of C. B. Michaelis and J. Simonis, and render it, after the Arabic, the hinder portion or back room, which is favoured by the antithesis &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;, the front sanctuary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-17.htm">1 Kings 6:17</a>). The words of the text, moreover, are not to be understood as referring to a cedar wall in front of the Most Holy Place which rose to the height of twenty cubits, but to all four walls of the Most Holy Place, so that the wall which divided the hinder room from the Holy Place is not expressly mentioned, simply because it is self-evident. The words also imply that the whole of the hinder space of the house to the length of twenty cubits was cut off for the Most Holy Place, and therefore the party wall must also have filled the whole height of the house, which was as much as thirty cubits, and reached, as is expressly stated, from the floor to the roof. There remained therefore forty cubits of the house (in length) for &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;, the front palace, i.e., the Holy Place of the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-17.htm">1 Kings 6:17</a>). &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, anterior, formed from &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; (cf.

"And cedar wood was (placed) against the house inside, sculpture of gourds (colocynthides) and open buds." &#1502;&#1511;&#1500;&#1506;&#1514; is in apposition to &#1488;&#1512;&#1494;, containing a more minute description of the nature of the covering of cedar. &#1502;&#1511;&#1500;&#1506;&#1514; signifies sculpture, half-raised work (basso relievo); not, however, "that kind of bas-relief in which the figures, instead of rising above the surface on which they are wrought, are simply separated from it by the chiselling out of their outlines, and their being then rounded off according to these outlines" (Thenius). For although the expression &#1502;&#1511;&#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a>) appears to favour this, yet "merely engraved work" does not harmonize with the decorations of the brazen stands in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-31.htm">1 Kings 7:31</a>, which are also called &#1502;&#1511;&#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;. &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; are figures resembling the &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;, or wild gourds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-39.htm">2 Kings 4:39</a>), i.e., oval ornaments, probably running in straight rows along the walls. &#1510;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; are open flower-buds; not hangings or garlands of flowers (Thenius), for this meaning cannot be derived from &#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1512; in the sense of loosening or setting free, so as to signify flowers loosened or set free ( equals  garlands), which would be a marvellous expression! The objection that, "flowers not yet opened, i.e., flower-buds, were not &#1510;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, but &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501;," rests upon a false interpretation of the passage referred to.</body></html>
