It may have been suggested by the prohibition (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-25.htm" title="And if you will make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stone: for if you lift up your tool on it, you have polluted it.">Exodus 20:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-5.htm" title="And there shall you build an altar to the LORD your God, an altar of stones: you shall not lift up any iron tool on them.">Deuteronomy 27:5</a>) of the use of tools on the altar of the Lord. But the idea implied in this prohibition was rather different—viz., the use for the altar of stones in their simple, matural condition, without “pollution” by the art of man. It has been chronicled in Heber’s well-known lines:—<p>“No workmen’s steel, no ponderous axes rung;<p>Like some tall palm the noiseless fabric sprung.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/1_kings/6.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>1 Kings<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">BUILDING IN SILENCE<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-7.htm" title="And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.">1 Kings 6:7</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The Temple was built in silence. It ‘rose like an exhalation.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘No hammer fell, no ponderous axes rung, Like some tall palm the mystic fabric sprung.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Perhaps it was merely for convenience of transport and to save time that the stones were dressed in the quarries, but more probably the silence was due to an instinct of reverence. We may fairly use it as suggesting two thoughts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. How God’s house is mostly built in silence. ‘</span>The Kingdom of God cometh not with observation.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {1} In reference to its advance in the world. Destructive work is noisy, constructive work is silent. God was in ‘the still small voice,’ not in the wind or the earthquake or the fire. Christ’s own career, how silent it was! Drums are loud and empty. The spread of the kingdom was unnoticed by the world’s great ones-Caesars, philosophers, patricians, and it silently grew underground. Hence may flow-<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{a} An encouragement to those whose work is inconspicuous.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{b} A lesson not to mistake noise and notoriety for spiritual progress.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{c} Guidance as to our expectations of the advance of Christ’s kingdom. It will transform society by slow, often unnoticed, degrees, by radical change of individuals’ habits. The elevation of humanity will be slow, like the imperceptible rise of the Norwegian coast. Sudden changes are short-lived changes. ‘Lightly come, lightly go.’ What matures slowly will last long.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {2} In reference to its growth in our souls.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Silence is needed for that. There must be much still communion and quiet reflection. The advance in the Christian life is variously likened to a battle, since there are antagonists and struggle is needed to overcome; and to vegetable or corporeal growth, which the mysterious indwelling life works without effort and almost without consciousness, but it is also likened to the erection of a building, in which there is continuity, and each successive course of masonry is the foundation for that above it. That work of building is work that must be done in silence. If we are to grow in the grace and knowledge of Jesus, we must silently drink in the sunshine and dew, and so prosperously pass from blade to ear, and thence to full corn in the ear.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Surely nothing is more needed in these days of noisy advertisement, and measurement of the importance of things by the noise that they can make, than this lesson of the place of silence in Christian progress, both for individuals and for the Christian Church as a whole.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. How God’s house is built of prepared stones.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>That is true, in one view of the matter, in regard to the Church on earth, for there must be the individual act of repentance and faith before a soul is fit to be built into the fabric of the Church.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There is providential training of men for their tasks before these are given to them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But the highest application of the symbol which we venture to find in our text is to the relation between the earthly and the heavenly life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> This world is the quarry where the stones are dressed for the Temple in the heavens.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{<span class="ital">a</span>} Life is the chipping and hewing. The unnecessary pieces are struck off with heavy mallet and sharp chisel. Pain and sorrow are thus explained, if not wholly, yet sufficiently to bring about submission and trust.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{<span class="ital">b</span>} The Builder has His plan clearly before Him, and works accurately to realise it. He perfectly knows what He means to build, and every stroke of the dressing-tool is accurately directed. There are no mistakes made in His quarrying.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{<span class="ital">c</span>} We may be sure that the prepared stones will be brought to the Temple site and built into it. There lie gigantic half-hewn pillars in abandoned quarries in Syria and Egypt. But no one will ever say of the divine Temple-Builder: He began to build and was not able to finish. It remains a problem how the old builders managed to transport these huge stones from the quarries to the site, but we may be sure that the Architect of the ‘house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,’ knows how to bring every stone that has been prepared here, to the place prepared for it, and for which it has been prepared. We may repose on the Apostle’s assurance that ‘He that has begun a good work in you will perform it,’ or rather on the more sure word of Jesus Himself, ‘He that overcometh, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-7.htm" title="And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.">1 Kings 6:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">The house — was built of stone made ready — </span>Hewed and squared, and so fitted for their several uses and places, according to the direction of the architect, that they might be joined together without any other labour than the putting them one by or upon another. <span class="ital">So that there was neither hammer nor axe, </span>&c. — The stones were laid without any noise, there being nothing to be done but to join them together.

The idea of this preparation at a distance, so that there might be as little noise as possible while the building was in progress, was probably derived from the command (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-25.htm" title="And if you will make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stone: for if you lift up your tool on it, you have polluted it.">Exodus 20:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-5.htm" title="And there shall you build an altar to the LORD your God, an altar of stones: you shall not lift up any iron tool on them.">Deuteronomy 27:5</a>) that no iron tool should be used in the erection of the altar.

It was apparently the belief of the ancients that stones of proper shape and size were provided in their bed by God (so Theodoret and Procopius,) It is inconceivable, however, that no dressing or preparation of any kind would be required; an idea, moreover, which is contradicted by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-18.htm">1 Kings 5:18</a>. When Gardiner (in Bahr, American edition) quotes Keil (in his earlier work) as understanding "all unviolated stones of the quarry," he hardly does justice to that author, who straightway adds, "that is, not altogether unhewn stones...  but stones that were so hewn and wrought in the quarry that neither hammer," etc. (see below). Similarly Thehius and Bahr] <span class="cmt_word">before it was brought thither</span> [so the Authorized Version renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;</span> but mistakenly.

The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> is used of quarrying in 1 Kings 5:31 (Heb.) <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>1 Kings 5:17<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span> Where was this quarry? The general idea is that it was in the Lebanon. And it is not to be denied that some of the massive substructions and cornerstones of the temple may have been brought from the mountain, along with the wood; but the bulk of the stone, there can be no doubt, was found much nearer home. Some of it, according to the Mishna (<span class="accented">Middoth</span>, 3:4), came from Bethlehem; but we can hardly be mistaken in believing that for the most part it was quarried in Jerusalem itself, under the very temple rock, and out of the vast caverns recovered some years ago by Dr. Barclay (see his "City of the Great King"), the "Royal Caverns" of Josephus. See "Quart. Journal," Pal. Explor. Fund (No. 7.), pp, 373, 374, and cf. p. 34. There are unmistakable evidences of these extensive caverns having served as a quarry. Not only are the walls cut straight, but rude masses are left here and there to support the roof, and, what is still more convincing, there are stones more or less cut out of the rock, and incisions are made where stones are to be quarried. There was no reason why the workmen should go far afield for stone when they had it, and of very excellent quality, at their own doors]: <span class="cmt_word">so that there was neither hammer</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and hammers.</span> Keil understands "finished stones of the quarry, and hammer, and axe." But the word "was built" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>), coming as <span class="cmt_word">it</span> does between "quarry" and "hammers," almost forbids this connexion] nor axe  [Heb. <span class="accented">the axe</span>] <span class="cmt_word">nor any tool</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">every tool</span>] <span class="cmt_word">of iron heard in the house, while it was building.</span> [The historian remarks on this, not only because it was so unusual, but with the evident idea that it was a fulfilment of the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-5.htm">Deuteronomy 27:5, 6</a>), which required the <span class="accented">altar</span> to be of virgin stones, untouched by tool of iron. If the quarries are to be identified with the "Royal Caverns," it is easy to understand how the temple rose up in silence. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Outside of the Building. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a>. The building of the temple, a fixed and splendid house of Jehovah as the dwelling-place of His name in the midst of His people, formed an important epoch so far as the Old Testament kingdom of God was concerned, inasmuch as, according to the declaration of God made through the prophet Nathan, an end would thereby be put to the provisional condition of the people of Israel in the land of Canaan, since the temple was to become a substantial pledge of the permanent possession of the inheritance promised by the Lord. The importance of this epoch is indicated by the fact, that the time when the temple was built is defined not merely in relation to the year of Solomon's reign, but also in relation to the exodus of the Israelites out of Egypt. "In the 480th year after the exodus of the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign, in the second month of the year, Solomon built the house of the Lord." The correctness of the number 480, as contrasted with the 440th year of the lxx and the different statements made by Josephus, is now pretty generally admitted; and we have already proved at <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7</a> that it agrees with the duration of the period of the Judges when rightly estimated.<p>(Note: In opposition to the hypothesis of Bttcher, which has been repeated by Bertheau, viz., that the number 480 merely rests upon the computation of 12 x 40 years, or twelve generations of forty years each, Thenius himself has observed with perfect justice, that "where both the year and the month of the reign of the king in question are given, the principal number will certainly rest upon something more than mere computation; and if this had not been the case, the person making such a computation, if only for the purpose of obtaining the appearance of an exact statement, would have made a particular calculation of the years of Solomon's reign, and would have added them to the round number obtained, and written 'in the year 484.' Moreover, the introduction to our chapter has something annalistic in its tone; and at this early period it would be undoubtedly well known, and in a case like the present a careful calculation would be made, how long a time had elapsed since the most memorable period of the Israelitish nation had passed by." Compare with this Ed. Preuss (Die Zeitrechnung der lxx, p. 74ff.), who has endeavoured with much greater probability to show that the alteration made by the lxx into 440 rests upon nothing more than a genealogical combination.)<p>The name of the month Ziv, brilliancy, splendour, probably so called from the splendour of the flowers, is explained by the clause, "that is, the second month," because the months had no fixed names before the captivity, and received different names after the captivity. The second month was called Jyar after the captivity. - The place where the temple was built is not given in our account, as having been sufficiently well known; though it is given in the parallel text, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-1.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>, namely, "Mount Moriah, where the Lord had appeared to David" at the time of the pestilence, and where David had built an altar of burnt-offering by divine command (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-25.htm">2 Samuel 24:25</a>).</body></html>
