If our version (as is probable) is correct, the outside measure of the lintel and post was a fifth part of the wall, that is, four cubits, or six feet. Each door, therefore, would be something less than six feet by three. The description of the gilding states with minute accuracy that in overlaying the whole of these doors with gold, gold was “spread,” that is, made to cover the carvings in relief (the cherubim of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-35.htm" title="And he carved thereon cherubim and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted on the carved work.">1Kings 6:35</a>); in the other doors the gold was fitted, probably beaten into shape, over the carved work.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-31.htm" title="And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.">1 Kings 6:31</a></span>. <span class="ital">The lintel and side-posts were a fifth part of the wall — </span>The original text here is very obscure, there being nothing in it for the words, <span class="ital">of the wall; </span>but only, <span class="ital">The lintel and side-posts were a fifth, </span>which may be understood to signify, that they held the proportion of a fifth part of the doors. But some think the meaning is, that this gate was the fifth in number belonging to the house. The first, they say, was that which led into the court of the people; the second, that which led into the court of the priests; the third was the door of the porch; the fourth, that of the holy place; and this fifth, of the oracle, or most holy. And in this way they interpret a similar expression, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-33.htm" title="So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.">1 Kings 6:33</a>,) which we render <span class="ital">a fourth part of the wall, </span>the words, <span class="ital">of the wall, </span>being not in the Hebrew, they understand it of the <span class="ital">fourth gate; </span>namely, that of the holy place. But the most probable meaning is, as our translators have understood it to be, that the doors, including the <span class="ital">lintel </span>and <span class="ital">side-posts, </span>here mentioned, as well as the valves, took up a fifth part of the wall or partition, being four cubits in breadth.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:15-38 See what was typified by this temple. 1. Christ is the true Temple. In him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead; in him meet all God's spiritual Israel; through him we have access with confidence to God. 2. Every believer is a living temple, in whom the Spirit of God dwells, 1Co 3:16. This living temple is built upon Christ as its Foundation, and will be perfect in due time. 3. The gospel church is the mystical temple. It grows to a holy temple in the Lord, enriched and beautified with the gifts and graces of the Spirit. This temple is built firm, upon a Rock. 4. Heaven is the everlasting temple. There the church will be fixed. All that shall be stones in that building, must, in the present state of preparation, be fitted and made ready for it. Let sinners come to Jesus as the living Foundation, that they may be built on him, a part of this spiritual house, consecrated in body and soul to the glory of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A fifth part - Better than the margin.

Gesen. himself interprets as A.V.: <span class="accented">crepido cum postibus erat quinta pars, i.e., quintam parietis partem occupabat.</span> The Rabbins: the "entablature with side posts and threshold formed a pentagon." But a pentagonal doorway is without example in Eastern architecture. Thenius: "the strength (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span> is generally taken as an architectural term   =   <span class="accented">crepido portae</span>, or entablature) of the posts was a fifth." Rawlinson: "the lintel was one-fifth of wall, and each door post one-fifth of its height;" in which case the doorway would of course be a square of four cubits. But perhaps the rendering of A.V. (with which Keil and Bahr also agree) is more natural. The meaning, consequently, would be that the entrance to the oracle, inclusive of the side posts which helped to form it, occupied one-fifth of the extent of the cedar partition. The entrance to the <span class="accented">house</span> (ver. 33) was one-fourth of the wall of the house.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The large cherub-figures in the Most Holy Place. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-23.htm">1 Kings 6:23</a>. He made (caused to be made) in the hinder room two cherubs of olive wood, i.e., wood of the oleaster or wild olive-tree, which is very firm and durable, and, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-10.htm">2 Chronicles 3:10</a>, &#1510;&#1506;&#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, i.e., according to the Vulgate, opus statuarium, a peculiar kind of sculpture, which cannot be more precisely defined, as the meaning of &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; is uncertain. "Ten cubits was the height of it" (i.e., of the one and of the other). The figures had a human form, like the golden cherubs upon the ark of the covenant, and stood upright upon their feet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-13.htm">2 Chronicles 3:13</a>), with extended wings of five cubits in length, so that one wing of the one reached to one wing of the other in the centre of the room, and the other wing of each reached to the opposite wall, and consequently the four extended wings filled the entire breadth of the Most Holy Place ( a breadth of twenty cubits), and the two cherubs stood opposite to one another and ten cubits apart. The wings were evidently fastened to the back and placed close to one another upon the shoulder-blades, so that the small space between their starting-points is not taken into consideration in the calculation of their length. The figures were completely overlaid with gold. The ark of the covenant was placed between these cherubs, and under the wings which pointed towards one another. As they were made like those upon the ark, they had evidently the same meaning, and simply served to strengthen the idea which was symbolized in the cherub, and which we have expounded in the Commentary on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>. Only their faces were not turned towards one another and bent down towards the ark, as in the case of the golden cherubim of the ark; but, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-13.htm">2 Chronicles 3:13</a>, they were turned &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, towards the house, i.e., the Holy Place, so as to allow of the extension of the wings along the full length of the Most Holy Place.</body></html>
