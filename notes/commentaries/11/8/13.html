The dark dispensations of Providence should quicken us in fleeing for refuge to the hope of the gospel. Nothing can more reconcile us to them, than to consider what God has said, and to compare his word and works together. Whatever good we do, we must look on it as the performance of God's promise to us, not of our promises to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rather, "The Lord spake of dwelling in the thick darkness" (margin reference).

Turning himself from the priests and people, he quieted with a few words, he addressed the Lord; having built an house for him, for his worship and glory, with this view, that he might dwell in it, he was now, by the above token, fully assured it would be an habitation for him: <p>a settled place for thee to abide in for ever; which is observed in distinction from the tabernacle of Moses, which was often removed from place to place, otherwise this did not continue for ever; though Solomon might hope it would, at least unto the times of the Messiah; and indeed such a building on this spot, for such use, did continue so long, excepting the interval of the seventy years' captivity in Babylon. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> ever.</span><p>(f) He spoke according to the tenor of God's promise which was on the condition that they served him correctly.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_kings/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">I have surely built thee a house to dwell in</span>] R.V. ‘<span class="bld">a house of habitation</span>,’ which is more literal, but not a more elegant rendering. The king sees that God has deigned to accept the house that has been built, and his desire that God may always dwell there fashions the language which he uses. It is to be noted that in this dedication the priests play but a secondary part. Zadok is not once named. Solomon presides, speaks, prays. The LXX. (<span class="ital">Vat.</span>) omits these two verses altogether, but gives a modification and enlargement of them at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-53.htm" title="For you did separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be your inheritance, as you spoke by the hand of Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, O LORD God.">1 Kings 8:53</a> below. See note there. Josephus describes the opening of Solomon’s address to God as ‘words which the king considered fit to be addressed to the divine Being, and which it was right for him to speak.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have surely built</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">to build, I have built</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>thee a house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in forever.</span> [The temple was primarily, as already remarked, a shrine for the ark, between the cherubim of the mercy seat of which God dwelt.

The latter statement is explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-7.htm">1 Kings 8:7</a>. "For the cherubim were spreading out wings towards the place of the ark, and so covered (lit., threw a shade) over the ark and over its poles from above." If the outspread wings of the great cherubic figures threw a shade not only over the ark of the covenant, but also over its poles, the ark was probably so placed that the poles ran from north to south, and not from east to west, as they are sketched in my Archologie.</body></html>
