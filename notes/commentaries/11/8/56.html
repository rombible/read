Of the “rest” of Israel, the transfer of the Ark of the Lord from the shifting Tabernacle to the fixed Temple was at once a sign and a pledge. Yet Solomon’s subsequent words imply that “entering into that rest” was conditional on fulfilment of Israel’s part in the covenant, by “walking in the ways of the Lord.” That condition, which he knew so well, he himself broke, and all Israel with him. Hence the fulfilment of the foreboding which emerges so constantly in his prayer. The glory of rest and happiness of his age was but a gleam of prosperity, soon to be swallowed up in dissension and disaster.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:54-61 Never was a congregation dismissed with what was more likely to affect them, and to abide with them. What Solomon asks for in this prayer, is still granted in the intercession of Christ, of which his supplication was a type. We shall receive grace sufficient, suitable, and seasonable, in every time of need. No human heart is of itself willing to obey the gospel call to repentance, faith, and newness of life, walking in all the commandments of the Lord, yet Solomon exhorts the people to be perfect. This is the scriptural method, it is our duty to obey the command of the law and the call of the gospel, seeing we have broken the law. When our hearts are inclined thereto, feeling our sinfulness and weakness, we pray for Divine assistance; thus are we made able to serve God through Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If the prayer of Solomon be, as it has all the appearance of being, a genuine document of the time, preserved in the archives to which the authors of both Kings and Chronicles had access, all theories of the late origin of Deuteronomy must be regarded as baseless. While references are not infrequent to other portions of the Pentateuch, the language of the prayer is mainly modelled upon Deuteronomy, the promises and threats contained in which are continually before the mind of the writer.

His Prayer.<p>22. Solomon stood before the altar&#8212;This position was in the court of the people, on a brazen scaffold erected for the occasion (2Ch 6:13), fronting the altar of burnt offering, and surrounded by a mighty concourse of people. Assuming the attitude of a suppliant, kneeling (1Ki 8:54; compare 2Ch 6:24) and with uplifted hands, he performed the solemn act of consecration&#8212;an act remarkable, among other circumstances, for this, that it was done, not by the high priest or any member of the Aaronic family, but by the king in person, who might minister about, though not in, holy things. This sublime prayer [1Ki 8:22-35], which breathes sentiments of the loftiest piety blended with the deepest humility, naturally bore a reference to the national blessing and curse contained in the law&#8212;and the burden of it&#8212;after an ascription of praise to the Lord for the bestowment of the former, was an earnest supplication for deliverance from the latter. He specifies seven cases in which the merciful interposition of God would be required; and he earnestly bespeaks it on the condition of people praying towards that holy place. The blessing addressed to the people at the close is substantially a brief recapitulation of the preceding prayer [1Ki 8:56-61].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">There hath not failed one word of all his good promise:</span> see the like <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-45.htm" title="There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had spoken to the house of Israel; all came to pass.">Joshua 21:45</a> 23:14 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-10.htm" title="Know now that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD has done that which he spoke by his servant Elijah.">2 Kings 10:10</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Blessed be the Lord, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according, to all that he promised....

That place is now dedicated, and the king sees in this circumstance a proof that the rest is now at last fully attained. The permanent sanctuary is a pledge of settlement in the land. The rest hitherto enjoyed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-44.htm">Joshua 21:44</a>) had been but partial.

Bertheau follows the earlier commentators in admitting that these reasons refer not merely to the last petitions, but to all the preceding ones.<p>(Note: Seb. Schmidt has already given the following explanation: "These things which I have asked for myself and for my people do Thou, O Lord, because it is for Thy people that I have prayed, and I am their king: therefore hear Thou the prayers of Thy servant and Thy people. For in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-52.htm">1 Kings 8:52</a> he makes mention of his own case and of the cases of all the rest, in which they would call upon the Lord.)<p>The plea "for they are Thy people," etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-51.htm">1 Kings 8:51</a>), is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-10.htm">Deuteronomy 4:10</a>; and that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-53.htm">1 Kings 8:53</a>, "Thou didst separate them," etc., is taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-24.htm">Leviticus 20:24</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, "that Thine eyes may be opened," follows upon &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468; ("then hear Thou") in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-49.htm">1 Kings 8:49</a>; just as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a> at the commencement of the prayer follows upon &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-28.htm">1 Kings 8:28</a>. The recurrence of the same expression shows that the prayer is drawing to a close, and is rounded off by a return to the thought with which it opened. "As Thou spakest by Moses" points back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-40.htm">2 Chronicles 6:40-42</a> the conclusion of the prayer is somewhat altered, and closes with the appeal to the Lord to cause salvation and grace to go forth from the temple over His people. </body></html>
