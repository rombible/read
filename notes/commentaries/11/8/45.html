Fresh experiences of the truth of God's promises call for larger praises. He sues for grace and favour from God. The experiences we have of God's performing his promises, should encourage us to depend upon them, and to plead them with him; and those who expect further mercies, must be thankful for former mercies. God's promises must be the guide of our desires, and the ground of our hopes and expectations in prayer. The sacrifices, the incense, and the whole service of the temple, were all typical of the Redeemer's offices, oblation, and intercession. The temple, therefore, was continually to be remembered. Under one word, forgive, Solomon expressed all that he could ask in behalf of his people. For, as all misery springs from sin, forgiveness of sin prepares the way for the removal of every evil, and the receiving of every good. Without it, no deliverance can prove a blessing. In addition to the teaching of the word of God, Solomon entreated the Lord himself to teach the people to profit by all, even by their chastisements. They shall know every man the plague of his own heart, what it is that pains him; and shall spread their hands in prayer toward this house; whether the trouble be of body or mind, they shall represent it before God. Inward burdens seem especially meant. Sin is the plague of our own hearts; our in-dwelling corruptions are our spiritual diseases: every true Israelite endeavours to know these, that he may mortify them, and watch against the risings of them. These drive him to his knees; lamenting these, he spreads forth his hands in prayer. After many particulars, Solomon concludes with the general request, that God would hearken to his praying people. No place, now, under the gospel, can add to the prayers made in or towards it. The substance is Christ; whatever we ask in his name, it shall be given us. In this manner the Israel of God is established and sanctified, the backslider is recovered and healed. In this manner the stranger is brought nigh, the mourner is comforted, the name of God is glorified. Sin is the cause of all our troubles; repentance and forgiveness lead to all human happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee - Solomon prays that the result of Yahweh's hearing the prayers of pagans addressed toward the temple may be the general conversion of the world to the worship of Him. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/96-1.htm">Psalm 96:1-13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/98-1.htm">Psalm 98:1-9</a>.<p>This house ... - literally, as in the margin. In Scripture, when God's Name is said to be "called upon" persons or things, it seems to be meant that God is really present in them, upholding them and sanctifying them. This passage therefore means, that the pagan, when their prayers, directed toward the temple, are granted, will have a full assurance that God is present in the building in some very special way. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ki 8:22-61. His Prayer.<p>22. Solomon stood before the altar&#8212;This position was in the court of the people, on a brazen scaffold erected for the occasion (2Ch 6:13), fronting the altar of burnt offering, and surrounded by a mighty concourse of people. Assuming the attitude of a suppliant, kneeling (1Ki 8:54; compare 2Ch 6:24) and with uplifted hands, he performed the solemn act of consecration&#8212;an act remarkable, among other circumstances, for this, that it was done, not by the high priest or any member of the Aaronic family, but by the king in person, who might minister about, though not in, holy things. This sublime prayer [1Ki 8:22-35], which breathes sentiments of the loftiest piety blended with the deepest humility, naturally bore a reference to the national blessing and curse contained in the law&#8212;and the burden of it&#8212;after an ascription of praise to the Lord for the bestowment of the former, was an earnest supplication for deliverance from the latter. He specifies seven cases in which the merciful interposition of God would be required; and he earnestly bespeaks it on the condition of people praying towards that holy place. The blessing addressed to the people at the close is substantially a brief recapitulation of the preceding prayer [1Ki 8:56-61].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Declare the justice of their cause, by giving them the victory. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication,....

It has hence been too readily inferred that this portion of the prayer, at least, if not the preceding petition also, has been interpolated by a post-captivity writer. But there is really no solid reason for doubting its genuineness. Not only is it the <span class="accented">seventh</span> petition (see on ver. 31), but the captivity of Israel had been denounced as the punishment of persistent disobedience long before by Moses, and in the chapters to which such constant reference is made (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33, 44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25, 36, 64</a>; cf. 4:27) - a fact which is in itself an indirect proof of genuineness, as showing that this petition is of a piece with the rest of the prayer. And when to this we add that the carrying of a conquered and refractory race into captivity was an established custom of the East, we shall be inclined to agree with Bahr, that "it would have been more remarkable if Solomon had not mentioned it." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The fourth prayer relates to the removal of other land-plagues: famine (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-19.htm">Leviticus 26:19-20</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23</a>); pestilence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25</a>); blight and mildew in the corn (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-22.htm">Deuteronomy 28:22</a>); locusts (&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;, devourer, is connected with &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; without a copula, - in the Chronicles by Vv, - to depict the plague of locusts more vividly before their eyes after <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-38.htm">Deuteronomy 28:38</a>); oppression by enemies in their own land; lastly, plagues and diseases of all kinds, such as are threatened against the rebellious in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-59.htm">Deuteronomy 28:59-61</a>. &#1497;&#1510;&#1512; is not the imperfect Kal of &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; (Ges., Dietr., Frst, Olsh.

In all these cases may God hear his prayer, and do and give to every one according to his way. &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, "as Thou knowest his heart," i.e., as is profitable for every one according to the state of his heart of his disposition. God can do this, because He knows the hearts of all men (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>). The purpose assigned for all this hearing of prayer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-40.htm">1 Kings 8:40</a>), viz., "that they may fear Thee," etc., is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-10.htm">Deuteronomy 4:10</a>.</body></html>
