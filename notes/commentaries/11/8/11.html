The ark was fixed in the place appointed for its rest in the inner part of the house, whence they expected God to speak to them, even in the most holy place. The staves of the ark were drawn out, so as to direct the high priest to the mercy-seat over the ark, when he went in, once a year, to sprinkle the blood there; so that they continued of use, though there was no longer occasion to carry it by them. The glory of God appearing in a cloud may signify, 1. The darkness of that dispensation, in comparison with the light of the gospel, by which, with open face, we behold, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord. 2. The darkness of our present state, in comparison with the sight of God, which will be the happiness of heaven, where the Divine glory is unveiled.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As in the case of Moses <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-35.htm">Exodus 40:35</a>, so now the glory of the Lord, the manifestation of the divine presence, which the cloud usually veiled, shone forth from it with such brilliancy, that mortal man could not bear the sight. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10, 11. the cloud filled the house of the Lord&#8212;The cloud was the visible symbol of the divine presence, and its occupation of the sanctuary was a testimony of God's gracious acceptance of the temple as of the tabernacle (Ex 40:34). The dazzling brightness, or rather, perhaps, the dense portentous darkness of the cloud, struck the minds of the priests, as it formerly had done Moses, which such astonishment and terror (Le 16:2-13; De 4:24; Ex 40:35) that they could not remain. Thus the temple became the place where the divine glory was revealed, and the king of Israel established his royal residence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Because of the cloud; </span> because the cloud was either so bright that it dazzled their eyes; or rather so dark, that it struck them with horror and amazement, as is implied in the next verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So that the priests could not stand to minister, because of the cloud,.... Either through the darkness it first caused, or through the light that broke out of it, which was dazzling to them, or through the terror it struck their minds with; they could neither minister in the holy place, by offering incense there; and as for the most holy place, none but the high priest could minister there, and that on one day only; nor in the court of the priests, at the altar of burnt offerings: <p>for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord; a bright and glorious stream came forth from the cloud, and spread itself all over the house, and then took up its abode in the most holy place as in the tabernacle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_kings/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">could not stand to minister</span>] i.e. At the altar of incense which stood within the holy place.

It was at the moment when the singers and trumpeters, standing at the east end of the altar, began their service of praise - and the reappearance of the priests may well have been the signal for them to begin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13</a>) - that "the house was filled with a cloud." Possibly the priests were about to burn incense. Evidently ministrations of some sort were intended and were interrupted. The exact correspondence with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-35.htm">Exodus 40:35</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-4.htm">Ezekiel 44:4</a>) is not to be overlooked. The idea obviously is that the Divine approval vouchsafed to the tabernacle was now in turn granted to the temple], <span class="cmt_word">for the glory of the Lord had</span> <span class="cmt_word">filled the house of the Lord.</span> [Is the "glory of the Lord" identical with the cloud, or is something additional intended by these words? It is certainly noticeable that what ver. 10 says of the cloud - that it "filled the house" - ver. 11 says of the glory. It is also true that there is no mention of any light or fire. And the "darkness" of ver. 12 might naturally seem to refer to the cloud, and therefore to exclude the idea of light. But surely the words <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;</span> are to be interpreted here by their signification and use elsewhere, and we find "the glory of the <span class="accented">Lord</span> elsewhere mentioned as something distinct from the cloud. We must remember that what by day was a pillar of cloud, by night was a pillar <span class="accented">of fire</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21, 22</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9, 16</a>, the mention of the "thick cloud" is followed by the statement that "Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke because the Lord descended upon it <span class="accented">in fire"</span> (ver. 18). Similarly, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24</a>, we are told that "the glory of the Lord appeared upon Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it (the glory?) six days; and the seventh day He called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud. And the sight of the glory of the Lord was like <span class="accented">devouring fire</span> " (vers. 16, 17). But perhaps the most decisive passage in this connexion is <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>, where we are <span class="accented">told</span> that "the cloud abode <span class="accented">upon"</span> the tent of meeting, while "the glory of the Lord filled the (interior of the) tabernacle." Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-7.htm">Exodus 16:7, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-6.htm">Leviticus 9:6, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-10.htm">Numbers 14:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-19.htm">Numbers 16:19, 42</a>. It would appear, therefore, that "the glory of the Lord" was not the cloud, but,  as the word almost seems to imply, a "light from heaven above the brightness of the sun" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-13.htm">Acts 26:13</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14, 16</a>). It is hardly necessary to add that the glory, though apparently resident in the cloud, was not always luminous; the cloud veiled it from the eyes of men. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And king Solomon and the whole congregation, that had gathered round him, were with him before the ark sacrificing sheep and oxen in innumerable multitude." This took place while the ark of the covenant was carried up, no doubt when it was brought into the court of the temple, and was set down there for a time either within or in front of the hall. Then was this magnificent sacrifice "offered" there "in front of the ark" (&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;).</body></html>
