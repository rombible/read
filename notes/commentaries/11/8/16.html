As there were temporary resting places for the ark—such as Gilgal, Shiloh, Kirjathjearim, and Zion—so there were rulers raised up successively for a time, and then removed. Now there was to be one fixed place as the Sanctuary of God, and one royal house of David to continue for ever.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:12-21 Solomon encouraged the priests, who were much astonished at the dark cloud. The dark dispensations of Providence should quicken us in fleeing for refuge to the hope of the gospel. Nothing can more reconcile us to them, than to consider what God has said, and to compare his word and works together. Whatever good we do, we must look on it as the performance of God's promise to us, not of our promises to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The marginal reference completes the sense of this verse here.

When the priests came out of the sanctuary, after putting the ark of the covenant in its place, the cloud filled the house of Jehovah, so that the priests could not stand to minister. The signification of this fact was the same on both occasions. The cloud, as the visible symbol of the gracious presence of God, filled the temple, as a sign that Jehovah the covenant-God had entered into it, and had chosen it as the scene of His gracious manifestation in Israel. By the inability of the priests to stand, we are not to understand that the cloud drove them away; for it was not till the priests had come out that it filled the temple. It simply means that they could not remain in the Holy Place to perform service, say to offer an incense-offering upon the altar to consecrate it, just as sacrifices were offered upon the altar of burnt-offering after the dedicatory prayer (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-62.htm">1 Kings 8:62</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>).<p>(Note: Bertheau's opinion (on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-14.htm">2 Chronicles 5:14</a>), that the priests could not remain in the hall and in front of it on account of the cloud, namely, "the cloud of smoke, which, ascending from the sacrifices burned upon the altar of burnt-offering, concealed the glory of the Lord," is decidedly erroneous. For the cloud which hindered the priest from performing the service was, according to the distinct words of the text, the cloud which filled the house; and the explanatory clause, "for the glory of the Lord filled the house of Jehovah," indicates in the most unmistakeable terms that it was the vehicle of the glory of God, and therefore was no a cloud of smoke formed by the burning sacrifices, but the cloud in which God manifested His invisible being to His people, - the very same cloud in which Jehovah was to appear above the Capporeth, when the high priest entered the Most Holy Place on the day of atonement, so that he was commanded not to enter it at all times, and, when he entered, to cover the Capporeth with the cloud of the burning incense (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-13.htm">Leviticus 16:13</a>).<p>The glory of the Lord, which is like a consuming fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-17.htm">Exodus 24:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-3.htm">Deuteronomy 9:3</a>), before which unholy man cannot stand, manifested itself in the cloud. This marvellous manifestation of the glory of God took place only at the dedication; after that the cloud was only visible in the Most Holy Place on the great day of atonement, when the high priest entered it. - The Chronicles contain a long account at this place of the playing and singing of the Levites at these solemnities (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12-14</a>).</body></html>
