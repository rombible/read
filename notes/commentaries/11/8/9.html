There was <span class="ital">nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone</span>] We read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-4.htm" title="Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;">Hebrews 9:4</a> that in the ark of the covenant ‘was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded’ as well as the tables of the covenant, and we may be sure that the writer there speaks according to tradition. The Old Testament narrative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-34.htm" title="As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.">Exodus 16:34</a>) says that the pot of manna was laid up ‘before the testimony’ and the same expression is used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/17-10.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and you shall quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.">Numbers 17:10</a>) concerning Aaron’s rod. This does not define whether they were put inside or on the outside of the ark. But it is most probable that during the time when the ark was moved from place to place they were kept inside it, but as soon as it was placed within the Temple they were removed. For the tables of stone were alone intended to be stored in the ark, being ‘the testimony (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-16.htm" title="And you shall put into the ark the testimony which I shall give you.">Exodus 25:16</a>) which God had given to Israel.’ The other things would still be ‘before the testimony’ if they were placed outside.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">when the Lord made</span> a covenant] There is no word for ‘covenant’ in the Hebrew, but the verb is the technical term used in this sense, meaning literally ‘to cut’ in allusion to the sacrifices which usually accompanied covenant-making. No doubt by this time the verb alone had come to have the sense of ‘making a covenant.’ So the italics of the A. V. are rather misleading. The same verb without any noun following is found in this sense <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-2.htm" title="And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach on all Israel.">1 Samuel 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-16.htm" title="So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.">1 Samuel 20:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-18.htm" title="Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and you shall be missed, because your seat will be empty.">1 Samuel 20:18</a> and in other places. The verse is a little expanded but not changed in sense in the LXX.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Josephus adds here an account of the other furniture of the Temple, with the position which it occupied, and adds, what no doubt he had seen in his own time, that the brazen altar stood before the shrine, straight opposite the outer door, so that when that was thrown open the altar was visible, and the priestly acts and the completion of the sacrifice could all be seen. This is, in a way, a comment on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-8.htm" title="And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are to this day.">1 Kings 8:8</a>. The people outside could see through all the length of the holy place, but only one coming near to the partition, could, when the door into the most holy was open, notice the extended heads of the staves.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there</span> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-20.htm">Exodus 40:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-5.htm">Deuteronomy 10:5</a>. This statement appears to be at variance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>, which mentions "the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded," as in the ark, along with "the tables of the covenant." And it is to be observed that, while our text excludes these relics from the ark (<span class="accented">temp</span>. Solomon), no other scripture save that just cited expressly includes them. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-34.htm">Exodus 16:34</a> and Numbers 17:25 (Heb. A.V., Numbers 17:10) they are commanded to be laid up "before the testimony," words which no doubt may mean, as they were long interpreted to mean, "before the tables of testimony in the ark" - observe, the words are "before the <span class="accented">testimony</span>," not "before the <span class="accented">ark"</span> <span class="accented">-</span> but which are now generally thought to import "in front of the ark which con-rained the testimony." We know the book of the law was put "at the side (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>) of the ark" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-26.htm">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>), and hence it is held by some that the golden pot, etc., occupied a similar position. It seems preferable, however, considering the distinct statement of St. Paul, or the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, which, to say the least, embodies Jewish tradition, to adhere to the ancient interpretation that the golden pot of manna and Aaron's rod were in the ark. And this in no wise conflicts with the statement of the text, for these treasures might well have been removed by the Philistines, whose first thought, we may be sure, would be to open their new acquisition. It is not improbable, indeed, that the object of the men of Bethshemesh in looking into the ark was to see whether these treasures were still there. For if the golden pot ever was in the ark, we can hardly suppose it would escape the rapacity of the Philistines, who would leave the two tables of stone as things of no value. Indeed, it is just possible that the trespass offering, the golden mice, etc., were designed as a return for the golden pot which had been removed. And the statement of the text, "there was nothing," etc., almost implies that there had been something there at one time (see Alford on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>). It seem probable, therefore, that the golden pot and Aaron's rod were originally deposited "before the testimony" in the ark; that they were removed during its captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-6.htm">1 Samuel 5:6</a>.);  and that the sacrilege was discovered at Bethshemesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>). This last mentioned episode explains how it came to be known that "there was nothing," etc. It is hardly likely after that memorable visitation that Solomon could have opened the ark and taken out the two relics, as Rawlinson suggests. Nor have we any warrant for the view that the mercy seat, with the cherubs, was removed to make way for a new lid without them, and so the interior of the ark was disclosed to view (Stanley) ] <span class="cmt_word">at Horeb</span> [See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-6.htm">Exodus 33:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8</a>.

The expression &#1488;&#1514;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, which follows, introduces as a supplementary notice, according to the general diffuseness of the early Hebrew style of narrative, the more precise statement that the priests and Levites brought up these sacred vessels. &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; &#1488;&#1492;&#1500; is not the tent erected for the ark of the covenant upon Zion, which can be proved to have been never so designated, and which is expressly distinguished from the former in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-4.htm">2 Chronicles 1:4</a> as compared with <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-3.htm">1 Kings 8:3</a>, but is the Mosaic tabernacle at Gibeon in front of which Solomon had offered sacrifice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4</a>). The tabernacle with the vessels in it, to which, however, the ark of the covenant, that had long been separated from it, did not belong, was probably preserved as a sacred relic in the rooms above the Most Holy Place. The ark of the covenant was carried by priests on all solemn occasions, according to the spirit of the law, which enjoined, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-31.htm">Numbers 3:31</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-5.htm">Numbers 4:5</a>., that the ark of the covenant and the rest of the sacred vessels should be carried by the Levites, after the priests had carefully wrapped them up; and the Levites were prohibited from directly touching them, on pain of death. When, therefore, the ark of the covenant was carried in solemn procession, as in the case before us, probably uncovered, this could only be done by the priests, more especially as the Levites were not allowed to enter the Most Holy Place. Consequently, by the statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-3.htm">1 Kings 8:3</a>, that the priests and Levites carried them (&#1488;&#1514;&#1501;), viz., the objects mentioned before, we are to understand that the ark of the covenant was carried into the temple by the priests, and the tabernacle with its vessels by the Levites.<p>(Note: Instead of &#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-3.htm">1 Kings 8:3</a>, we have &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-4.htm">2 Chronicles 5:4</a>; and instead of &#1493;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-4.htm">1 Kings 8:4</a>, we have &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, "the Levitical priests." These variations are to be attributed to inexactness in expression. For it is obvious that Thenius is wrong in his notion that the chronicler mentioned the Levites instead of the priests, from the simple fact that he states in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-7.htm">1 Kings 8:7</a> that "the priests carried the ark," etc., in exact agreement with our account.)</body></html>
