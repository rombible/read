That the case contemplated is probably not imaginary, is shown by the examples of King Hiram and the Queen of Sheba. Admiration of the glory of Israel would lead inevitably to some belief in, and “fear” of, the God of Israel; and it might well go on to the further result, here contemplated, of a fuller acknowledgment of the Lord Jehovah, and of the sacredness of the worship of His appointed Temple, which would tell silently on all the religions of the East. It was expressly provided for in the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/15-14.htm" title="And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whoever be among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD; as you do, so he shall do.">Numbers 15:14-16</a>): and in spite of the greater exclusiveness of the ages after the Captivity, heathen princes were often allowed to offer in the Temple. This recognition of the stranger from afar is different from the frequent recognition of the resident “stranger within their gates,” as being under the protection of God, and to be “loved” by those who had been “strangers in the land of Egypt” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/10-18.htm" title="He does execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loves the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.">Deuteronomy 10:18-19</a>). But, like it, it nobly distinguished the Law of Israel from most ancient codes; it stood out as a striking, though often unheeded, protest against the hard exclusiveness of the Jewish temper; it was a tacit anticipation of the future gathering in of all nations to enjoy the blessing which was from the beginning expressly destined for “all families of the earth.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/8-41.htm" title="Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of your people Israel, but comes out of a far country for your name's sake;...">1 Kings 8:41-42</a></span>. <span class="ital">Moreover, concerning a stranger — </span>The case of an alien, who is not an Israelite is next mentioned; a proselyte that might come to the temple to pray to the God of Israel, being convinced of the folly and wickedness of worshipping the gods of his country.

Fresh experiences of the truth of God's promises call for larger praises. He sues for grace and favour from God. The experiences we have of God's performing his promises, should encourage us to depend upon them, and to plead them with him; and those who expect further mercies, must be thankful for former mercies. God's promises must be the guide of our desires, and the ground of our hopes and expectations in prayer. The sacrifices, the incense, and the whole service of the temple, were all typical of the Redeemer's offices, oblation, and intercession. The temple, therefore, was continually to be remembered. Under one word, forgive, Solomon expressed all that he could ask in behalf of his people. For, as all misery springs from sin, forgiveness of sin prepares the way for the removal of every evil, and the receiving of every good. Without it, no deliverance can prove a blessing. In addition to the teaching of the word of God, Solomon entreated the Lord himself to teach the people to profit by all, even by their chastisements. They shall know every man the plague of his own heart, what it is that pains him; and shall spread their hands in prayer toward this house; whether the trouble be of body or mind, they shall represent it before God. Inward burdens seem especially meant. Sin is the plague of our own hearts; our in-dwelling corruptions are our spiritual diseases: every true Israelite endeavours to know these, that he may mortify them, and watch against the risings of them. These drive him to his knees; lamenting these, he spreads forth his hands in prayer. After many particulars, Solomon concludes with the general request, that God would hearken to his praying people. No place, now, under the gospel, can add to the prayers made in or towards it. The substance is Christ; whatever we ask in his name, it shall be given us. In this manner the Israel of God is established and sanctified, the backslider is recovered and healed. In this manner the stranger is brought nigh, the mourner is comforted, the name of God is glorified. Sin is the cause of all our troubles; repentance and forgiveness lead to all human happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Nothing is more remarkable in the Mosaic Law than its liberality with regard to strangers, both in general <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-19.htm">Deuteronomy 10:19</a> and in religious matters <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-14.htm">Numbers 15:14-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-12.htm">Deuteronomy 31:12</a>.

His Prayer.<p>22. Solomon stood before the altar&#8212;This position was in the court of the people, on a brazen scaffold erected for the occasion (2Ch 6:13), fronting the altar of burnt offering, and surrounded by a mighty concourse of people. Assuming the attitude of a suppliant, kneeling (1Ki 8:54; compare 2Ch 6:24) and with uplifted hands, he performed the solemn act of consecration&#8212;an act remarkable, among other circumstances, for this, that it was done, not by the high priest or any member of the Aaronic family, but by the king in person, who might minister about, though not in, holy things. This sublime prayer [1Ki 8:22-35], which breathes sentiments of the loftiest piety blended with the deepest humility, naturally bore a reference to the national blessing and curse contained in the law&#8212;and the burden of it&#8212;after an ascription of praise to the Lord for the bestowment of the former, was an earnest supplication for deliverance from the latter. He specifies seven cases in which the merciful interposition of God would be required; and he earnestly bespeaks it on the condition of people praying towards that holy place. The blessing addressed to the people at the close is substantially a brief recapitulation of the preceding prayer [1Ki 8:56-61].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This may note either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-21.htm" title="You shall neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.">Exodus 22:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-9.htm" title="Also you shall not oppress a stranger: for you know the heart of a stranger, seeing you were strangers in the land of Egypt.">Exodus 23:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-12.htm" title="Six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you shall rest: that your ox and your ass may rest, and the son of your handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.">Exodus 23:12</a>, &c. So he is not to be excluded from spiritual privileges. Josephus makes Solomon enlarge on this characteristic thus: “And I do not ask from Thee this help for the Hebrews alone when they offend; but even if any come from the ends of the earth, or from any land whatever and wish in this place to make petition unto Thee, hearken and grant their request. For thus it will be known to all men that Thou hast wished this house to be built for Thee by us, and that we are not unnatural nor hostile to strangers, but gladly desire that Thy help and the advantage of Thy blessings should be shared by all.” The last sentence tells of the opinion, which in the days of Josephus prevailed among the heathen, that the Jews were haters of the rest of mankind. For this sentiment cf. Juvenal XIV. 103, 104. Tac. <span class="ital">Hist.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-5.htm" title="And, behold, I purpose to build an house to the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke to David my father, saying, Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your room, he shall build an house to my name.">1 Kings 5:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for thy name’s sake</span>] i.e. Having heard of Thy wondrous works performed for Israel.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;</span> [Solomon takes it for granted that such will come, and not without good reason, for the house was "exceeding magnifical" and destined to be "of fame and glory throughout all countries" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-5.htm">1 Chronicles 22:5</a>). And we can hardly doubt that in the visit of the Queen of Sheba we are to see one fulfilment of this anticipation. (Note the expression of ch. 10:1 "concerning the <span class="accented">name of the Lord</span>.") One who blessed God, as she did (ver. 9), would certainly pray towards the house. In the time of the <span class="accented">second</span> temple there were several instances of strangers (<span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>., Alexander the Great, Ptolemy Philadelphus, and Seleucus; see Keil <span class="accented">in loc</span>.) worshipping the God of Jacob in Jerusalem. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The third prayer refers to the remission of the punishment of drought threatened against the land, when the heaven is shut up, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-19.htm">Leviticus 26:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-17.htm">Deuteronomy 11:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23</a>. &#1514;&#1506;&#1504;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, because Thou humblest them (lxx, Vulg.); not "that Thou hearest them" (Chald. and others). &#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, because Thou teachest them the good way. These words correspond to &#1499;&#1497; &#1514;&#1506;&#1504;&#1501;, and contain a motive for forgiveness. Because God teaches His people and seeks by means of chastisements to bring them back to the good way when they fail to keep His commandments, He must forgive when they recognise the punishment as a divine chastisement and come to Him with penitential prayer.</body></html>
