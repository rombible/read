And he wrote on the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.">Exodus 34:28</a>). This remarkable application of the word “covenant” illustrates strikingly the characteristics of the Divine covenants with man. Such covenants are not (like most human covenants) undertakings of reciprocal engagements between parties regarded as independent. For such a conception of the relation between God and man is monstrous. God’s covenants proceed simply from His will, expressed in His call to an individual or a nation. They begin in free grace and blessing from Him; they require simply that men should believe and accept His call, and act in obedience to that belief. Thus the Decalogue opens with the words, “I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage,” describing the gift of salvation from the mercy of God, which constituted Israel afresh as His peculiar people. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/3-7.htm" title="And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;">Exodus 3:7-15</a>.) On the ground of this salvation, rather than of His Omnipotence as Creator and Sustainer of the world, He calls for their obedience to the commandments, which are thus “the words of the covenant.” Similarly St. Paul, when (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a>) he calls Christians to absolute self-devotion, appeals to them by “the mercies of God,” on which he had so fully dwelt—the larger and more spiritual covenant in Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-21.htm" title="And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.">1 Kings 8:21</a></span>. <span class="ital">I have set there a place for the ark — </span>The token of God’s presence with us; <span class="ital">wherein is the covenant of the Lord — </span>That is, the tables of the covenant, in which are written the conditions of God’s covenant with our fathers. <span class="ital">When he brought them out of the land of Egypt — </span>And declared to them that by the tenure of this covenant they were to hold the land of Canaan.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:12-21 Solomon encouraged the priests, who were much astonished at the dark cloud. The dark dispensations of Providence should quicken us in fleeing for refuge to the hope of the gospel. Nothing can more reconcile us to them, than to consider what God has said, and to compare his word and works together.

The prayer of dedication, properly so called, now begins. This solemn and beautiful composition was probably copied by our author from the "Book of the Acts of Solomon" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-41.htm">1 Kings 11:41</a>), possibly from the "Book of Nathan the prophet" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-29.htm">2 Chronicles 9:29</a>). It was evidently committed to writing beforehand, and would, no doubt, as a matter of course, be religiously preserved. The later criticism objects to its authenticity that the many references to the Pentateuch (compare ver. 12 with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>; ver. 31 with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-11.htm">Exodus 22:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>; ver. 33 with <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>; ver. 36 with <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25</a>; ver. 50 with <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-40.htm">Leviticus 26:40, 42</a>; ver. 51 with <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>, etc.) prove it to be of a later date. Ewald assigns it to the  <span class="date">seventh century B.C.</span>; but this is simply to beg the question of the date of the Pentateuch. It is obviously open to reply that these references only prove that the king was acquainted, as he was bound to be (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18</a>), with the words of the law. It divides itself into three parts. The first (vers. 22-30) is general; the second (vers. 31-53) consists of seven special petitions; the last (vers. 50-53) consists of a general conclusion and appeal to God's covenant mercy. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Solomon extols this marvellous proof of the favour of the Lord. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-12.htm">1 Kings 8:12</a>. Then spake Solomon, "Jehovah hath spoken to dwell in the darkness." "Solomon saw that the temple was filled with a cloud, and remembered that God had been pleased to appear in a cloud in the tent of Moses also. Hence he assuredly believed that God was in this cloud also, and that, as formerly He had filled the tabernacle, so He would now fill the temple and dwell therein" (Seb. Schmidt). &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, which Thenius still renders incorrectly, "the Lord intends to dwell in the darkness," refers, as Rashi, C. a Lap., and others have seen, to the utterances of God in the Pentateuch concerning the manifestation of His gracious presence among His people, not merely to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2</a> (I will appear in the cloud), but also to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>, where the Lord said to Moses, "I come to thee &#1492;&#1506;&#1504;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;," and still more to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-21.htm">Exodus 20:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-11.htm">Deuteronomy 4:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-19.htm">Deuteronomy 5:19</a>, according to which God came down upon Sinai &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1508;&#1500;. Solomon took the word &#1506;&#1512;&#1508;&#1500; from these passages. That he meant by this the black, dark cloud which filled the temple, is perfectly obvious from the combination &#1493;&#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1508;&#1500; &#1492;&#1506;&#1504;&#1503; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-19.htm">Deuteronomy 5:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-11.htm">Deuteronomy 4:11</a>.<p>(Note: Thenius, however, has built up all kinds of untenable conjectures as to alterations of the text, upon the erroneous assumption that &#1506;&#1504;&#1503; means the light and radiant cloud, and cannot be synonymous with &#1506;&#1512;&#1508;&#1500;. Bttcher adopts the same opinion, without taking any notice of the striking remarks of Bertheau on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-14.htm">2 Chronicles 5:14</a>.)<p>Solomon saw this word of Jehovah realized in the filling of the temple with the cloud, and learned therefrom that the Lord would dwell in this temple. Hence, being firmly convinced of the presence of Jehovah in the cloud which filled the sanctuary, he adds in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-13.htm">1 Kings 8:13</a> : "I have built Thee a house to dwell in, a place for Thy seat for ever." We are not to understand &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; as signifying that Solomon believed that the temple built by him would stand for ever; but it is to be explained partly from the contrast to the previous abode of God in the tabernacle, which from the very nature of the case could only be a temporary one, inasmuch as a tent, such as the tabernacle was, is not only a moveable and provisional dwelling, but also a very perishable one, and partly from the promise given to David in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14-16</a>, that the Lord would establish the throne of his kingdom for his seed for ever. This promise involved the eternal duration of the gracious connection between God and Israel, which was embodied in the dwelling of God in the temple. This connection, from its very nature, was an eternal one; even if the earthly form, from which Solomon at that moment abstracted himself, was temporal and perishable. - Solomon had spoken these words with his face turned to the Most Holy Place. He then (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-14.htm">1 Kings 8:14</a>) turned his face to the congregation, which was standing in the court, and blessed it. The word "blessed" (&#1497;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498;) denotes the wish for a blessing with which the king greeted the assembled congregation, and introduced the praise of God which follows. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-15.htm">1 Kings 8:15-21</a> he praises the Lord for having now fulfilled with His hand what He spake with His mouth to his father David (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>).</body></html>
