The hasty preparation is made by the use of the wooden implements for fuel, as in the sacrifice at the threshing-floor of Araunah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-22.htm" title="And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.">2Samuel 24:22</a>). Henceforth from a master he became a servant, ministering to Elijah, and willing to be known, even when he became himself the prophet of God, as “he that poured water on the hands of Elijah” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-11.htm" title="But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him?

It is of great advantage to young ministers to spend some time under the direction of those that are aged and experienced; and not to think much, if occasion be, to minister unto them. Those who would be fit to teach, must have time to learn: those should first serve, who may hereafter rule. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:19-21 Elijah found Elisha by Divine direction, not in the schools of the prophets, but in the field; not reading, or praying, or sacrificing, but ploughing. Idleness is no man's honour, nor is husbandry any man's disgrace. An honest calling in the world, does not put us out of the way of our heavenly calling, any more than it did Elisha. His heart was touched by the Holy Spirit, and he was ready to leave all to attend Elijah. It is in a day of power that Christ's subjects are made willing; nor would any come to Christ unless they were thus drawn. It was a discouraging time for prophets to set out in. A man that had consulted with flesh and blood, would not be fond of Elijah's mantle; yet Elisha cheerfully leaves all to accompany him. When the Saviour said to one and to another, Follow me, the dearest friends and most profitable occupations were cheerfully left, and the most arduous duties done from love to his name. May we, in like manner, feel the energy of his grace working in us mightily, and by unreserved submission at once, may we make our calling and election sure.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Elisha returns to his oxen and laborers. He indicates his relinquishment of his home and calling by the slaughter of the particular yoke of oxen with which he had himself been plowing, probably the best beasts of the twelve, and by burning the "instruments," the p oughs and yokes, both made of wood. Next he feasts his people to show his gratitude for his call, Elijah apparently remaining the while; and then, leaving father and mother, cattle and land, good position and comfortable home, Elisha became the "minister" to the wanderer.

There is nothing to guide us in deciding whether the feast was made at the place where the call was received, or whether it was a meal given in the home to which Elisha went to bid adieu to his parents. It seems however more natural to understand it of the latter. At such a parting meal the parents of him who was going away were hardly likely to be absent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Because the word rendered ‘slew’ in this verse, is very frequently translated ‘sacrificed’ some have thought that the ceremony here described was a religious one. But there is no mention of an altar, which would have been necessary, nor of the devotion of any part of the slain beasts as an offering. The guests were invited to a family feast, after the patriarchal fashion, and joined in the festivities attendant on such an occasion. The parents of Elisha were perhaps likeminded with himself and felt the grandeur of the office to which he was called. In that case the feeling of joyous thankfulness would be the most prevalent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">went after Elijah, and ministered unto him</span>] Josephus adds to the narrative, that ‘Elisha immediately began to prophesy.’ In the Scripture story he is not mentioned again till the departure of Elijah into heaven is close at hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.">2 Kings 2:1</a>). But we cannot doubt that he was the companion of Elijah from that day forward, and we are shewn something of the nature of the attendance and ministration here alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-11.htm" title="But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.">2 Kings 3:11</a>, where we read of Elisha as he ‘which poured water on the hands of Elijah.’ The members of the prophetic school seem to have lived after the fashion of ‘Brethren of the common life,’ and the less prominent members did service of every kind for those who were at the head.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he returned back from him</span> [Wordsworth is not warranted in affirming that Elisha "did <span class="accented">not</span> go back and kiss," etc. The text rather implies that he did], <span class="cmt_word">and took a yoke</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">the yoke</span>; Cf. ver. 19] <span class="cmt_word">of oxen, and slew them</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">sacrificed</span>; LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>.

The scarcity of timber may have had something to do with this application of the "instruments of the oxen;" but it is much more important to see it in a symbolical act, expressive of Elisha's entire renunciation of his secular calling. He would henceforth need them no longer.
