The “undesigned coincidence,” in relation to the renewed intercourse with Zidon, is remarkable.<p><span class= "bld">All the cities . . .</span>—Possibly the cities ceded by Ben-hadad, and rebuilt as strongholds. The description shows that Ahab’s reign was externally one of power and prosperity, as yet unimpaired even by his death and disaster at Ramoth-gilead.

See what they get that join with wicked men. How can it be expected that he should be true to his friend, who has been false to his God! He had said in compliment to Ahab, I am as thou art, and now he was indeed taken for him. Those that associate with evil-doers, are in danger of sharing in their plagues. By Jehoshaphat's deliverance, God let him know, that though he was displeased with him, yet he had not deserted him. God is a friend that will not fail us when other friends do. Let no man think to hide himself from God's judgment. God directed the arrow to hit Ahab; those cannot escape with life, whom God has doomed to death. Ahab lived long enough to see part of Micaiah's prophecy accomplished. He had time to feel himself die; with what horror must he have thought upon the wickedness he had committed!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The ivory house - So called from the character of its ornamentation.

The Syrian king, with a view either to put the speediest end to the war, or perhaps to wipe out the stain of his own humiliation (1Ki 20:31), had given special instructions to his generals to single out Ahab, and to take or kill him, as the author of the war. The officers at first directed their assault on Jehoshaphat, but, becoming aware of their mistake, desisted. Ahab was wounded by a random arrow, which, being probably poisoned, and the state of the weather increasing the virulence of the poison, he died at sunset. The corpse was conveyed to Samaria; and, as the chariot which brought it was being washed, in a pool near the city, from the blood that had profusely oozed from the wound, the dogs, in conformity with Elijah's prophecy, came and licked it [1Ki 21:19]. Ahab was succeeded by his son Ahaziah [1Ki 22:40].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The ivory house, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">the house of the tooth or teeth</span>, to wit, of elephants: see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-18.htm" title="Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.">1 Kings 10:18</a></span>.

The house was of course not of ivory, but largely adorned with it. That such adornment prevailed in Oriental lands, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-15.htm" title="And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, said the LORD.">Amos 3:15</a>. The family of Ahab were great builders. It was the father of this king who in his short reign built Samaria, and Ahab apparently built several cities, i.e. perhaps restored and beautified them. Omri’s building of Samaria, however, was the founding of a new capital.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made</span> [So called because it was adorned with ivory.

Then Jehoshaphat cried out; and from this they perceived that he was not the king of Israel, and turned away from him. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1488;&#1498; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, "and they thought, it is only (i.e., no other than) the king of Israel." &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1497;&#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, "they bent upon him."

How far Jehoshaphat was saved by his crying out, is not precisely stated. He probably cried out to his followers to come to his aid, from which the Syrians discovered that he was not the king of Israel, whom they were in search of. The chronicler adds (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-18.htm">1 Kings 2:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-31.htm">1 Kings 2:31</a>): "and the Lord helped him and turned them off from him;" thus believingly tracing the rescue of the king to its higher causality, though without our having any right to infer from this that Jehoshaphat cried aloud to God for help, which is not implied in the words of the Chronicles.</body></html>
