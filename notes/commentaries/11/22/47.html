The “king of Edom,” of 2 Kings 3, who is evidently a subject ally, not regarded in consultation (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/22-6.htm" title="Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear?

It appears by the present passage that the country had been again reduced either by Jehoshaphat, or by an earlier king, and was dependent on the kingdom of Judah, being governed by a "deputy" or viceroy, who, however, was allowed the royal title (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-9.htm">2 Kings 3:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-12.htm">2 Kings 3:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-26.htm">2 Kings 3:26</a>). This government of dependencies by means of subject-kings was the all but universal practice in the East down to the time of Cyrus (the <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a> note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29-38. went up to Ramoth-gilead&#8212;The king of Israel, bent on this expedition, marched, accompanied by his ally, with all his forces to the siege; but on approaching the scene of action, his courage failed, and, hoping to evade the force of Micaiah's prophecy by a secret stratagem, he assumed the uniform of a subaltern, while he advised Jehoshaphat to fight in his royal attire. The Syrian king, with a view either to put the speediest end to the war, or perhaps to wipe out the stain of his own humiliation (1Ki 20:31), had given special instructions to his generals to single out Ahab, and to take or kill him, as the author of the war. The officers at first directed their assault on Jehoshaphat, but, becoming aware of their mistake, desisted. Ahab was wounded by a random arrow, which, being probably poisoned, and the state of the weather increasing the virulence of the poison, he died at sunset. The corpse was conveyed to Samaria; and, as the chariot which brought it was being washed, in a pool near the city, from the blood that had profusely oozed from the wound, the dogs, in conformity with Elijah's prophecy, came and licked it [1Ki 21:19]. Ahab was succeeded by his son Ahaziah [1Ki 22:40].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Sent and set over them by the kings of Judah, from the time of David, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-14.htm" title="And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants.

Nor is there anything to guide us to a conclusion by whom the deputy was appointed. It may be that Hadad had never gained much power after his return from Egypt, and his successor had not been able to maintain his position. In that case the king of Judah might have claimed the rights which his predecessor had once held, and have set up a governor in Edom. If this were so a passage for the servants of the king of Judah through the land would be a matter of course.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was then no king in Edom: a deputy</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span>, same word as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-7.htm">1 Kings 4:7</a>.
