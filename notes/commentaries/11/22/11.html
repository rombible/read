They will be drawn to wink at and countenance such conduct and conversation as they ought to protest against with abhorrence. Whithersoever a good man goes, he ought to take his religion with him, and not be ashamed to own it when he is with those who have no regard for it. Jehoshaphat had not left behind him, at Jerusalem, his affection and reverence for the word of the Lord, but avowed it, and endeavoured to bring it into Ahab's court. And Ahab's prophets, to please Jehoshaphat, made use of the name of Jehovah: to please Ahab, they said, Go up. But the false prophets cannot so mimic the true, but that he who has spiritual senses exercised, can discern the fallacy. One faithful prophet of the Lord was worth them all. Wordly men have in all ages been alike absurd in their views of religion. They would have the preacher fit his doctrine to the fashion of the times, and the taste of the hearers, and yet to add. Thus saith the Lord, to words that men would put into their mouths. They are ready to cry out against a man as rude and foolish, who scruples thus to try to secure his own interests, and to deceive others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Horns of iron - The horn in Scripture is the favorite symbol of power; and pushing with the horn is a common metaphor for attacking and conquering enemies (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>; Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-5.htm">Psalm 44:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-4.htm">Daniel 8:4</a>).

Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron&#8212;Small projections, of the size and form of our candle extinguishers (worn in many parts of the East as military ornaments), were worn by the Syrians of that time, and probably by the Israelite warriors also. Zedekiah, by assuming two horns, personated two heroes, and, pretending to be a prophet, wished in this manner to represent the kings of Israel and Judah in a military triumph. It was a symbolic action, to impart greater force to his language (see De 33:17); but it was little more than a flourish with a spontoon [Calmet, Fragments].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Horns of iron; </span> fit emblems of the power and victory of these two kings.

His action here is one of those symbolical proceedings not uncommon with the prophets. Thus Ahijah significantly rent his garment into twelve pieces (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-30.htm" title="And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces:">1 Kings 11:30</a>) and gave Jeroboam ten. Zedekiah’s language, addressed to Ahab, is probably an allusion to the blessing of Ephraim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-17.htm" title="His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>. By this time Ephraim had become the representative tribe of the Northern Kingdom, and of him Moses had said ‘his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth.’ By such language not only Ahab, but Jehoshaphat might be encouraged to trust more to the prophecies of success.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">until</span> thou <span class="ital">have consumed them</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">until they be consumed</span>.

But the reference is clearly to the horns of a bullock, and the appropriateness of the prophetic act is only manifest when we remember that Ephraim is compared to a bullock (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>), and more, that Moses spake beforehand of the strength of his horns, and predicted that with them he should "<span class="accented">push the people</span> together to the ends of the earth." Not only, that is to say, was the horn a familiar Oriental symbol of power (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-3.htm">2 Samuel 22:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-24.htm">Psalm 89:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-10.htm">Psalm 92:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-21.htm">Daniel 7:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-8.htm">Daniel 8:8</a>, etc.), but it was identified in a peculiar manner with the powerful tribe of Ephraim; in ether words, with the kingdom of Israel This symbolical act was not necessarily an imitation of the action of Ahijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-30.htm">1 Kings 11:30</a>).

These 400 prophets are neither the 400 prophets of Asherah who had not appeared upon Carmel when Elijah was there (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19-20</a>), nor prophets of Baal, as some of the earlier commentators supposed, since Ahab could not inquire of them &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;. On the other hand, they were not "true prophets of Jehovah and disciples of the prophets" (Cler., Then.), but prophets of Jehovah worshipped under the image of an ox, who practised prophesying as a trade without any call from God, and even if they were not in the pay of the idolatrous kings of Israel, were at any rate in their service. For Jehoshaphat did not recognise them as genuine prophets of Jehovah, but inquired whether there was not such a prophet still in existence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-7.htm">1 Kings 22:7</a>), that they might inquire the will of the Lord of him (&#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493;).</body></html>
