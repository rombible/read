He had said in compliment to Ahab, I am as thou art, and now he was indeed taken for him. Those that associate with evil-doers, are in danger of sharing in their plagues. By Jehoshaphat's deliverance, God let him know, that though he was displeased with him, yet he had not deserted him. God is a friend that will not fail us when other friends do. Let no man think to hide himself from God's judgment. God directed the arrow to hit Ahab; those cannot escape with life, whom God has doomed to death.

The Syrian king, with a view either to put the speediest end to the war, or perhaps to wipe out the stain of his own humiliation (1Ki 20:31), had given special instructions to his generals to single out Ahab, and to take or kill him, as the author of the war. The officers at first directed their assault on Jehoshaphat, but, becoming aware of their mistake, desisted. Ahab was wounded by a random arrow, which, being probably poisoned, and the state of the weather increasing the virulence of the poison, he died at sunset. The corpse was conveyed to Samaria; and, as the chariot which brought it was being washed, in a pool near the city, from the blood that had profusely oozed from the wound, the dogs, in conformity with Elijah's prophecy, came and licked it [1Ki 21:19].

The word rendered ‘at a venture’ is translated in other places, and on the margin of A.V. and R.V. ‘in his simplicity.’ It is also rendered ‘in his integrity’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-1.htm" title="Better is the poor that walks in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.">Proverbs 19:1</a>) and ‘in his uprightness’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-6.htm" title="Better is the poor that walks in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.">Proverbs 28:6</a>). The idea appears to be that the man taking aim at some one, was quite unaware at whom he was shooting. He levelled at some enemy and hit him, not knowing how he had contributed to the victory. ‘At a venture’ must therefore not be taken to mean ‘a shot at random.’ The LXX. <span class="greekheb">εὐστόχως</span> ‘with good aim’ is a conjecture.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">between the joints of the harness</span>] The margins of R.V. ‘between the lower armour and the breastplate’ and of A.V. ‘between the joints and the breastplate’ help us to understand what is meant. The former word, rendered ‘joints,’ indicates that part where the breastplate terminated and where the lower armour commenced. A part of the body would there necessarily be less securely protected.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot</span>] He would not wish to spread alarm among his soldiers, and so made his retreat without observation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I am wounded</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">sore wounded</span>. The literal rendering ‘made sick’ which is given on the margin of A.V. implies more than an ordinary wound. The translation ‘sore wounded’ is from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-23.htm" title="And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.">2 Chronicles 35:23</a> (A.V.). Perhaps Ahab employed the word, which might have a certain vagueness, that the charioteer should not spread an alarm. For the driver knew of course who it was whom he was carrying.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And a certain man</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">a man.</span> It was natural for some of the Rabbins to identify this archer with Naaman - the tradition is found in Josephus.

But it is clear that the rendering <span class="accented">joints</span>, notwithstanding that it has the support of Gesenius and others, is a mistaken one. "In the joints" we can understand, but "between the joints and the coat of mail," gives no sense. It is obvious that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> like <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span> following, must signify, some portion of the armour, and the  meaning of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span> <span class="accented">adhaesit</span>, leads us to conclude that "the hanging skirt of parallel metal plates - hence the plural" - (Bahr) is intended. The coat of mail only covered the breast and ribs. To this a fringe of movable plates of steel was <span class="accented">attached</span> or <span class="accented">fastened</span>, hence called <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. So Luther, <span class="accented">Zwischen den Panzer und Hengel</span>. One is reminded here of the Parthian arrow which wrung from Julian the Apostate the dying confession, "Thou hast conquered, O Galilean." Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13, 14</a>]: <span class="cmt_word">wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand</span> [or, according to the Chethib, <span class="accented">hands</span>. The charioteers of Palestine, like those of Egypt and Assyria, or those of modern Russia, held a rein in each hand. Same expression <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-23.htm">2 Kings 9:23</a>. The meaning is "turn round"] <span class="cmt_word">and carry me Out of the host; for I am wounded,</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">made sick</span>. The king probably felt his wound to be mortal, as a wound in such a part, the abdomen (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-23.htm">2 Samuel 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-10.htm">2 Samuel 20:10</a>), would be Vulgate, <span class="accented">graviter vulneratus sum</span>. How far an arrow in such a place could penetrate, we may gather from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-24.htm">2 Kings 9:24</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-13.htm">Job 16:13</a>. And he was seemingly anxious that the army should not know it, lest would soon discover it if he remained with the <span class="accented">host</span>; he can fight no longer; his wound needs attention; hence this command. It is quite possible that the charioteer, in the din and confusion of battle, may not have observed that his master was wounded.
