They will be drawn to wink at and countenance such conduct and conversation as they ought to protest against with abhorrence. Whithersoever a good man goes, he ought to take his religion with him, and not be ashamed to own it when he is with those who have no regard for it. Jehoshaphat had not left behind him, at Jerusalem, his affection and reverence for the word of the Lord, but avowed it, and endeavoured to bring it into Ahab's court. And Ahab's prophets, to please Jehoshaphat, made use of the name of Jehovah: to please Ahab, they said, Go up. But the false prophets cannot so mimic the true, but that he who has spiritual senses exercised, can discern the fallacy. One faithful prophet of the Lord was worth them all. Wordly men have in all ages been alike absurd in their views of religion. They would have the preacher fit his doctrine to the fashion of the times, and the taste of the hearers, and yet to add. Thus saith the Lord, to words that men would put into their mouths. They are ready to cry out against a man as rude and foolish, who scruples thus to try to secure his own interests, and to deceive others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The prophets - i. e., In all probability the prophets attached to the worship of the calves; not real prophets of Yahweh. This seems evident both from Jehoshaphat's dissatisfaction <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-7.htm">1 Kings 22:7</a>, and from the strong antagonism apparent between the true Yahweh-prophet Micaiah, and these self-styled "prophets of the Lord" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-22.htm">1 Kings 22:22-25</a>.<p>The Lord shall deliver it - In the Hebrew the word here used for "Lord" is &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;  'a&#780;dona&#772;y.

Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours&#8212;a Levitical and free town on the north border of Gad (De 4:43; Jos 21:38), on the site of the present Salt Lake, in the province of Belka. It lay within the territories of the Israelitish monarch, and was unjustly alienated; but whether it was one of the cities usurped by the first Ben-hadad, which his son had promised to restore, or was retained for some other reasons, the sacred historian has not mentioned. In the expedition which Ahab meditated for the recovery of this town, the aid of Jehoshaphat was asked and promised (see 2Ch 18:3). Previous to declaring hostilities, it was customary to consult the prophets (see on [325]1Sa 28:8); and Jehoshaphat having expressed a strong desire to know the Lord's will concerning this war, Ahab assembled four hundred of his prophets. These could not be either the prophets of Baal or of Ashteroth (1Ki 18:19), but seem (1Ki 22:12) to have been false prophets, who conformed to the symbolic calf-worship of Jehovah. Being the creatures of Ahab, they unanimously predicted a prosperous issue to the war. But dissatisfied with them, Jehoshaphat inquired if there was any true prophet of the Lord. Ahab agreed, with great reluctance, to allow Micaiah to be summoned. He was the only true prophet then to be found residing in Samaria, and he had to be brought out of prison (1Ki 22:26), into which, according to Josephus, he had been cast on account of his rebuke to Ahab for sparing the king of Syria.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The prophets</span> doubtless were his own false prophets, or the priests of Baal; probably those very four hundred men whom Jezebel preserved from that great slaughter, <span class="bld"> 1Ki 18</span>, who yet gave in their answer in the name of Jehovah, not of Baal; either in compliance with Jehoshaphat; or rather, by Ahab’s direction, that good Jehoshaphat might be deceived by them into a good opinion of the war. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men,....

But they were not true adherents of the Lord, otherwise Jehoshaphat would certainly have been content with their words. He went on with the project of the expedition even after Micaiah’s prophetic warning; he never would have sought for more satisfaction, had he heard four hundred true prophets of Jehovah say, ‘the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king.’ These men were therefore the prophets who served in the worship of the calves. They would use Jehovah’s name, just as constantly as the men who had not forsaken His commandment, and throughout the whole of Israel this number of them could no doubt be readily gathered, and these, though not his Baal-priests, Ahab would bring before Jehoshaphat.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Go up</span>] The land of Gilead was all mountainous.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Lord shall deliver</span> it] It is remarkable that in this first form of answer, the word for “Lord” is <span class="ital">Adonai</span>, not the word which we represent by <span class="ital">Jehovah</span>, and which is generally rendered Lord.

This word ‘Adonai’ is what the Jews use now instead of pronouncing the sacred name, but their reason could not have weighed with Ahab’s priests in Israel. In the parallel place in Chronicles ‘God’, <span class="ital">Elohim</span>, is used in the first answer, and ‘Jehovah’ in the others.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets</span> [Called by Micaiah "his prophets" (ver. 22), and "thy prophets" (ver. 23)] <span class="cmt_word">together, about four hundred men</span> [From the number (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19</a>) it has been concluded that these were "the prophets of the groves," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of Astarte, who escaped the massacre of the Baal prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-40.htm">1 Kings 18:40</a>). Others have supposed that they were prophets of Baal. But both these suppositions are negatived <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by the fact that Jehoshaphat asks Ahab to "inquire at the word of <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>," and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that these prophets profess to speak in the name and by the Spirit of Jehovah (vers. 11, 12, 24). Moreover <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Ahab would hardly have insulted Jehoshaphat by bringing the prophets of Baal or Astarte before him (Waterland in Wordsworth). And yet that they were not true prophets of the Lord, or of the" sons of the prophets," appears <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from ver. 7, where Jehoshaphat asks for a "prophet of the Lord;" and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from ver. 20 sqq., where Micaiah disclaims them, and is found in direct opposition to them. The only conclusion open to us, consequently - and it is now generally adopted - is that they were the priests of the high places of Bethel and Dan, the successors of those whom Jeroboam had introduced into the priestly office. It need cause us no surprise to find these priests here described as "prophets" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-1.htm">Ezekiel 13:1</a>), and as claiming prophetic gifts, for the priests of Baal bore the same name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19, 22</a>, etc.), and apparently pretended to similar powers. "No ancient people considered any cultus complete without a class of men through whom the god might be questioned" (Bahr). The existence of so large a number of prophets of the calves proves that the inroads of idolatry had by no means destroyed the calf worship.

It was probably this circumstance excited Jehoshaphat's suspicions. It has been said that the reason why he was dissatisfied with this answer is unexplained; but when we remember how careful the true prophet was to speak in the name of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-7.htm">1 Kings 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-13.htm">1 Kings 20:13, 14, 28</a>), we can hardly doubt that it was their mention of "Adonai "occasioned his misgivings.
