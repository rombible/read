A very bad character is given of him; he listened not to instruction, took no warning, but followed the example of his wicked father, and the counsel of his more wicked mother, Jezebel, who was still living. Miserable are the children who not only derive a sinful nature from their parents, but are taught by them to increase it; and most unhappy parents are they, that help to damn their children's souls. Hardened sinners rush forward, unawed and unmoved, in the ways from which others before them have been driven into everlasting misery.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the way of his mother - In this phrase, which does not occur anywhere else, we see the strong feeling of the writer as to the influence of Jezebel (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31</a>).<p>Verses <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-51.htm">1 Kings 22:51-53</a>.

The Syrian king, with a view either to put the speediest end to the war, or perhaps to wipe out the stain of his own humiliation (1Ki 20:31), had given special instructions to his generals to single out Ahab, and to take or kill him, as the author of the war. The officers at first directed their assault on Jehoshaphat, but, becoming aware of their mistake, desisted. Ahab was wounded by a random arrow, which, being probably poisoned, and the state of the weather increasing the virulence of the poison, he died at sunset. The corpse was conveyed to Samaria; and, as the chariot which brought it was being washed, in a pool near the city, from the blood that had profusely oozed from the wound, the dogs, in conformity with Elijah's prophecy, came and licked it [1Ki 21:19]. Ahab was succeeded by his son Ahaziah [1Ki 22:40].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Which clause seems here added, to show how little the authority and example of parents or ancestors is to be valued where it is opposed to the will and word of God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Which evil was idolatry: <p>and walked in the way of his father; his father Ahab, who worshipped Baal: <p>and in the way of his mother; his mother Jezebel, who was still living, and served Baal and Astarte, the deities of her country: <p>and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat; who set up and worshipped the golden calves: <p>who made Israel to sin; by the worship of the same, into which he drew them by his example and authority. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_kings/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">52</span>. <span class="ital">did evil</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">did that which was evil</span>] As often before.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the way of his mother</span>] i.e. He tried to put down the worship of Jehovah altogether, as Jezebel had done.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">who</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">wherein he</span>] <span class="ital">made Israel to sin</span>] On a similar change, cf. above <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-30.htm" title="And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that were before him.">1 Kings 16:30</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 52.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of his father</span> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-30.htm">1 Kings 16:30-33</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-2.htm">2 Kings 3:2</a>] <span class="cmt_word">and in the way of his mother</span> [The powerful influence of Jezebel, even after Ahab's death, is hinted at here.
