The visit of Jehoshaphat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-2.htm" title="And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead.">2Chronicles 18:2</a>) was one of festivity, of which Ahab took advantage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/22.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-2.htm" title="And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.">1 Kings 22:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">The king of Judah came down to the king of Israel — </span>Having now, as he supposed, made a firm peace with him, by the alliance contracted between Jehoram his son, and Athaliah, Ahab’s daughter, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-18.htm" title="And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.">2 Kings 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-1.htm" title="Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab.">2 Chronicles 18:1</a>. It is strange that so good a man would be so closely connected with a king revolted, from the worship of God! But he appears to have been of to easy a temper, which betrayed him to many inconveniences.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:1-14 The same easiness of temper, which betrays some godly persons into friendship with the declared enemies of religion, renders it very dangerous to them. They will be drawn to wink at and countenance such conduct and conversation as they ought to protest against with abhorrence. Whithersoever a good man goes, he ought to take his religion with him, and not be ashamed to own it when he is with those who have no regard for it. Jehoshaphat had not left behind him, at Jerusalem, his affection and reverence for the word of the Lord, but avowed it, and endeavoured to bring it into Ahab's court. And Ahab's prophets, to please Jehoshaphat, made use of the name of Jehovah: to please Ahab, they said, Go up. But the false prophets cannot so mimic the true, but that he who has spiritual senses exercised, can discern the fallacy. One faithful prophet of the Lord was worth them all. Wordly men have in all ages been alike absurd in their views of religion. They would have the preacher fit his doctrine to the fashion of the times, and the taste of the hearers, and yet to add. Thus saith the Lord, to words that men would put into their mouths. They are ready to cry out against a man as rude and foolish, who scruples thus to try to secure his own interests, and to deceive others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This visit indicates an entire change in the relations which we have hitherto found subsisting between the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. The common danger to which the two kingdoms were exposed from the growing power of Syria had probably induced them to forget their differences. Jehoshaphat's eldest son, Jehoram, was married to Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab: but apparently the bond between the two families had not hitherto led to any very close intimacy, much less to any joint military expeditions. Jehoshaphat seems to have taken no part in the former Syrian wars of Ahab, nor did he join in the great league against the Assyrians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-1.htm">1 Kings 22:1</a> note). His visit now was probably one of mere friendliness, without any political object. Ahab, however, turned the visit to political advantage. From this time until the displacement of Ahab's dynasty by Jehu, very intimate relations subsisted between the two kingdoms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-49.htm">1 Kings 22:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-7.htm">2 Kings 3:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-28.htm">2 Kings 8:28-29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-36.htm">2 Chronicles 20:36</a>, etc.). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel&#8212;It was singular that a friendly league between the sovereigns of Israel and Judah should, for the first time, have been formed by princes of such opposite characters&#8212;the one pious, the other wicked. Neither this league nor the matrimonial alliance by which the union of the royal families was more closely cemented, met the Lord's approval (2Ch 19:2). It led, however, to a visit by Jehoshaphat, whose reception in Samaria was distinguished by the most lavish hospitality (2Ch 18:2). The opportunity of this visit was taken advantage of, to push an object on which Ahab's heart was much set.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Having now, as he supposed, made a firm peace with Ahab by the alliance contracted between Jehoram his son, and Athaliah, Ahab’s daughter; of which see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-18.htm" title="And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.">2 Kings 8:18</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-1.htm" title="Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab.">2 Chronicles 18:1</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass in the third year,....

Jehoram, Jehoshaphat’s son had married Ahab’s daughter, Athaliah. And after this event the king of Judah paid his visit to Samaria. The reception is described in Chronicles as a scene of great profusion, and Josephus speaks of troops (<span class="greekheb">στρατὸς</span>) which accompanied Jehoshaphat. Probably the subject of the war against Syria had been discussed before the meeting of the two kings.
