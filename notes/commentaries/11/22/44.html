The Syrian king, with a view either to put the speediest end to the war, or perhaps to wipe out the stain of his own humiliation (1Ki 20:31), had given special instructions to his generals to single out Ahab, and to take or kill him, as the author of the war. The officers at first directed their assault on Jehoshaphat, but, becoming aware of their mistake, desisted. Ahab was wounded by a random arrow, which, being probably poisoned, and the state of the weather increasing the virulence of the poison, he died at sunset. The corpse was conveyed to Samaria; and, as the chariot which brought it was being washed, in a pool near the city, from the blood that had profusely oozed from the wound, the dogs, in conformity with Elijah's prophecy, came and licked it [1Ki 21:19]. Ahab was succeeded by his son Ahaziah [1Ki 22:40].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> With Ahab first, and then with his son.

Judah now recognized the division of the kingdom as an accomplished fact, and no longer treated Israel, even theoretically, as in rebellion. It is probable that the marriage of Jehoram and Athaliah was at once the fruit of, and was intended to cement, this good understanding (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-1.htm">2 Chronicles 18:1</a>). It is hardly likely (Bahr) that the peace was the result of the union of the two families. From the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-37.htm">2 Chronicles 20:37</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-14.htm">2 Kings 3:14</a>, we should conclude that the marriage at any rate was ill advised and displeasing to God. Bahr sees in it a step on the part of Jehoshaphat towards realizing the union of the two kingdoms under the supremacy of Judah. He thinks that we cannot otherwise account for this complete change of front.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When they washed the chariot at the pool of Samaria, the dogs licked his blood, while the harlots were bathing (in the pool). &#1493;&#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1512;&#1495;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468; is a circumstantial clause, and &#1512;&#1495;&#1509; means to bathe, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-5.htm">Exodus 2:5</a>. This explanation, which is sustained by the grammar and is the only tenable one, disposes of the several arbitrary interpretations of these words, together with the emendations of the text of which Thenius is so fond. In this way was the word of the Lord through Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>) and the unknown prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-42.htm">1 Kings 20:42</a>) fulfilled; also the prediction of Micah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-17.htm">1 Kings 22:17</a>). Ahab had paid the penalty with his own life for sparing the life of Benhadad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-42.htm">1 Kings 20:42</a>), and his blood was licked up by the dogs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>). The fact that the dogs licked up the blood and the harlots were bathing in the pool, when the chariot that was stained with the blood of Ahab was being washed, is mentioned as a sign of the ignominious contempt which was heaped upon him at his death.</body></html>
