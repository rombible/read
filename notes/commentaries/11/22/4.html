It must be remembered that, as the whole chapter shows, Ahab had now returned to the worship of the Lord.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/22.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-4.htm" title="And he said to Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to battle to Ramothgilead?

Even bad men have often coveted the friendship of the good; but it is strange that Jehoshaphat should go so entirely into Ahab’s interests as to say, <span class="ital">I am as thou art, and my people as thy people — </span>That is, I will heartily and effectually join with thee; and my forces shall be at thy service, as much as thine own. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:1-14 The same easiness of temper, which betrays some godly persons into friendship with the declared enemies of religion, renders it very dangerous to them. They will be drawn to wink at and countenance such conduct and conversation as they ought to protest against with abhorrence. Whithersoever a good man goes, he ought to take his religion with him, and not be ashamed to own it when he is with those who have no regard for it. Jehoshaphat had not left behind him, at Jerusalem, his affection and reverence for the word of the Lord, but avowed it, and endeavoured to bring it into Ahab's court. And Ahab's prophets, to please Jehoshaphat, made use of the name of Jehovah: to please Ahab, they said, Go up. But the false prophets cannot so mimic the true, but that he who has spiritual senses exercised, can discern the fallacy. One faithful prophet of the Lord was worth them all. Wordly men have in all ages been alike absurd in their views of religion. They would have the preacher fit his doctrine to the fashion of the times, and the taste of the hearers, and yet to add. Thus saith the Lord, to words that men would put into their mouths. They are ready to cry out against a man as rude and foolish, who scruples thus to try to secure his own interests, and to deceive others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ahab, well aware of the military strength of Syria, and feeling that he cannot now expect divine aid <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-42.htm">1 Kings 20:42</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21</a>, asks the aid of Jehoshaphat, whose military resources were very great <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-12.htm">2 Chronicles 17:12-19</a>. Jehoshaphat's answer is one of complete acquiescence, without reserve of any kind (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-3.htm">2 Chronicles 18:3</a>). Jehoshaphat was afterward rebuked for thus consenting to "help the ungodly" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>. He probably acted not merely from complaisance, but from a belief that the interests of his own kingdom would be advanced by the step which he agreed to take. The power of Syria was at this time very menacing. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3-8. Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours&#8212;a Levitical and free town on the north border of Gad (De 4:43; Jos 21:38), on the site of the present Salt Lake, in the province of Belka. It lay within the territories of the Israelitish monarch, and was unjustly alienated; but whether it was one of the cities usurped by the first Ben-hadad, which his son had promised to restore, or was retained for some other reasons, the sacred historian has not mentioned. In the expedition which Ahab meditated for the recovery of this town, the aid of Jehoshaphat was asked and promised (see 2Ch 18:3). Previous to declaring hostilities, it was customary to consult the prophets (see on [325]1Sa 28:8); and Jehoshaphat having expressed a strong desire to know the Lord's will concerning this war, Ahab assembled four hundred of his prophets. These could not be either the prophets of Baal or of Ashteroth (1Ki 18:19), but seem (1Ki 22:12) to have been false prophets, who conformed to the symbolic calf-worship of Jehovah. Being the creatures of Ahab, they unanimously predicted a prosperous issue to the war. But dissatisfied with them, Jehoshaphat inquired if there was any true prophet of the Lord. Ahab agreed, with great reluctance, to allow Micaiah to be summoned. He was the only true prophet then to be found residing in Samaria, and he had to be brought out of prison (1Ki 22:26), into which, according to Josephus, he had been cast on account of his rebuke to Ahab for sparing the king of Syria.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I will heartily and effectually join with thee, and my forces shall be at thy service, as much as thy own. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>This affair being lately canvassed at the council board, and very much on Ahab's mind, he puts this question to Jehoshaphat, his visitor, relation, and ally; wisely considering that his own forces were small, and that to have such an auxiliary might be of great advantage to him: <p>and Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses; meaning, that he and his soldiers, foot and horse, were at his service. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead?

Such an alliance was altogether new, and Ahab might well wonder how the idea would strike a pious prince like Jehoshaphat.

Probably Ben-hadad, when he besieged Samaria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-1.htm">1 Kings 20:1</a>), had formed the idea of reducing the whole of Palestine to subjection. And Jehoshaphat would remember that Ramoth-Gilead, where the Syrian king was still  entrenched, was but forty miles distant from Jerusalem. Bahr holds that horses are specially mentioned "because they formed an essential part of the military power" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>). It is true that in a campaign against the Syrians they would be especially useful (see on 1 Kings 20:1.); but they receive no mention at the hands of the chronicler, who reads instead of this last clause, "And we (or I) will be with thee in the war."] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This terrible threat made such an impression upon Ahab, that he felt deep remorse, and for a time at least was sincerely penitent. Rending the clothes, putting on the mourning garment of hair (&#1513;&#1474;&#1511;), and fasting, are frequently mentioned as external signs of humiliation before God or of deep mourning on account of sin. &#1497;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; &#1488;&#1496;, he walked about lightly (slowly), like one in deep trouble. This repentance was neither hypocritical, nor purely external; but it was sincere even if it was not lasting and produced no real conversion. For the Lord Himself acknowledge it to be humiliation before Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-29.htm">1 Kings 21:29</a>), and said to Elijah, that because of it He would not bring the threatened calamity upon Ahab's house in his own lifetime, but only in the days of his son. &#1488;&#1489;&#1497; for &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21</a>. </body></html>
