Ahaziah had thus an interest in the ships; and when they were wrecked, attributing, as it would seem, the calamity to the unskillfulness of his ally's mariners, he proposed that the fleet should be manned in part by Israelite sailors - men probably accustomed to the sea, perhaps trained at Tyre. This proposal Jehoshaphat refused, either offended at the reflection on his subjects' skill, or accepting the wreck of the ships, which Eliezer had prophesied, as a proof that God was against the entire undertaking. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29-38. went up to Ramoth-gilead&#8212;The king of Israel, bent on this expedition, marched, accompanied by his ally, with all his forces to the siege; but on approaching the scene of action, his courage failed, and, hoping to evade the force of Micaiah's prophecy by a secret stratagem, he assumed the uniform of a subaltern, while he advised Jehoshaphat to fight in his royal attire. The Syrian king, with a view either to put the speediest end to the war, or perhaps to wipe out the stain of his own humiliation (1Ki 20:31), had given special instructions to his generals to single out Ahab, and to take or kill him, as the author of the war. The officers at first directed their assault on Jehoshaphat, but, becoming aware of their mistake, desisted. Ahab was wounded by a random arrow, which, being probably poisoned, and the state of the weather increasing the virulence of the poison, he died at sunset. The corpse was conveyed to Samaria; and, as the chariot which brought it was being washed, in a pool near the city, from the blood that had profusely oozed from the wound, the dogs, in conformity with Elijah's prophecy, came and licked it [1Ki 21:19]. Ahab was succeeded by his son Ahaziah [1Ki 22:40].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Object.</span> It is said that he did join with Ahaziah herein, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-35.htm" title="And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:">2 Chronicles 20:35</a>,36</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> That was before this time, and before the ships were broken; for the breaking of the ships, mentioned here, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm" title="Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.">1 Kings 22:48</a></span>, is noted to be the effect of his sin, in joining with Ahaziah, and of the prophecy consequent upon it, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-37.htm" title="Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because you have joined yourself with Ahaziah, the LORD has broken your works.

The explanation is that the fleet had been built by the two kings conjointly, and manned by the subjects of Jehoshaphat exclusively; and that, after the disaster, Ahaziah proposed either to repair the injured vessels, or to construct a second fleet, which should then be partly manned by sailors of the northern kingdom, "men probably accustomed to the sea, perhaps trained at Tyre" (Rawlinson). This proposal was declined by the king of Judah, not so much on account of the "reflection on his subjects' skill contained in it," as because of the prophecy of Eliezer, and the evidently judicial disaster which had befallen the fleet already built.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"He walked entirely in the way of his father Asa and departed not from it, to do what was well-pleasing to the Lord," whereas Asa's heart had become more estranged from the Lord in the last years of his reign (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>.). - On the worship of the high places (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-43.htm">1 Kings 22:43</a>), see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-14.htm">1 Kings 15:14</a>.</body></html>
