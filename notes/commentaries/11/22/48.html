The fleet was a combined fleet of Judah and Israel, built at Ezion-geber, which belonged to Judah; the alliance was denounced and judgment threatened by the prophet Eliezer. After the wreck of the fleet, manned, it would seem, by the subjects of Jehoshaphat, Ahaziah of Israel desires to renew the enterprise with the aid of Israelite and probably Tyrian sailors; but Jehoshaphat now refuses.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/22.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm" title="Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.">1 Kings 22:48</a></span>. <span class="ital">Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish </span>— These ships were not to go to Tharshish, but Ophir.

Compare the use of "India-man" for a vessel of a certain class. Jehoshaphat's fleet was constructed at Ezion-Gaber, on the Red Sea <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-36.htm">2 Chronicles 20:36</a>, where Solomon had previously built a navy <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>.

The Syrian king, with a view either to put the speediest end to the war, or perhaps to wipe out the stain of his own humiliation (1Ki 20:31), had given special instructions to his generals to single out Ahab, and to take or kill him, as the author of the war. The officers at first directed their assault on Jehoshaphat, but, becoming aware of their mistake, desisted. Ahab was wounded by a random arrow, which, being probably poisoned, and the state of the weather increasing the virulence of the poison, he died at sunset. The corpse was conveyed to Samaria; and, as the chariot which brought it was being washed, in a pool near the city, from the blood that had profusely oozed from the wound, the dogs, in conformity with Elijah's prophecy, came and licked it [1Ki 21:19]. Ahab was succeeded by his son Ahaziah [1Ki 22:40].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> See <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-36.htm" title="And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Eziongaber.">2 Chronicles 20:36</a></span>.
