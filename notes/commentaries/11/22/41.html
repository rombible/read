In the Chronicles, on the contrary, there is a full and interesting account of the reign of Jehoshaphat, and especially of his great religious revival (2 Chronicles 17-20), coinciding with this chapter, almost verbally, in the account of the battle at Ramoth-gilead. The brief notices here of the religious work of Jehoshaphat, his <span class= "ital">“</span>might,” and his “wars,” agree entirely with this fuller record.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:41-50 Jehoshaphat's reign appears to have been one of the best, both as to piety and prosperity.

The Syrian king, with a view either to put the speediest end to the war, or perhaps to wipe out the stain of his own humiliation (1Ki 20:31), had given special instructions to his generals to single out Ahab, and to take or kill him, as the author of the war. The officers at first directed their assault on Jehoshaphat, but, becoming aware of their mistake, desisted. Ahab was wounded by a random arrow, which, being probably poisoned, and the state of the weather increasing the virulence of the poison, he died at sunset. The corpse was conveyed to Samaria; and, as the chariot which brought it was being washed, in a pool near the city, from the blood that had profusely oozed from the wound, the dogs, in conformity with Elijah's prophecy, came and licked it [1Ki 21:19]. Ahab was succeeded by his son Ahaziah [1Ki 22:40].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Who reigned twenty-two years; therefore he reigned about eighteen years with Ahab. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.

His alliance with Jehoram, Ahab’s son, against the king of Moab, is mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-7.htm" title="And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.">2 Kings 2:7</a>, seqq.) and that Jehoram, his son, was made king during his father’s lifetime (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-16.htm" title="And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Je hoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.">2 Kings 8:16</a>). But this is all. Yet clearly Jehoshaphat was a king of much influence. The Chronicler also tells much good concerning him. The Lord was with him (2 Chronicles 17) and he prospered. He sent out Levites with the princes to teach the people in the cities of Judah. His enemies were dismayed by his greatness, for he had famous commanders and mighty armies. He made the improper alliance with Ahab (2 Chronicles 18) but after Ahab’s death, he returned to Jerusalem and appointed and instructed judges and priests and Levites (2 Chronicles 19) to act in the fear of the Lord and with a perfect heart. He was attacked by Moab (2 Chronicles 20) but seeking unto the Lord he gained a great victory, which he celebrated in such way that the place of the celebration was known afterwards as ‘The valley of blessing.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoahaphat</span> ["Whom Jehovah judges"] <span class="cmt_word">the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.</span> [The historian now resumes for a moment the history of Judah, which has dropped out of notice since <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-24.htm">1 Kings 15:24</a>, where the accession of Jehoshaphat was mentioned.
