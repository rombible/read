The Syrian king, with a view either to put the speediest end to the war, or perhaps to wipe out the stain of his own humiliation (1Ki 20:31), had given special instructions to his generals to single out Ahab, and to take or kill him, as the author of the war. The officers at first directed their assault on Jehoshaphat, but, becoming aware of their mistake, desisted. Ahab was wounded by a random arrow, which, being probably poisoned, and the state of the weather increasing the virulence of the poison, he died at sunset. The corpse was conveyed to Samaria; and, as the chariot which brought it was being washed, in a pool near the city, from the blood that had profusely oozed from the wound, the dogs, in conformity with Elijah's prophecy, came and licked it [1Ki 21:19]. Ahab was succeeded by his son Ahaziah [1Ki 22:40].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He reigned twenty and five years; </span> part by himself and partly with his sons, whom he took into the fellowship of his kingdom; of which see more on <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-17.htm" title="So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken.

For it was in the fourth year of Ahab that Jehoshaphat began to reign. Ahab reigned 22 years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-29.htm" title="And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.">1 Kings 16:29</a>).

Ahaziah reigned two years (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-51.htm" title="Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.">1 Kings 22:51</a> below) and it was in the 5th year of Joram, the brother and successor of Ahaziah, that Jehoshaphat joined his son with him in the kingdom.
