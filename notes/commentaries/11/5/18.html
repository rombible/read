This marginal translation also must yield to another which has lately been proposed, by a slight change in the Hebrew text, and which would be rendered thus: "Solomon's builders, and Hiram's builders, did hew them and bevel them" [Thenius]. These great bevelled or grooved stones, measuring some twenty, others thirty feet in length, and from five to six feet in breadth, are still seen in the substructures about the ancient site of the temple; and, in the judgment of the most competent observers, were those originally employed "to lay the foundation of the house."   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The stone-squarers, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">the Gibites</span>; the inhabitants of Gebel, a place near Zidon, named <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-7.htm" title="Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;">Psalm 83:7</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-9.htm" title="The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in you your caulkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in you to occupy your merchandise.">Ezekiel 27:9</a></span>, famous for artificers and architects, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-5.htm" title="And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sun rise, from Baalgad under mount Hermon to the entering into Hamath.">Joshua 13:5</a></span>.

But the margin of A. V. suggests that the word is not a common but a proper noun and gives ‘Giblites’ as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-9.htm" title="The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in you your caulkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in you to occupy your merchandise.">Ezekiel 27:9</a>. This is certainly a much more natural combination, than to class along with the men of Solomon and the men of Hiram, the stone squarers as of a different order. In Ezekiel the men of Gebal are spoken of as skilled in caulking ships, and they were not improbably able handicraftsmen in other branches. Josephus gives us no help. He speaks merely of ‘workmen whom Hiram sent.’ But the Vulgate reads ‘Giblii’ as a proper name and in many MSS. <span class="ital">Biblii</span> or <span class="ital">Byblii</span>. In the Vatican LXX. the verse is left out, but the Alexandrine gives <span class="greekheb">καὶ οἱ Βίβλιοι</span>. Now Gebal was a Phœnician city not far from the sea coast, to the north of Berytus (<span class="ital">Beyrout</span>). The Greeks called it Byblos, but the name is found also spelt <span class="greekheb">Βίβλος</span> (Zosim. i. 58; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-9.htm" title="The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in you your caulkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in you to occupy your merchandise.">Ezekiel 27:9</a>. LXX.). Thus the LXX. supports the proper name, which, to keep clear that it means the people of Gebal, we ought to write <span class="bld">‘the Gebalites.’</span> This has been adopted by R.V.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stone squarers:</span> [the marg. <span class="accented">Giblites, i.e.</span>, people of Gebal, is to be preferred. For Gebal (  =  mountain) see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a> ("the land of the Giblites and Lebanon"); <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-7.htm">Psalm 83:7</a> ("Gebal and they of Tyro"); and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-9.htm">Ezekiel 27:9</a>, where the LXX. translate the word <span class="accented">Biblus</span>, which was the Greek name of the city and district north of the famous river <span class="accented">Adonis</span>, on the extreme border of Phoenicia. It is now known as <span class="accented">Jebeil.</span> It has been already remarked that Tyre and Sidon, as well as Gebal, have Hebrew meanings. These are among the proofs of the practical  identity of the Hebrew and Phoenician tongues. The Aramaean immigrants (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-5.htm">Deuteronomy 26:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-5.htm">Genesis 12:5</a>) no doubt adopted the language of Canaan (Dict. Bib., art. "Phoenicians"). Keil renders, <span class="accented">"even</span> the Giblites." He would understand, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that the Zidonian workmen were Giblites; but this is doubtful. The Giblites are selected, no doubt, for special mention because of the prominent part they took in the work. Gebal, as its ancient and extensive ruins prove, was a place of much importance, and lying as it did on the coast, and near the cedar forests, would naturally have an important share in the cutting and shipping of the timber. Indeed, it is not improbable that it was at this port that the land transport ended, and the rafts were made. A road ran anciently from Gebal to Baalbak, so that the transport was not impracticable. But as the forests were probably of great extent, there may have been two or three depots at which the timber was floated] so they prepared timber [Heb. <span class="accented">the timber</span>] and stones [Heb. <span class="accented">the stones</span>] to build the house. [The LXX. (Vat. and Alex. alike) add here, "<span class="accented">three</span> <span class="accented">years."</span> It is barely possible that these words may have dropped out of the text, but they look more like a gloss, the inference from the chronological statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a>.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The remark that "the Lord gave Solomon wisdom" refers not merely to the treaty which Solomon made with Hiram, through which he obtained materials and skilled workmen for the erection of the house of God (Thenius), but also to the wise use which he made of the capacities of his own subjects for this work. For this verse not only brings to a close the section relating to Solomon's negotiations with Hiram, but it also forms an introduction to the following verses, in which the intimation given by Solomon in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>, concerning the labourers who were to fell wood upon Lebanon in company with Hiram's men, is more minutely defined. </body></html>
