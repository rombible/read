There is no adversary, no Satan, so the word is; no instrument of Satan to oppose it, or to divert from it. Satan does all he can, to hinder temple work. When there is no evil abroad, then let us be ready and active in that which is good, and get forward. Let God's promises quicken our endeavours. And all outward skill and advantages should be made serviceable to the interests of Christ's kingdom. It Tyre supplies Israel with craftsmen, Israel will supply Tyre with corn, Eze 27:17.

Hiram Sends to Congratulate Solomon.<p>1. Hiram &#8230; sent his servants unto Solomon&#8212;the grandson of David's contemporary [Kitto]; or the same Hiram [Winer and others]. The friendly relations which the king of Tyre had cultivated with David are here seen renewed with his son and successor, by a message of condolence as well as of congratulation on his accession to the throne of Israel. The alliance between the two nations had been mutually beneficial by the encouragement of useful traffic. Israel, being agricultural, furnished corn and oil, while the Tyrians, who were a commercial people, gave in exchange their Phœnician manufactures, as well as the produce of foreign lands. A special treaty was now entered into in furtherance of that undertaking which was the great work of Solomon's splendid and peaceful reign.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou knowest, </span> by common fame, and by particular information. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Could not build an house unto the name of the Lord his God, </span> i.e. either, first, For the worship and service of God, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-2.htm" title="Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built to the name of the LORD, until those days.">1 Kings 3:2</a></span>.

Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-4.htm" title="Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.">1 Chronicles 22:4</a> where we are told that the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David. The reason why David himself did not begin to build the temple may also have been known to the northern king.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">could not build a house</span>] He was forbidden to do this by the word of the Lord (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-8.htm" title="But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, You have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars: you shall not build an house to my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.">1 Chronicles 22:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-3.htm" title="But God said to me, You shall not build an house for my name, because you have been a man of war, and have shed blood.">1 Chronicles 28:3</a>) because he had shed blood abundantly and made great wars.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto the name of the Lord</span>] See above on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-2.htm" title="Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built to the name of the LORD, until those days.">1 Kings 3:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for the wars which were about him</span>] The concord in this clause is not strictly grammatical, the noun rendered ‘wars’ being singular while the verb which follows is plural. It has therefore been proposed to render ‘because of the war wherewith they (i.e. his enemies) surrounded him.’ It seems better however to consider the singular noun as equivalent to a plural = <span class="ital">enemies</span>. And thus the rendering of the A. V. gives the correct sense. Another solution proposed has been to consider the words ‘men of’ as fallen out before ‘war,’ thus making the sense ‘because of the men of war who encompassed him.’ But such emendation of the text has no support in the versions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">put them under the soles of his feet</span>] A phrase not uncommon to denote entire conquest.

These four persons are most probably the same as the "sons of Zerach" (Ethan, Heman, Calcol, and Dara) mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-6.htm">1 Chronicles 2:6</a>, since the names perfectly agree, with the exception of &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506; for &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1506;, where the difference is no doubt attributable to a copyist's error; although, as the name does not occur again, it cannot be decided whether Dara or Darda is the correct form. Heman and Ethan are also called Ezrachites (&#1492;&#1488;&#1494;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497;) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-1.htm">Psalm 88:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-1.htm">Psalm 89:1</a>; and &#1488;&#1494;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497; is another form of &#1494;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497;, the name of the family of Zerach the son of Judah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/26-13.htm">Numbers 26:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-20.htm">Numbers 26:20</a>), lengthened by &#1488; prosthet. But they were both Levites - Heman a Korahite of the line of Kohath and a grandson of Samuel (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-18.htm">1 Chronicles 6:18-19</a>), and Ethan a Merarite (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-29.htm">1 Chronicles 6:29-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-17.htm">1 Chronicles 15:17</a>) and the president of the Levitical vocal choirs in the time of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-19.htm">1 Chronicles 15:19</a>); and Heman was also "the king's seer in the words of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-5.htm">1 Chronicles 25:5</a>). Their Levitical descent is not at variance with the epithet Ezrachite. For as the Levite in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-7.htm">Judges 17:7</a> is spoken of as belonging to the family of Judah, because he dwelt in Bethlehem of Judah, and as Samuel's father, Elkanah the Levite, is called an Ephraimite in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>, because in his civil capacity he was incorporated into the tribe of Ephraim, so Heman and Ethan are called Ezrachites because they were incorporated into the Judaean family of Zerach. It by no means follows from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-6.htm">1 Chronicles 2:6</a> that they were lineal descendants of Zerach. The whole character of the genealogical fragment contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-6.htm">1 Chronicles 2:6</a>. shows very clearly that it does not give the lineal posterity of Zerach with genealogical exactness, but that certain persons and households of that family who had gained historical renown are grouped together without any more precise account of their lineal descent. Calcol and Darda (or Dara) are never met with again. It is no doubt to these two that the expression &#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; refers, though it cannot be determined whether &#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500; is a proper name or an appellative noun. In support of the appellative meaning, "sons of the dance," in the sense of sacras choreas ducendi periti, Hiller (in the Onomast. p. 872) appeals to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:4</a>, "daughters of song." - "And his name was," i.e., he was celebrated, "among all the nations round about" (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-1.htm">1 Kings 10:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-23.htm">1 Kings 10:23-24</a>).</body></html>
