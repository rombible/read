There is no adversary, no Satan, so the word is; no instrument of Satan to oppose it, or to divert from it. Satan does all he can, to hinder temple work. When there is no evil abroad, then let us be ready and active in that which is good, and get forward. Let God's promises quicken our endeavours. And all outward skill and advantages should be made serviceable to the interests of Christ's kingdom. It Tyre supplies Israel with craftsmen, Israel will supply Tyre with corn, Eze 27:17. Thus, by the wise disposal of Providence, one country has need of another, and is benefitted by another, that there may be dependence on one another, to the glory of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As the Lord spake - See the marginal references <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13</a>, and compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-10.htm">1 Chronicles 22:10</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 5<p>1Ki 5:1-6. Hiram Sends to Congratulate Solomon.<p>1. Hiram &#8230; sent his servants unto Solomon&#8212;the grandson of David's contemporary [Kitto]; or the same Hiram [Winer and others]. The friendly relations which the king of Tyre had cultivated with David are here seen renewed with his son and successor, by a message of condolence as well as of congratulation on his accession to the throne of Israel. The alliance between the two nations had been mutually beneficial by the encouragement of useful traffic. Israel, being agricultural, furnished corn and oil, while the Tyrians, who were a commercial people, gave in exchange their Phœnician manufactures, as well as the produce of foreign lands. A special treaty was now entered into in furtherance of that undertaking which was the great work of Solomon's splendid and peaceful reign.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the Lord my God,....

It should be noticed that between the narrative in Kings and Chronicles there is a marked difference here. The former says nothing about the preparations which David had made for building the Temple, but makes the preparation commence under Solomon. In Chronicles David is represented as making great preparations before his death.

The cedar and hyssop are placed in antithesis, the former as the largest and most glorious of trees, the latter as the smallest and most insignificant of plants, to embrace the whole of the vegetable kingdom. Thenius maintains that by &#1488;&#1494;&#1493;&#1489; we are not to understand the true hyssop, nor the Wohlgemuth or Dosten (&#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), according to the ordinary view (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-22.htm">Exodus 12:22</a>), because they are neither of them such small plants as we should expect in an antithesis to the cedar, but "one of the wall-mosses growing in tufts, more especially the orthotrichum saxatile (Oken), which forms a miniature hyssop with its lancet-shaped leaves, and from its extreme minuteness furnishes a perfect antithesis to the cedar." There is much to favour this view, since we can easily imagine that the Hebrews may have reckoned a moss, which resembled the hyssop in its leaves, as being itself a species of hyssop. -  "And of beasts and birds, of creeping things and fishes;" the four principal classes into which the Hebrews divided the animal kingdom. Speaking of plants and animals presupposes observations and researches in natural science, or botanical and zoological studies.</body></html>
