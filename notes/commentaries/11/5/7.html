And all outward skill and advantages should be made serviceable to the interests of Christ's kingdom. It Tyre supplies Israel with craftsmen, Israel will supply Tyre with corn, Eze 27:17.

Still there is no doubt that the real Lebanon cedar is most commonly intended by it. This tree, which still grows on parts of the mountain, but which threatens to die out, was probably much more widely spread anciently. The Tyrians made the masts of their ships from the wood <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-5.htm">Ezekiel 27:5</a>, and would naturally be as careful to cultivate it as we have ourselves been to grow oak. The Assyrian kings, when they made their expeditions into Palestine, appear frequently to have cut it in Lebanon and Hermon, and to have transported it to their own capitals.<p>Skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians - The mechanical genius and nautical skill of the Phoenicians generally, and of the Sidonians in particular, is noticed by Homer and Herodotus. In the reign of Hiram, Sidon, though perhaps she might have a king of her own, acknowledged the supremacy of Tyre. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ki 5:7-12.

Blessed be the Lord&#8212;This language is no decisive evidence that Hiram was a worshipper of the true God, as he might use it only on the polytheistic principle of acknowledging Jehovah as the God of the Hebrews (see on [295]2Ch 2:11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He rejoiced greatly; </span> being an ingenuous prince, a lover of excellency, and a faithful friend to David and to his house. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Blessed be the Lord; </span> for though it be not probable that he was a sincere proselyte, because he did not endeavour the instruction of his people, and the extirpation of their gross idolatry, which by God’s blessing and Solomen’s help he might easily have effected; yet he had sufficient information concerning the nature and excellency of the God of Israel, and had honourable thoughts of him, as also divers other heathens had, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-8.htm" title="Woe to us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.">1 Samuel 4:8</a></span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-16.htm" title="Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions.

Cf. the queen of Sheba’s words of the same kind in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-9.htm" title="Blessed be the LORD your God, which delighted in you, to set you on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he you king, to do judgment and justice.">1 Kings 10:9</a>. In the words of Hiram as given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-12.htm" title="Wisdom and knowledge is granted to you; and I will give you riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had that have been before you, neither shall there any after you have the like.">2 Chronicles 1:12</a>, Jehovah is said to be the Maker of heaven and earth. If this were really Hiram’s language he must have identified Jehovah with his own supreme divinity. Of course it was no difficulty for a heathen to add the name of another divinity to his list of gods. Melchizedek (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-19.htm" title="And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:">Genesis 14:19</a>) speaks of ‘God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth’; and though not a heathen, he was outside the chosen race.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And It came to pass, when Hiram</span> <span class="cmt_word">heard the words of Solomon</span> [reported by his ambassadors], <span class="cmt_word">that he rejoiced greatly</span> [see note on ver. 1.

We are not warranted by the expression of the text in concluding that Hiram believed in the exclusive divinity of the God of Israel, or "identified Jehovah with Melkarth his god" (Rawlinson), much less that he was  proselyte to the faith of David and Solomon. All that is certain is that he believed the Jehovah as God was quite compatible with the retention of a firm faith in Baa1 and Astarte. It is also possible that he here adopts a language which he knew would be acceptable to Solomon, or the historian may have given us his thoughts in a Hebrew dread It is noticeable that the LXX. has simply <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>] <span class="cmt_word">which hath given unto David a wise son</span> [Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-48.htm">1 Kings 1:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-9.htm">1 Kings 2:9</a>. The proof of wisdom lay in Solomon's fulfilling his wise father's purposes, and in his care for the worship of God. "Wise," however, is not used here in the sense of "pious," as Bahr affirms. In Hiram's lips the word meant discreet, sagacious. He would hardly recognize the fear of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom] <span class="cmt_word">over this great people.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Solomon's negotiations with Hiram of Tyre. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-1.htm">1 Kings 5:1</a>. When king Hiram of Tyre heard that Solomon had been anointed king in the place of David, he sent his servants, i.e., an embassage, to Solomon, to congratulate him (as the Syriac correctly explains) on his ascent of the throne, because he had been a friend of David the whole time (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., as long as both of them David and Hiram were kings). On Hiram and the length of his reign, see the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11</a>. This is passed over in the Chronicles as having no essential bearing upon the building of the temple.</body></html>
