If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:">2Samuel 7:14-16</a>, that sin in the house of David should bring with it severe chastisement, but not final rejection. In estimating the “sin of Jeroboam,” the existence of this promise of security and blessing to his kingdom must be always taken into consideration.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:26-40 In telling the reason why God rent the kingdom from the house of Solomon, Ahijah warned Jeroboam to take heed of sinning away his preferment. Yet the house of David must be supported; out of it the Messiah would arise. Solomon sought to kill his successor. Had not he taught others, that whatever devices are in men's hearts, the counsel of the Lord shall stand? Yet he himself thinks to defeat that counsel. Jeroboam withdrew into Egypt, and was content to live in exile and obscurity for awhile, being sure of a kingdom at last. Shall not we be content, who have a better kingdom in reserve?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The first instance of the "acted parable."

A connection may be traced between the type selected and the words of the announcement to Solomon (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11-13</a>.

The meaning is, "Ahijah, the Shilonite, the prophet, went and took a fit station in the way; and, in order that he might not be known, he wrapped himself up, so as closely to conceal himself, in a new garment, a surtout, which he afterwards tore in twelve pieces." Notwithstanding this privacy, the story, and the prediction connected with it [1Ki 11:30-39], probably reached the king's ears; and Jeroboam became a marked man [1Ki 11:40]. His aspiring ambition, impatient for the death of Solomon, led him to form plots and conspiracies, in consequence of which he was compelled to flee to Egypt. Though chosen of God, he would not wait the course of God's providence, and therefore incurred the penalty of death by his criminal rebellion. The heavy exactions and compulsory labor (1Ki 11:28) which Solomon latterly imposed upon his subjects, when his foreign resources began to fail, had prepared the greater part of the kingdom for a revolt under so popular a demagogue as Jeroboam.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Take thee ten pieces; </span> whence the kingdom of Israel is oft called the kingdom of the ten tribes; by which expression it may seem that David’s posterity should have one tribe reserved out of the kingdom of Israel besides that of Judah, which because of its greatness and eminency, is commonly distinguished from Israel, and that not only after the division of the two kingdoms, but even before it, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-8.htm" title="And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.">1 Samuel 11:8</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-5.htm" title="In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.">2 Samuel 5:5</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said to Jeroboam, take thee ten pieces,....

He further states that in point of fact the kingdom of Jeroboam only consisted of <span class="accented">nine</span> tribes, that of Simeon being practically surrounded by the territory of Judah, and so becoming incorporated in the southern kingdom. But surely, if that had been the idea in the prophet's mind, it would have been better expressed had he torn off <span class="accented">one</span> piece from the garment and given the rest, undivided, to Jeroboam (Bahr). And the reference to the number of the tribes is unmistakable. As to Simeon, we have no means of knowing what part that tribe, if it still existed, took at the division of the kingdom. See on 1 Kings 19:3. Its members had long been scattered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a>), and it gradually dwindled away, and has already disappeared from the history. But even if it had a corporate existence and <span class="accented">did</span> follow the lead of Judah, still that is not con. clusive on the question, for we know not only that the historian uses round numbers, but also that we are not to look for exact statements, as the next verse proves] <span class="cmt_word">to thee.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A second adversary of Solomon was Rezon, the son of Eliadah (for the name see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>), who had fled from his lord Hadadezer, king of Zobah, and who became the captain of a warlike troop (&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;), when David smote them (&#1488;&#1514;&#1501;), i.e., the troops of his lord (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3-4</a>). Rezon probably fled from his lord for some reason which is not assigned, when the latter was engaged in war with David, before his complete overthrow, and collected together a company from the fugitives, with which he afterwards marched to Damascus, and having taken possession of that city, made himself king over it. This probably did not take place till towards the close of David's reign, or even after his death, though it was at the very beginning of Solomon's reign; for "he became an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon (i.e., during the whole of his reign), and that with (beside) the mischief which Hadad did, and he abhorred Israel (i.e., became disgusted with the Israelitish rule), and became king over Aram." &#1492;&#1491;&#1491; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is an abbreviated expression, to which &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; may easily be supplied, as it has been by the lxx (vid., Ewald, 292, b., Anm.). It is impossible to gather from these few words in what the mischief done by Hadad to Solomon consisted.<p>(Note: What Josephus (Ant. viii. 7, 6) relates concerning an alliance between Hadad and Rezon for the purpose of making hostile attacks upon Israel, is merely an inference drawn from the text of the lxx, and utterly worthless.)<p>Rezon, on the other hand, really obtained possession of the rule over Damascus. Whether at the beginning or not till the end of Solomon's reign cannot be determined, since all that is clearly stated is that he was Solomon's adversary during the whole of his reign, and attempted to revolt from him from the very beginning. If, however, he made himself king of Damascus in the earliest years of his reign, he cannot have maintained his sway very long, since Solomon afterwards built or fortified Tadmor in the desert, which he could not have done if he had not been lord over Damascus, as the caravan road from Gilead to Tadmor (Palmyra) went past Damascus.<p>(Note: Compare Ewald, Gesch. iii. p. 276. It is true that more could be inferred from <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-3.htm">2 Chronicles 8:3</a>, if the conquest of the city of Hamath by Solomon were really recorded in that passage, as Bertheau supposes. But although &#1506;&#1500; &#1492;&#1494;&#1511; is used to signify the conquest of tribes or countries, we cannot infer the conquest of the city of Hamath from the words, "Solomon went to Hamath Zobah &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1494;&#1511; and built Tadmor," etc., since all that &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; &#1497;&#1495;&#1494;&#1511; distinctly expresses is the establishment of his power over the land of Hamath Zobah. And this Solomon could have done by placing fortifications in that province, because he was afraid of rebellion, even if Hamath Zobah had not actually fallen away from his power.) </body></html>
