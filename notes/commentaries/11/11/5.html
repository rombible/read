As usual in all phases of Natureworship, Ashtoreth is variously represented, sometimes by the moon, sometimes by the planet Venus (like the Assyrian <span class= "ital">Ishtar</span>, which seems a form of the same name)—in either case regarded as “the queen of heaven.” (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-17.htm" title="But we will certainly do whatever thing goes forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.">Jeremiah 44:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-25.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; You and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her: you will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.">Jeremiah 44:25</a>). There seems, indeed, some reason to believe that the name itself is derived from a root which is found both in Syriac and Persian, and which became <span class= "ital">aster</span> in the Greek and <span class= "ital">astrum</span> in Latin, and has thence passed into modern European languages, signifying a “star,” or luminary of heaven. With this agrees the ancient name, <span class= "ital">Ashterôth-Karnaîm</span> (or, “the horned Ashteroth”)of a city in Bashan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm" title="And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,">Genesis 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-4.htm" title="After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelled in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelled at Astaroth in Edrei:">Deuteronomy 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-12.htm" title="All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for these did Moses smite, and cast them out.">Joshua 13:12</a>). This place is the first in which the name Ashtoreth is used in the singular number, and expressly limited to the “goddess of the Ziaonians.” In the earlier history we hear not unfrequently of the worship of the “Ashtaroth,” that is, of the “Ashtoreths,” found with the like plural Baalim, as prevalent in Canaan, and adopted by Israel in evil times (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-13.htm" title="And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.">Judges 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-6.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.">Judges 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-3.htm" title="And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If you do return to the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts to the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.">1Samuel 7:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-10.htm" title="And they cried to the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.">1Samuel 12:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-10.htm" title="And they put his armor in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.">1Samuel 31:10</a>); and the worship of the <span class= "ital">Asherah</span> (rendered “groves” in the Authorised version), may perhaps refer to emblems of Astarte. In these cases, however, it seems not unlikely that the phrase, “Baalim and Ashtaroth,” may be used generally of the gods and goddesses of various kinds of idolatry. The worship of the Tyrian Ashtoreth, as might be supposed from the idea which she was supposed to represent, was one of chartered license and impurity.<p><span class= "bld">Milcom, the abomination of the Ammonites.</span>—The name <span class= "ital">Milcom</span> (like the <span class= "ital">Malcham</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-1.htm" title="Concerning the Ammonites, thus said the LORD; Has Israel no sons? has he no heir? why then does their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?">Jeremiah 49:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-3.htm" title="Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, you daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together.">Jeremiah 49:3</a>) is probably only a variety of the well-known <span class= "ital">Molech</span>, which is actually used for it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-7.htm" title="Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.">1Kings 11:7</a>. The name “Molech” (though here connected expressly with the Ammonite idolatry) is a general title, signifying only “king” (as Baal signifies “lord”), and might be applied to the supreme god of any idolatrous system. Thus the worship of “Molech,” with its horrible sacrifice of children “passing through the fire,” is forbidden in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-21.htm" title="And you shall not let any of your seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shall you profane the name of your God: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-2.htm" title="Again, you shall say to the children of Israel, Whoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that gives any of his seed to Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.">Leviticus 20:2</a>, evidently as prevailing among the Canaanite races (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/106-37.htm" title="Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to devils,">Psalm 106:37-38</a>). Again, we know historically that similar sacrifice of children, by the same horrible rite, was practised by the Carthaginians in times of great national calamity—the god being in that case identified with Saturn, the star of malign influence. By comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm" title="And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.">Jeremiah 7:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/19-5.htm" title="They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings to Baal, which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into my mind:">Jeremiah 19:5-6</a>, it is very evident that this human sacrifice to Molech is also called “a burnt-offering to Baal;” and if Molech was the “fire-god,” and Baal the “sun-god,” the two deities might easily be regarded as cognate, if not identical. It is notable that, in this place, while Ashtoreth is mentioned, there is no reference to any worship of the Phœnician Baal as such; possibly the Ammonite Molech-worship may have occupied its place. In any case, as the worship of Ashtoreth was stained with impurity, so the Molech-worship was marked by the other foul pollution of the sacrifice of human blood.<p><span class= "bld">Chemosh, the abomination of the Moabites.</span>—The name <span class= "ital">Chemosh</span> probably means “the Conqueror,” or “Subjugator,” and indicates a god of battles. He is again and again described as the god of the Moabites who are called “the people of Chemosh” (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-29.htm" title="Woe to you, Moab! you are undone, O people of Chemosh: he has given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity to Sihon king of the Amorites.">Numbers 21:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-7.htm" title="For because you have trusted in your works and in your treasures, you shall also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his priests and his princes together.">Jeremiah 48:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-13.htm" title="And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.">Jeremiah 48:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-46.htm" title="Woe be to you, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perishes: for your sons are taken captives, and your daughters captives.">Jeremiah 48:46</a>); and the Moabite Stone speaks of the slain in war as an offering to Chemosh, and even refers to a deity, “Ashtar-Chemosh,” which looks like a conjunction of Chemosh, like Baal, with Ashtoreth. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-24.htm" title="Will not you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.">Judges 11:24</a>, Jephthah refers to Chemosh as the god of the Ammonite king, an expression which may indicate a temporary supremacy of Moab over Ammon at that time, through which the name “Chemosh” superseded the name “Milcom” as descriptive of the Supreme Power. In the history, moreover, of the Moabite war against Jehoram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/3-26.htm" title="And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even to the king of Edom: but they could not.">2Kings 3:26-27</a>) it seems that to Chemosh, as to Molech, human sacrifice was offered.<p>Probably, in actual practice the various worships of the Tyrians and Canaanites, the Ammonites and the Moabites might run into each other. Unlike the awful and exclusive reverence to the Lord Jehovah, the devotion of polytheistic systems readily welcomes strange gods into its Pantheon. Polytheism is also apt to pass into what has been called “Henotheism,” in which, of many gods each is for the moment worshipped, as if he stood alone, and concentrated in himself the whole attributes of deity. The generality and similarity of meaning in the names, Baal (“lord”), Molech (“king”), and Chemosh (“conqueror”), seem to point in this direction. Still, these worships are described as taking, in Jerusalem, distinct forms and habitations, which continued till the days of Josiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-13.htm" title="And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.">2Kings 23:13</a>), no doubt disused and condemned in days of religious faithfulness, such as those of Jehoshapliat and Hezekiah, but revived, and associated with newer idolatries, in days of apostasy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/11-5.htm" title="For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites....">1 Kings 11:5-7</a></span>. <span class="ital">Solomon went after Ashtoreth — </span>Called also Astarte.

Solomon became a public worshipper of abominable idols! Probably he by degrees gave way to pride and luxury, and thus lost his relish for true wisdom. Nothing forms in itself a security against the deceitfulness and depravity of the human heart. Nor will old age cure the heart of any evil propensity. If our sinful passions are not crucified and mortified by the grace of God, they never will die of themselves, but will last even when opportunities to gratify them are taken away. Let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall. We see how weak we are of ourselves, without the grace of God; let us therefore live in constant dependence on that grace. Let us watch and be sober: ours is a dangerous warfare, and in an enemy's country, while our worst foes are the traitors in our own hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Went after - This expression is common in the Pentateuch, and always signifies actual idolatry (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-28.htm">Deuteronomy 11:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-2.htm">Deuteronomy 13:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-14.htm">Deuteronomy 28:14</a>, etc.).<p>For Ashtoreth, or Astarte, the goddess of the Zidonians, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-13.htm">Exodus 34:13</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-21.htm">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>, note.

As Baal has been identified with the sun, so Ashtoreth has by some been thought to be the moon. Recent investigations have however connected the name of Ashtoreth with the planet Venus, and by some it is thought that the name was applied in some parts of the Phœnician settlements to Venus, in others to the moon. Ashtoreth is identified with the Greek <span class="greekheb">Ἀστάρτη</span>, and the name of an ancient city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm" title="And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,">Genesis 14:5</a>) <span class="ital">Ashteroth-Karnaim</span>, i.e. Ashteroth of the two horns, seems to point to the crescent moon. This is accepted by Milton (<span class="ital">Par. L</span>. I. 438).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Ashtoreth, whom the Phœnicians called<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Astartè, queen of heaven, with crescent horns<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To whose bright image, nightly by the moon<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The worship of Ashtoreth was very widespread, as might be expected from the wide commercial relations, and distant colonies, of the Phœnicians. Why Ashtoreth is here named ‘goddess’ while the other deities are called ‘abominations’ may be due to the greater intercourse between Sidon and the Holy Land than existed with other countries. The Phœnician workmen at the Temple had perhaps caused the Israelites to become more accustomed to the name and worship of Ashtoreth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites</span>] This is the same divinity who is called below (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-7.htm" title="Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.">1 Kings 11:7</a>) Molech, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-5.htm" title="And them that worship the host of heaven on the housetops; and them that worship and that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham;">Zephaniah 1:5</a> Malcham. Molech was a fire god, and was worshipped with human sacrifices. The root of the word is the same as that of the Hebrew word for ‘king.’ Hence some think ‘their king’ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-30.htm" title="And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.">2 Samuel 12:30</a> means Molech, the god of the Ammonites. There are numerous allusions in the Old Test. to the worship of this god, the phrase most common being ‘to make their children to pass through the fire to Molech.’ See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-10.htm" title="And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.">2 Kings 23:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-13.htm" title="And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.">2 Kings 23:13</a>. Some have explained this not as actual burning of the children to death, but as a passing of them between two fires for an ordeal of purification. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-3.htm" title="Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.">2 Chronicles 28:3</a> it is said of Ahaz, ‘He burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and <span class="ital">burnt</span> his children in the fire, after the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah had driven out.’ And the actual burning of the children thus offered is alluded to very plainly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm" title="And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.">Jeremiah 7:31</a>, ‘They have built the high places of Tophet, … <span class="ital">to burn</span> their sons and their daughters in the fire.’ The tradition is that the statue of Molech was of brass and the hands so arranged that the victim slipped from them into a fire which burnt underneath. It may be because there were no such sacrifices offered to Ashtoreth, that she is not spoken of as ‘an abomination.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For Solomon went after</span> [Rawlinson observes that this expression, which is "common in the Pentateuch, always signifies actual idolatry." He cites <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-28.htm">Deuteronomy 11:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-2.htm">Deuteronomy 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-14.htm">Deuteronomy 28:14</a>; but it should be considered that in the two passages last cited the words are added, "and <span class="accented">served</span> them." And the true explanation would seem to be that, though "it is not stated that Solomon himself offered sacrifice to these idols," yet  "even the building of altars for idols was a participation in idolatry, which was irreconcilable with true fidelity to the Lord" (Keil). Bahr contends that the words "went after Ashtoreth," etc., no more involve personal service than the word "built" in ver. 7 involves personal labour; but both expressions show that he regarded these idolatries not only without disfavour, but with positive approval and practical encouragement. "It is not likely he could be so insensate as to adore such deities, but so far was the uxorious king blinded with affection, that he gave not passage only to the idolatry of his heathenish wives, but furtherance" (Bp. Hall). And the distinction, so far as the sin is concerned, between this and actual idolatry is a fine one. It is not implied, however, that Solomon ever discarded the worship of Jehovah. To the end of his reign he would seem to have offered his solemn sacrifices on the great altar thrice a year. But his heart was elsewhere (ver. 9).] <span class="cmt_word">Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> , <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>, probably connected with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>, <span class="accented">stella</span>, and <span class="accented">star</span>, by some identified with the planet Venus, by others with the moon, is here mentioned for the first time in the singular (<span class="accented">Ashtaroth</span>, plural, is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-13.htm">Judges 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-6.htm">Judges 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-4.htm">1 Samuel 7:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-10.htm">1 Samuel 12:10</a>, etc.) With Baal, she divided the worship of the Phoenicians, the antiquity of which is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-41.htm">Numbers 22:41</a>. It was really an impure cultus of the reproductive powers (see below on 1 Kings 14:23). Interesting proof of the existence of a temple of this goddess at Sidon is supplied by an inscription discovered there in 1855 (see Dict. Bib. 1:123) ], <span class="cmt_word">and after Milcom</span> [In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-13.htm">Jeremiah 49:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>, "Malcam," <span class="accented">i.e., their king</span>.

But it seems more probable that it was the same deity, worshipped (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10, 13</a>) under different attributes. This is "the first direct historical allusion" to his worship in the Old Testament. A warning against it is found <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2-5</a>. He was the fire god, as Baal was the sun god, and the sacrifices offered to him were those of children, who would seem to have not only "passed <span class="accented">through</span> the fire," but to have been burnt therein. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-37.htm">Psalm 106:37, 38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-39.htm">Ezekiel 23:39</a>, etc. See Dict.

It must he remembered, however, that we have no record of Jewish children passing through the fire to Molech before the time of Ahaz (Bahr, Keil).] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-16.htm">2 Chronicles 1:16-17</a>). "And (as for) the going out of horses from Egypt for Solomon, a company of king's merchants fetched (horses) for a definite price." This is the only possible explanation of the verse according to the Masoretic punctuation; but to obtain it, the first &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1492; must be connected with &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; in opposition to the accents, and the second must be pointed &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1492;. This is the rendering adopted by Gesenius in his Thesaurus and Lexicon (ed. Dietr. s. v. &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1492;). The meaning company or troop may certainly be justified from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-10.htm">Genesis 1:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-19.htm">Exodus 7:19</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-36.htm">Leviticus 11:36</a>, where the word signifies an accumulation of water. Still there is something very strange not only in the application of the word both to a company of traders and also to a troop of horses, but also in the omission of &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; (horses) after the second &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1492;. Hence the rendering of the lxx and Vulgate deserves attention, and may possibly be the one to be preferred (as Michaelis, Bertheau on Chron., and Movers assume). The translators of these versions have taken &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1492; as the name of a place, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be; &#x395;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#769;, or rather &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#769;, de Coa.<p>(Note: That &#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#769; or &#x39a;&#x3c9;&#x3b5;&#769; is the earliest reading of the lxx, and not the &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#769; of the Cod. Vat. and Alex., is very evident from the statement which we find in the Onomast. of Eusebius (ed. Larsow et Parth. p. 260), &#x39a;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b4;, &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x391;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;; for which Jerome has Coa, quae est juxta Aegyptum, after the Vulgate.)<p>According to this, the rendering would be: "And as for the going out of horses from Egypt and Koa (or Kawe) for Solomon, the king's traders fetched them from Joa (Kawe) for a fixed price." It is true that the situation of Koa cannot be more precisely defined; but there seems to be very little doubt that it was a place for the collection of customs upon the frontier of Egypt.</body></html>
