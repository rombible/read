They are, no doubt, referred to in this place in connection with the prophecy just recorded, and the notice of Jeroboam’s earlier career which it suggests. But it is implied in the case of Hadad, as it is expressly declared in the case of Rezon, that their resistance continued through all Solomon’s reign. They were not, therefore, crushed, even in the days of his greatness, although then probably reduced to practical insignificance; they seem to have become formidable again during his declining years.<p>(14) <span class= "bld">Hadad the Edomite.</span>—The name (or rather, title) <span class= "ital">Hadad</span> (with the kindred names <span class= "ital">Hadar, Hadadezer</span> or <span class= "ital">Hadarezer</span>, and <span class= "ital">Benhadad</span>) is most frequently found as a designation of the kings of Syria. Here, however, as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-35.htm" title="And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.">Genesis 36:35</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-46.htm" title="And when Husham was dead, Hadad the son of Bedad, which smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.">1Chronicles 1:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-50.htm" title="And when Baalhanan was dead, Hadad reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pai; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.">1Chronicles 1:50</a>, it is given to members of the royal family of Edom. According to ancient authorities, it is a Syriac title of the sun—in this respect like the more celebrated title <span class= "ital">Pharaoh</span>—assumed by the king, either as indicating descent from the sun-god, or simply as an appellation of splendour and majesty. The Hadad here mentioned seems to have been the last scion of the royal house, escaping alone, as a child, from the slaughter of his kindred and people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm" title="And the LORD stirred up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.">1 Kings 11:14</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Lord stirred up an adversary to Solomon — </span>All his glory, and riches, and human wisdom availed nothing to preserve his kingdom entire to his posterity, when he turned away from keeping God’s covenant, and fell into idolatry. <span class="ital">Hadad the Edomite — </span>A young prince of the royal family of Idumea, who fled into Egypt when David conquered that country; and, finding favour with the king, settled there.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:14-25 While Solomon kept close to God and to his duty, there was no enemy to give him uneasiness; but here we have an account of two.

Solomon's Adversaries.<p>14-25. the Lord stirred up an adversary&#8212;that is, permitted him, through the impulse of his own ambition, or revenge, to attack Israel. During the war of extermination, which Joab carried on in Edom (2Sa 8:13), this Hadad, of the royal family, a mere boy when rescued from the sword of the ruthless conqueror, was carried into Egypt, hospitably entertained, and became allied with the house of the Egyptian king. In after years, the thought of his native land and his lost kingdom taking possession of his mind, he, on learning the death of David and Joab, renounced the ease, possessions, and glory of his Egyptian residence, to return to Edom and attempt the recovery of his ancestral throne. The movements of this prince seem to have given much annoyance to the Hebrew government; but as he was defeated by the numerous and strong garrisons planted throughout the Edomite territory, Hadad seems to have offered his services to Rezon, another of Solomon's adversaries (1Ki 11:23-25). This man, who had been general of Hadadezer and, on the defeat of that great king, had successfully withdrawn a large force, went into the wilderness, led a predatory life, like Jephthah, David, and others, on the borders of the Syrian and Arabian deserts. Then, having acquired great power, he at length became king in Damascus, threw off the yoke, and was "the adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon." He was succeeded by Hadad, whose successors took the official title of Ben-hadad from him, the illustrious founder of the powerful kingdom of Damascene-Syria. These hostile neighbors, who had been long kept in check by the traditional fame of David's victories, took courage; and breaking out towards the latter end of Solomon's reign, they must have not only disturbed his kingdom by their inroads, but greatly crippled his revenue by stopping his lucrative traffic with Tadmor and the Euphrates.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite,....

This was not unnatural, for the conduct of Solomon may be presumed to have estranged some of his own subjects. The writer, regarding Jehovah as ruler of the world, speaks of this occurrence as brought about by Him. He raised up the adversary. The Hebrew word for ‘adversary’ is here ‘Satan,’ which the LXX. merely transliterates <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἤγειρε κύριος Σατὰν τῷ Σαλωμών</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Hadad the Edomite</span>] Hadad was apparently a common name among the Edomite royal family. We find it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-36.htm" title="And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.">Genesis 36:36</a>) among the list of early Edomite kings, and three verses later, <span class="ital">Hadar</span>, is probably (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-50.htm" title="And when Baalhanan was dead, Hadad reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pai; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.">1 Chronicles 1:50</a>) a mistake of the scribe for Hadad.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he</span> was <span class="ital">of the king’s seed</span>] And, from his action, apparently the heir to the throne. This perhaps accounts for the friendly reception which he found in Egypt. His father had most likely been slain when David attacked Edom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The LXX. (<span class="ital">Vat.</span>) inserts in this verse a notice of Rezon, spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/11-23.htm" title="And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:...">1 Kings 11:23-25</a> below.

Apparently this, like Pharaoh, was a title rather than a name. And, like Pharaoh, it is said to mean <span class="accented">the sun</span>. It was borne by a king of Edom in very early times, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-15.htm">Genesis 25:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-35.htm">Genesis 36:35, 39</a> (in the latter verse, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-15.htm">Genesis 25:15</a>, Hadar is probably a clerical error for Hadad, as the name stands in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-30.htm">1 Chronicles 1:30, 50</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;</span> being so very much alike. Gesenius, however, contends that Hadar is the true reading), and was also a favourite name with the kings of Syria, especially in the forms Benhadad, Hadadezer] <span class="cmt_word">the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"So did he for all his foreign wives," viz., built altars for their gods; for instance, in addition to those already named, he also built an altar for Astarte. These three altars, which are only mentioned in the complete account in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-13.htm">2 Kings 23:13</a>, were sufficient for all the deities of the foreign wives. For the Hittites and Edomites do not appear to have had any deities of their own that were peculiar to themselves. The Hittites no doubt worshipped Astarte in common with the Sidonians, and the Edomites probably worshipped Milcom. In the whole of the Old Testament the only place in which gods of the Edomite are mentioned is in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-20.htm">2 Chronicles 25:20</a>, and there no names are given. Of course we must except Pharaoh's daughter, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1</a>, and the remarks already made in connection with that verse; for she brought no idolatrous worship to Jerusalem, and consequently even in later times we do not find the slightest trace of Egyptian idolatry in Jerusalem and Judah.<p>(Note: From the fact that these places of sacrifice still existed even in the time of Josiah, notwithstanding the reforms of Asa, Jehoshaphat, Joash, and Hezekiah, which rooted out all public idolatry, at least in Jerusalem, Movers infers (Phniz. ii. 3, p. 207), and that not without reason, that there was an essential difference between these sacred places and the other seats of Israelitish idolatry which were exterminated, namely, that in their national character they were also the places of worship for the foreigners settled in and near Jerusalem, e.g., the Sidonian, Ammonitish, and Moabitish merchants, which were under the protection of treaties, since this is the only ground on which we can satisfactorily explain their undisturbed continuance at Jerusalem. But this would not preclude their having been built by Solomon for the worship of his foreign wives; on the other hand, it is much easier to explain their being built in the front of Jerusalem, and opposite to the temple of Jehovah, if from the very first regard was had to the foreigners who visited Jerusalem. The objection offered by Thenius to this view, which Bertheau had already adopted (zur Gesch. der. Isr. p. 323), has been shown by Bttcher (N. exeg. Aehrenl. ii. p. 95) to be utterly untenable.)<p>Burning incense (&#1502;&#1511;&#1496;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;) is mentioned before sacrificing (&#1502;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;), because vegetable offerings took precedence of animal sacrifices in the nature-worship of Hither Asia (vid., Bhr, Symbolik, ii. pp. 237ff.).</body></html>
