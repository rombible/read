Solomon became a public worshipper of abominable idols! Probably he by degrees gave way to pride and luxury, and thus lost his relish for true wisdom. Nothing forms in itself a security against the deceitfulness and depravity of the human heart. Nor will old age cure the heart of any evil propensity. If our sinful passions are not crucified and mortified by the grace of God, they never will die of themselves, but will last even when opportunities to gratify them are taken away. Let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall. We see how weak we are of ourselves, without the grace of God; let us therefore live in constant dependence on that grace. Let us watch and be sober: ours is a dangerous warfare, and in an enemy's country, while our worst foes are the traitors in our own hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Went after - This expression is common in the Pentateuch, and always signifies actual idolatry (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-28.htm">Deuteronomy 11:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-2.htm">Deuteronomy 13:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-14.htm">Deuteronomy 28:14</a>, etc.).<p>For Ashtoreth, or Astarte, the goddess of the Zidonians, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-13.htm">Exodus 34:13</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-21.htm">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>, note.

For the inference, that if a horse cost 150 shekels, a team of four would be obtained for 600, is not quite a certain one, since the chariot itself would certainly not be given in. A hundred and fifty shekels are a little more than 130 thalers (19, 10s. - Tr.), and 600 would be 525 thalers (78, 15s.). These amounts are sufficient to show how untenable the opinion of Movers is, that the sums mentioned are not the prices paid for horses and chariots, but the payment made for their exit, or the customs duty. And his other opinion is quite equally erroneous, namely that the chariots and horses were state carriages and horses of luxury intended for the king. -  The merchants are called the king's traders, not because a portion of their profits went into the royal treasury as the tax upon trade (Bertheau), nor as the brokers who bought for the king (Thenius), but because they carried on their trade for the king's account. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1501; cannot be adduced as evidence to the contrary; for linguists require no proof that this cannot mean "auf ihre Hand," as Thenius assumes. Bttcher's explanation is the right one, namely, "through their hand," inasmuch as they brought the horses and chariots themselves even to those kings who lived at a greater distance, without employing intermediate agents. The kings of the &#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, the Hittites in the wider sense ( equals  Canaanites, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-4.htm">Joshua 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-3.htm">Ezekiel 16:3</a>), and of Aram, were in part Solomon's vassals, since his rule extended over all the Canaanites with the exception of the Phoenicians, and over several kingdoms of Aram. </body></html>
