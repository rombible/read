(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-14.htm" title="In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in to the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.">Esther 2:14</a>.) Nor does the statement here made necessarily imply that at any one time the whole number existed. Still, the numbers here given, though found also in the LXX. and in Josephus, are not only extraordinarily large, but excessive in comparison with the “three- score queens and fourscore concubines” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/6-8.htm" title="There are three score queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.">Song of Solomon 6:8</a>, and disproportionate in the relative number of the superior and inferior wives. It is possible that, in relation to the former, at any rate, the text may be corrupt, though the corruption must be of ancient date.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-3.htm" title="And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.">1 Kings 11:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines — </span>This was multiplying them prodigiously indeed, and pouring contempt on the divine prohibition in the most notorious manner. David had multiplied wives too, although to no such extent as this; but probably the bad example which he had set in this particular, had encouraged Solomon to think it, if not lawful, yet a lesser evil than it really was. One ill act of a good man may do more mischief than twenty of a wicked man. “Without knowing the customs of the princes of the East,” says Dr. Dodd, “their pomp and sumptuousness of living, one might be tempted to wonder of what possible use was this <span class="ital">milliad </span>of wives and concubines. But as Solomon was between forty and fifty years old before he ran into this excess, we cannot but think that he kept this multitude of women more for state than otherwise. Darius Codomanus was wont to carry along with him in his camp no less than three hundred and fifty concubines in time of war; nor was his queen offended at it, for the women used to reverence and adore her, as if she had been a goddess. Father Le Compte, in his history of China, tells us that the emperor has a vast number of wives, chosen out of the prime beauties of the country, many of which he never so much as saw in his whole life: and, therefore, it is not improbable that Solomon, as he found his riches increase, might enlarge his expenses, and endeavour to surpass all the princes of his time in this, as well as in all other kinds of pomp and magnificence.” He was guilty, however, of a flagrant violation of the divine law.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:1-8 There is not a more melancholy and astonishing instance of human depravity in the sacred Scriptures, than that here recorded. Solomon became a public worshipper of abominable idols! Probably he by degrees gave way to pride and luxury, and thus lost his relish for true wisdom. Nothing forms in itself a security against the deceitfulness and depravity of the human heart. Nor will old age cure the heart of any evil propensity. If our sinful passions are not crucified and mortified by the grace of God, they never will die of themselves, but will last even when opportunities to gratify them are taken away. Let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall. We see how weak we are of ourselves, without the grace of God; let us therefore live in constant dependence on that grace. Let us watch and be sober: ours is a dangerous warfare, and in an enemy's country, while our worst foes are the traitors in our own hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These numbers seem excessive to many critics, and it must be admitted that history furnishes no parallel to them. In Sol 6:8 the number of Solomon's legitimate wives is said to be sixty, and that of his concubines eighty. It is, perhaps probable, that the text has in this place suffered corruption. For "700" we should perhaps read "70." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. he had seven hundred wives, princesses&#8212;They were, probably, according to an existing custom, the daughters of tributary chiefs, given as hostages for good conduct of their fathers.<p>concubines&#8212;were legitimate, but lower or secondary wives. These the chief or first wife regards without the smallest jealousy or regret, as they look up to her with feelings of respectful submission. Solomon's wives became numerous, not all at once, but gradually. Even at an early period his taste for Oriental show seems to have led to the establishment of a considerable harem (So 6:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Seven hundred wives, and three hundred concubines; </span> partly for his lust, which being indulged, becomes infinite and unsatiable; and partly from his pride, accounting this a point of honour and magnificence. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines,.... In all 1000, a prodigious number; though these might not be all for use, but for state after the manner of the eastern monarchs; these were a far greater number than are alluded to in Sol 6:8, unless the virgins without number there, were such of these as were not defiled by him; but the number here seems plainly referred to in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-28.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:28</a>, <p>and his wives turned away his heart; both from his duty to his God, and from attendance to his business as a king, especially the former, as follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.</span><p>(b) To whom belonged no dowry.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_kings/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">seven hundred wives, princesses</span>] The numbers in this verse are far in excess of those in the Song of Solomon, which makes mention (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-8.htm" title="The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.">1 Kings 6:8</a>) of threescore queens. But from the instances known of other monarchs there is little reason to question what is stated in this verse. Philippson (<span class="ital">die Israelitische Bibel</span>) tells of the wives of the great Mogul as 1000 in number, and in ancient history there are similar examples. Many of these were probably never seen by the monarch in his life, but counted among his household, as an item of magnificence. It was only by the few who were his more constant companions that Solomon’s heart was turned away.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he had seven hundred wives, princesses</span> [These may have been members of royal or princely houses of neighbouring nations.

It is hardly correct, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g.</span>, to say (as Rawlinson) that the numbers are given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/6-8.htm">Song of Solomon 6:8</a> as "threescore queens and fourscore concubines," for it is obvious that too much importance must not be attached to an <span class="accented">obiter</span> statement ("there are threescore," etc.) in a poetical book, too, and one descriptive of Solomon's youth. The view of Ewald and Keil, again, that these numbers represent the sum total of the inmates of the harem at different periods of Solomon's long reign, rather than the number present at any one time - they would see in the numbers of Song of Solomon <span class="accented">l.c</span>. a statement of the <span class="accented">average strength</span> of the seraglio - though not to be described as evasive, is certainly not the natural interpretation of the words. And these numbers, when we compare them with the establishments of other Eastern potentates, are not found to be at all incredible. The commentators all remind us that Dareius Codomannus, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g.</span>, took with him on his expedition against Alexander 360 <span class="accented">pellices</span>. Or if ancient history, as Rawlinson affirms, furnishes no strict parallel to these figures, the harems of modern Persia and Turkey at any rate have quite equalled that of Solomon. (See Bahr <span class="accented">in loc</span>.) It is true that Rehoboam had only 18 wives and 60 concubines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>), but then Rehoboam was not Solomon.
