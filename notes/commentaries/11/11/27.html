Had not he taught others, that whatever devices are in men's hearts, the counsel of the Lord shall stand? Yet he himself thinks to defeat that counsel.

He was a young man of talent and energy, who, having been appointed by Solomon superintendent of the engineering works projected around Jerusalem, had risen into public notice, and on being informed by a very significant act of the prophet Ahijah of the royal destiny which, by divine appointment, awaited him, his mind took a new turn.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king,....

It could hardly, therefore, have decayed, and there had been no siege to cause a breach. We must understand the word, consequently, not of a part broken down, but  of a portion unbuilt. We have elsewhere suggested that this was the breach in the line of circumvallation, caused by the Tyropsson valley, and that <span class="accented">the Millo</span> was the bank, or rampart which <span class="accented">closed</span> it. And to this view the words of the text lend some confirmation] of the city of David his father. [As Millo was built about the 25th year of Solomon's reign (ch. 9:15), we are enabled to fix approximately the date of Jeroboam's rebellion. It was apparently about ten or twelve years before Solomon's death. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Hadad heard in Egypt of the death of David and Joab, he asked permission of Pharaoh to return to his own country. Pharaoh replied, "What is there lacking to thee with me?" This answer was a pure expression of love and attachment to Hadad, and involved the request that he would remain. But Hadad answered, "No, but let me go." We are not told that Pharaoh then let him go, but this must be supplied; just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-32.htm">Numbers 10:32</a> we are not told what Hobab eventually did in consequence of Moses' request, but it has to be supplied from the context. The return of Hadad to his native land is clearly to be inferred from the fact that, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-25.htm">1 Kings 11:25</a>, he rose up as an adversary of Solomon.<p>(Note: The lxx have supplied what is missing e conjectura: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x391;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; (i.e., Hadad) &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#903; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3b7;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x391;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#903; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x399;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x395;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;. Thenius proposes to alter the Hebrew text accordingly, and draws this conclusion, that "shortly after the accession of Solomon, Hadad, having returned from Egypt, wrested from the power of the Israelites the greatest part of Edom, probably the true mountain-land of Edom, so that certain places situated in the plain, particularly Ezion-geber, remained in the hands of the Israelites, and intercourse could be maintained with that port through the Arabah, even though not quite without disturbance." This conclusion, which is described as "historical," is indeed at variance with <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>, according to which Edom had no king even in the time of Jehoshaphat, but only a vicegerent, and also with <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20</a>, according to which it was not till the reign of Jehoshaphat's son Joram that Edom fell away from Judah. But this discrepancy Thenius sets aside by the remark at <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>, that in Jehoshaphat's time the family of Hadad had probably died out, and Jehoshaphat prudently availed himself of the disputes which arose concerning the succession to enforce Judah's right of supremacy over Edom, and to appoint first a vicegerent and then a new king, though perhaps one not absolutely dependent upon him. But this conjecture as to the relation in which Jehoshaphat stood to Edom is proved to be an imaginary fiction by the fact that, although this history does indeed mention a revolt of the Edomites from Judah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20.htm">2 Chronicles 20</a>; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>), it not only says nothing whatever about the dying out of the royal family of Hadad or about disputes concerning the succession, but it does not even hint at them. - But with regard to the additions made to this passage by the lxx, to which even Ewald (Gesch. iii. p. 276) attributes historical worth, though without building upon them such confident historical combinations as Thenius, we may easily convince ourselves of their critical worthlessness, if we only pass our eye over the whole section (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14-25</a>), instead of merely singling out those readings of the lxx which support our preconceived opinions, and overlooking all the rest, after the thoroughly unscientific mode of criticism adopted by a Thenius or Bttcher. For example, the lxx have connected together the two accounts respecting the adversaries Hadad and Rezon who rose up against Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-23.htm">1 Kings 11:23</a>), which are separated in the Hebrew text, and have interpolated what is sated concerning Rezon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-23.htm">1 Kings 11:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-24.htm">1 Kings 11:24</a> after &#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14</a>, and consequently have been obliged to alter &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1513;&#1474;&#1496;&#1503; &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-25.htm">1 Kings 11:25</a> into &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;, because they had previously cited Hadad and Rezon as adversaries, whereas in the Hebrew text these words apply to Rezon alone. But the rest of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-25.htm">1 Kings 11:25</a>, namely the words from &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; onwards, they have not given till the close of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-22.htm">1 Kings 11:22</a> (lxx); and in order to connect this with what precedes, they have interpolated the words &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x391;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;. The Alexandrians were induced to resort to this intertwining of the accounts concerning Hadad and Rezon, which are kept separate in the Hebrew text, partly by the fact that Hadad and Rezon are introduced as adversaries of Solomon with the very same words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-23.htm">1 Kings 11:23</a>), but more especially by the fact that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-25.htm">1 Kings 11:25</a> of the Hebrew text the injury done to Solomon by Hadad is merely referred to in a supplementary manner in connection with Rezon's enterprise, and indeed is inserted parenthetically within the account of the latter. The Alexandrian translators did not know what to make of this, because they did not understand &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; and took &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; for &#1494;&#1488;&#1514;, &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;. With this reading &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1509; which follows was necessarily understood as referring to Hadad; and as Hadad was an Edomite, &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498; had to be altered into &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x395;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;. Consequently all the alterations of the lxx in this section are simply the result of an arbitrary treatment of the Hebrew text, which they did not really understand, and consist of a collocation of all that is homogeneous, as every reader of this translation who is acquainted with the original text must see so clearly even at the very beginning of the chapter, where the number of Solomon's wives is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-3.htm">1 Kings 11:3</a> of the Hebrew text and interpolated into <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1</a>, that, as Thenius observes, "the true state of the case can only be overlooked from superficiality of observation or from preconceived opinion.") </body></html>
