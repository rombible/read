Solomon became a public worshipper of abominable idols! Probably he by degrees gave way to pride and luxury, and thus lost his relish for true wisdom. Nothing forms in itself a security against the deceitfulness and depravity of the human heart. Nor will old age cure the heart of any evil propensity. If our sinful passions are not crucified and mortified by the grace of God, they never will die of themselves, but will last even when opportunities to gratify them are taken away. Let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall. We see how weak we are of ourselves, without the grace of God; let us therefore live in constant dependence on that grace. Let us watch and be sober: ours is a dangerous warfare, and in an enemy's country, while our worst foes are the traitors in our own hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Chemosh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-29.htm">Numbers 21:29</a> note), seems to have been widely worshipped in Western Asia. His name occurs frequently on the "Moabite-Stone." Car-Chemish, "the fort of Chemosh," a great city of the northern Hittites, must have been under his protection. In Babylon he seems to have been known as Chomus-belus, or Chemosh-Bel.<p>The hill - Olivet. At present the most southern summit only (the "Mons Offensionis") is pointed out as having been desecrated by the idol sanctuaries: but the early Eastern travelers tell us that in their time the most northern suburb was believed to have been the site of the high p ace of Chemosh, the southern one that of Moloch only. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods&#8212;The first was considered a higher act of homage, and is often used as synonymous with worship (2Ki 22:17; 23:5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Having once given way to some few of most beloved wives, he was forced to comply with the rest. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And likewise did he for all his strange wives,....

Ashtoreth, Chemosh and Moloch would suffice for the greater number, but we know of other gods among the nations round about, and the text implies that all were equally regarded. In the LXX. (<span class="ital">Vat</span>.) the order of these eight verses is considerably varied from the Hebrew text, and the narrative commences somewhat differently, thus: ‘And king Solomon was a lover of women, and he had 700 wives, princesses, and 300 concubines.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And likewise did he for all</span> [having done it for one, he must needs do it for all.

She is thereby distinguished from the foreign wives who turned away Solomon's heart from the Lord, so that the blame pronounced upon those marriages does not apply to his marriage to the Egyptian princess (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>). All that is blamed is that, in opposition to the command in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>, Solomon loved (1) many foreign wives, and (2) Moabitish, Ammonitish, and other wives, of the nations with whom the Israelites were not to intermarry. All that the law expressly prohibited was marriage with Canaanitish women (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-16.htm">Exodus 34:16</a>); consequently the words "of the nations," etc., are not to be taken as referring merely to the Sidonian and Hittite women (J. D. Mich.); but this prohibition is extended here to all the tribes enumerated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-2.htm">1 Kings 11:2</a>, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-2.htm">Ezra 9:2</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-3.htm">1 Kings 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-23.htm">Nehemiah 13:23</a>; not from a rigour surpassing the law, but in accordance with the spirit of the law, namely, because the reason appended to the law, ne in idololatriam a superstitiosis mulieribus pellicerentur (Clericus), applied to all these nations. The Moabites and Ammonites, moreover, were not to be received into the congregation at all, not even to the tenth generation, and of the Edomites only the children in the third generation were to be received (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-4.htm">Deuteronomy 23:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-8.htm">Deuteronomy 23:8-9</a>). There was all the less reason, therefore, for permitting marriages with them, that is to say, so long as they retained their nationality or their heathen ways. The words &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501;...&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1514;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; are connected in form with <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-12.htm">Joshua 23:12</a>, but, like the latter, they really rest upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-16.htm">Exodus 34:16</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-3</a>. In the last clause &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; is used with peculiar emphasis: Solomon clave to these nations, of which God had said such things, to love, i.e., to enter into the relation of love or into the marriage relation, with them. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1511; is used of the attachment of a man to his wife (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>) and also to Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-4.htm">Deuteronomy 4:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-20.htm">Deuteronomy 10:20</a>, etc.).</body></html>
