Solomon became a public worshipper of abominable idols! Probably he by degrees gave way to pride and luxury, and thus lost his relish for true wisdom. Nothing forms in itself a security against the deceitfulness and depravity of the human heart. Nor will old age cure the heart of any evil propensity. If our sinful passions are not crucified and mortified by the grace of God, they never will die of themselves, but will last even when opportunities to gratify them are taken away. Let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall. We see how weak we are of ourselves, without the grace of God; let us therefore live in constant dependence on that grace. Let us watch and be sober: ours is a dangerous warfare, and in an enemy's country, while our worst foes are the traitors in our own hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Chemosh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-29.htm">Numbers 21:29</a> note), seems to have been widely worshipped in Western Asia. His name occurs frequently on the "Moabite-Stone." Car-Chemish, "the fort of Chemosh," a great city of the northern Hittites, must have been under his protection. In Babylon he seems to have been known as Chomus-belus, or Chemosh-Bel.<p>The hill - Olivet. At present the most southern summit only (the "Mons Offensionis") is pointed out as having been desecrated by the idol sanctuaries: but the early Eastern travelers tell us that in their time the most northern suburb was believed to have been the site of the high p ace of Chemosh, the southern one that of Moloch only. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-7.

The idea was that on a lofty height the worshipper drew nearer to his god, and so was able to offer a more acceptable sacrifice. Hence the erection of altars on the tops of hills, and these were frequently accompanied with some house or shrine for the image of the god, and hence we read of the ‘houses of the high places.’ Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-31.htm" title="And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.">1 Kings 12:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-32.htm" title="For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.">1 Kings 13:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-29.htm" title="However, every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelled.">2 Kings 17:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-32.htm" title="So they feared the LORD, and made to themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.">2 Kings 17:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-19.htm" title="And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.">2 Kings 23:19</a>. This form of worshipping was so firmly rooted among the Israelites that we read of it constantly down to the reign of Josiah, by whom at length it appears to have been put down (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-19.htm" title="And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.">2 Kings 23:19</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab</span>] Chemosh, though generally called the national god of the Moabites, is said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-24.htm" title="Will not you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.">Jdg 11:24</a>) to have been also the god of the Ammonites. He is first mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-29.htm" title="Woe to you, Moab! you are undone, O people of Chemosh: he has given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity to Sihon king of the Amorites.">Numbers 21:29</a>. The worship now introduced into Jerusalem by Solomon was put down by Josiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-13.htm" title="And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.">2 Kings 23:13</a>). There is nothing in any of the Biblical notices to guide us to an opinion either about the meaning of the name or the nature of the worship offered to Chemosh. An ancient Jewish tradition relates that Chemosh was worshipped under the form of a black star, hence some have identified him with Saturn. But this is no more than conjecture. Milton alludes to the identification of Chemosh with Baal-peor:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Peor his other name, when he enticed<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Israel in Sittim on their march from Nile.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Par. L.</span> I. 412.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the hill that</span> is <span class="ital">before Jerusalem</span>] The hill facing Jerusalem is the mount of Olives. It is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-23.htm" title="And the glory of the LORD went up from the middle of the city, and stood on the mountain which is on the east side of the city.">Ezekiel 11:23</a> as ‘the mountain which is on the east side of the city,’ and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-4.htm" title="And his feet shall stand in that day on the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall split in the middle thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.">Zechariah 14:4</a> as ‘the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east.’ The LXX. (<span class="ital">Vat</span>.) has omitted any mention of ‘the hill before Jerusalem.’ Milton alludes to the position of these idolatrous erections:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘the wisest heart<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Of Solomon he led by fraud to build<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>His temple right against the temple of God<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On that opprobrious hill.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Par. L</span>. I. 400.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The last words allude to a name given to this height in consequence of these buildings, ‘Mons offensionis.’ This name is said (<span class="ital">Dictionary of Bible</span>, 11. 627) to be of late origin. But the words occur in the Vulgate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-13.htm" title="And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.">2 Kings 23:13</a>) ‘ad dexteram partem montis offensionis.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and for Molech</span>] See above on <span class="ital">Milcom</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-5.htm" title="For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.">1 Kings 11:5</a>. The LXX. translates the proper name, and reads <span class="greekheb">καὶ τῷ βασιλεῖ</span>. Milton also reminds us that the word could be translated:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘First Moloch, horrid <span class="ital">king</span>, besmeared with blood<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Of human sacrifice, and parents’ tears<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Though for the noise of drums and timbrels loud<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Their children’s cries unheard.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The allusion in the last words is to the name ‘Tophet,’ as the valley of the son of Hinnom was called where the Moloch-worship went on. This was thought by some to be derived from the Hebrew word <span class="greekheb">תף</span> (<span class="ital">toph</span>) a timbrel. Hence the tradition of drums beaten to drown the cries of the suffering children. There is no warrant for the derivation, nor probably for the tradition. On the whole subject, see Selden, <span class="ital">de Dis Syris</span>, p. 172.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then did Solomon build an high place</span> [see on 1 Kings 3:2] <span class="cmt_word">for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab</span> [The meaning of "Chemosh" is uncertain. Gesenius suggests "Vanquisher" - Chemosh was the god of war. The mention of Ashtar-Chemosh on the Moabite stone "connects the Moabite religion with the Phoenician," where Ashtar is the masculine form of Astarte, and suggests that "Chemosh was connected with the androgynous deities of Phoenicia" (Speaker's Comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-29.htm">Numbers 21:29</a>).

She is thereby distinguished from the foreign wives who turned away Solomon's heart from the Lord, so that the blame pronounced upon those marriages does not apply to his marriage to the Egyptian princess (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>). All that is blamed is that, in opposition to the command in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>, Solomon loved (1) many foreign wives, and (2) Moabitish, Ammonitish, and other wives, of the nations with whom the Israelites were not to intermarry. All that the law expressly prohibited was marriage with Canaanitish women (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-16.htm">Exodus 34:16</a>); consequently the words "of the nations," etc., are not to be taken as referring merely to the Sidonian and Hittite women (J. D. Mich.); but this prohibition is extended here to all the tribes enumerated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-2.htm">1 Kings 11:2</a>, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-2.htm">Ezra 9:2</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-3.htm">1 Kings 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-23.htm">Nehemiah 13:23</a>; not from a rigour surpassing the law, but in accordance with the spirit of the law, namely, because the reason appended to the law, ne in idololatriam a superstitiosis mulieribus pellicerentur (Clericus), applied to all these nations. The Moabites and Ammonites, moreover, were not to be received into the congregation at all, not even to the tenth generation, and of the Edomites only the children in the third generation were to be received (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-4.htm">Deuteronomy 23:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-8.htm">Deuteronomy 23:8-9</a>). There was all the less reason, therefore, for permitting marriages with them, that is to say, so long as they retained their nationality or their heathen ways.
