It is clear from this that the levy for the Temple—perhaps originally exceptional—had served as a precedent for future burdens, not on the subject races only, as at first (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/9-21.htm" title="Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, on those did Solomon levy a tribute of slavery to this day.">1Kings 9:21-22</a>), but on the Israelites also. The LXX. addition makes Jeroboam build for Solomon “<span class= "ital">Sarira</span> in Mount Ephraim” also.<p><span class= "bld">Ahijah the Shilonite.</span>—In the person of Ahijah, prophecy emerges from the abeyance, which seems to overshadow it during the greatness of the monarchy. Even in David’s old age, the prophet Nathan himself appears chiefly as a mere counsellor and servant of the king (see 1 Kings 1), and from the day of his coronation of Solomon we hear nothing of any prophetic action. Solomon himself receives the visions of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-5.htm" title="In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give you.">1Kings 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-2.htm" title="Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built to the name of the LORD, until those days.">1Kings 3:2</a>); upon him, as the Wise Man, rests the special inspiration of God; at the consecration of the Temple he alone is prominent, as the representative and the teacher of the people. Now, however, we find in Ahijah the first of the line of prophets, who resumed a paramount influence like that of Samuel or Nathan, protecting the spirituality of the land and the worship of God, and demanding both from king and people submission to the authority of the Lord Jehovah.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:26-40 In telling the reason why God rent the kingdom from the house of Solomon, Ahijah warned Jeroboam to take heed of sinning away his preferment. Yet the house of David must be supported; out of it the Messiah would arise. Solomon sought to kill his successor. Had not he taught others, that whatever devices are in men's hearts, the counsel of the Lord shall stand? Yet he himself thinks to defeat that counsel. Jeroboam withdrew into Egypt, and was content to live in exile and obscurity for awhile, being sure of a kingdom at last. Shall not we be content, who have a better kingdom in reserve?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A mighty man of valor - Here "a man of strength and activity."

He was a young man of talent and energy, who, having been appointed by Solomon superintendent of the engineering works projected around Jerusalem, had risen into public notice, and on being informed by a very significant act of the prophet Ahijah of the royal destiny which, by divine appointment, awaited him, his mind took a new turn.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A mighty man of valour, </span> or, a man of great strength of body, <span class="ital">or courage of mind</span>, or both. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Industrious; </span> ingenious, and diligent, and active, and every way fit for business and for command. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Over all the charge, </span> i.e. the taxes and tributes which were to be gathered of the people by his power and authority. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of the house of Joseph; </span> either of Ephraim and Manasseh, who were jointly comprehended under this name, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-17.htm" title="And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, You are a great people, and have great power: you shall not have one lot only:">Joshua 17:17</a></span>; or of Ephraim only, who elsewhere comes under that name, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-1.htm" title="Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he was the firstborn; but for as much as he defiled his father's bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright.">1 Chronicles 5:1</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-67.htm" title="Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:">Psalm 78:67</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-6.htm" title="And I will lay sinews on you, and will bring up flesh on you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live; and you shall know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 37:6</a></span>.

The labour here spoken of is that compulsory work, which the Israelites did by turns for parts of the year, and which the tributary subject-population were constantly employed upon. It is not difficult to conceive circumstances under which such duty might become very distasteful to the northern section of the kingdom. For between them and the people of Judah there was a pronounced opposition even in David’s time. And the compulsory labour on the walls of Jerusalem was just the sort of occupation to aggravate this old enmity. Jeroboam saw this and took advantage of it.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour</span> [same expression <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-1.htm">Judges 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-20.htm">2 Kings 15:20</a>.

Pharaoh replied, "What is there lacking to thee with me?" This answer was a pure expression of love and attachment to Hadad, and involved the request that he would remain. But Hadad answered, "No, but let me go." We are not told that Pharaoh then let him go, but this must be supplied; just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-32.htm">Numbers 10:32</a> we are not told what Hobab eventually did in consequence of Moses' request, but it has to be supplied from the context. The return of Hadad to his native land is clearly to be inferred from the fact that, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-25.htm">1 Kings 11:25</a>, he rose up as an adversary of Solomon.<p>(Note: The lxx have supplied what is missing e conjectura: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x391;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; (i.e., Hadad) &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#903; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3b7;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x391;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#903; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x399;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x395;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;. Thenius proposes to alter the Hebrew text accordingly, and draws this conclusion, that "shortly after the accession of Solomon, Hadad, having returned from Egypt, wrested from the power of the Israelites the greatest part of Edom, probably the true mountain-land of Edom, so that certain places situated in the plain, particularly Ezion-geber, remained in the hands of the Israelites, and intercourse could be maintained with that port through the Arabah, even though not quite without disturbance." This conclusion, which is described as "historical," is indeed at variance with <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>, according to which Edom had no king even in the time of Jehoshaphat, but only a vicegerent, and also with <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20</a>, according to which it was not till the reign of Jehoshaphat's son Joram that Edom fell away from Judah. But this discrepancy Thenius sets aside by the remark at <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>, that in Jehoshaphat's time the family of Hadad had probably died out, and Jehoshaphat prudently availed himself of the disputes which arose concerning the succession to enforce Judah's right of supremacy over Edom, and to appoint first a vicegerent and then a new king, though perhaps one not absolutely dependent upon him. But this conjecture as to the relation in which Jehoshaphat stood to Edom is proved to be an imaginary fiction by the fact that, although this history does indeed mention a revolt of the Edomites from Judah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20.htm">2 Chronicles 20</a>; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>), it not only says nothing whatever about the dying out of the royal family of Hadad or about disputes concerning the succession, but it does not even hint at them. - But with regard to the additions made to this passage by the lxx, to which even Ewald (Gesch. iii. p. 276) attributes historical worth, though without building upon them such confident historical combinations as Thenius, we may easily convince ourselves of their critical worthlessness, if we only pass our eye over the whole section (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14-25</a>), instead of merely singling out those readings of the lxx which support our preconceived opinions, and overlooking all the rest, after the thoroughly unscientific mode of criticism adopted by a Thenius or Bttcher. For example, the lxx have connected together the two accounts respecting the adversaries Hadad and Rezon who rose up against Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-23.htm">1 Kings 11:23</a>), which are separated in the Hebrew text, and have interpolated what is sated concerning Rezon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-23.htm">1 Kings 11:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-24.htm">1 Kings 11:24</a> after &#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14</a>, and consequently have been obliged to alter &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1513;&#1474;&#1496;&#1503; &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-25.htm">1 Kings 11:25</a> into &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;, because they had previously cited Hadad and Rezon as adversaries, whereas in the Hebrew text these words apply to Rezon alone. But the rest of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-25.htm">1 Kings 11:25</a>, namely the words from &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; onwards, they have not given till the close of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-22.htm">1 Kings 11:22</a> (lxx); and in order to connect this with what precedes, they have interpolated the words &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x391;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;. The Alexandrians were induced to resort to this intertwining of the accounts concerning Hadad and Rezon, which are kept separate in the Hebrew text, partly by the fact that Hadad and Rezon are introduced as adversaries of Solomon with the very same words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-23.htm">1 Kings 11:23</a>), but more especially by the fact that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-25.htm">1 Kings 11:25</a> of the Hebrew text the injury done to Solomon by Hadad is merely referred to in a supplementary manner in connection with Rezon's enterprise, and indeed is inserted parenthetically within the account of the latter. The Alexandrian translators did not know what to make of this, because they did not understand &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; and took &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; for &#1494;&#1488;&#1514;, &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;. With this reading &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1509; which follows was necessarily understood as referring to Hadad; and as Hadad was an Edomite, &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498; had to be altered into &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x395;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;. Consequently all the alterations of the lxx in this section are simply the result of an arbitrary treatment of the Hebrew text, which they did not really understand, and consist of a collocation of all that is homogeneous, as every reader of this translation who is acquainted with the original text must see so clearly even at the very beginning of the chapter, where the number of Solomon's wives is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-3.htm">1 Kings 11:3</a> of the Hebrew text and interpolated into <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1</a>, that, as Thenius observes, "the true state of the case can only be overlooked from superficiality of observation or from preconceived opinion.") </body></html>
