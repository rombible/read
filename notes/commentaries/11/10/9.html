Thus she tacitly admonishes Solomon that he was not made king that he might live in ease, and pleasure, and splendour, but for the good of his people. Such views even the wise heathen had, considering civil government as appointed of God, not for the emolument or aggrandizement of the governor, but for the good of society. Thus Aristotle, in a letter to Alexander, exhorts him to keep in mind, that his kingdom was given him by God for the sake of mankind, that he might do them good, and not tyrannise over them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:1-13 The queen of Sheba came to Solomon to hear his wisdom, thereby to improve her own. Our Saviour mentions her inquiries after God, by Solomon, as showing the stupidity of those who inquire not after God, by our Lord Jesus Christ. By waiting and prayer, by diligently searching the Scriptures, by consulting wise and experienced Christians, and by practising what we have learned, we shall be delivered from difficulties. Solomon's wisdom made more impression upon the queen of Sheba than all his prosperity and grandeur. There is a spiritual excellence in heavenly things, and in consistent Christians, to which no reports can do justice. Here the truth exceeded; and all who, through grace, are brought to commune with God, will say the one half was not told them of the pleasures and the advantages of wisdom's ways. Glorified saints, much more, will say of heaven, that the thousandth part was not told them, 1Co 2:9. She pronounced them happy that constantly attended Solomon. With much more reason may we say of Christ's servants, Blessed are they that dwell in his house; they will be still praising him. She made a noble present to Solomon. What we present to Christ, he needs not, but will have us do so to express our gratitude. The believer who has been with Jesus, will return to his station, discharge his duties with readiness, and from better motives; looking forward to the day when, being absent from the body, he shall be present with the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Blessed be the Lord thy God - This acknowledgment of Yahweh falls below the confessions of Hiram <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-12.htm">2 Chronicles 2:12</a> and Cyrus <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-3.htm">Ezra 1:3</a>.

It could not matter, in the mind of the heathen queen, whether she included one divinity more or less in the number of those she honoured. To her, Jehovah was for Israel what her own divinity was for her own people, the national god to whom the prosperity of the king and his subjects had been a special care.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to set thee on the throne of Israel</span>] In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-8.htm" title="Blessed be the LORD your God, which delighted in you to set you on his throne, to be king for the LORD your God: because your God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he you king over them, to do judgment and justice.">2 Chronicles 9:8</a> the sentence runs ‘to set thee on His throne, to be king for the Lord thy God.’ This turn of the sentence harmonizes entirely with the tone of the Chronicler, who views everywhere the king as Jehovah’s representative and vicegerent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The LXX. expands the closing words of the verse, but not in such wise as to change the sense.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed be the Lord thy God</span> [From this mention of the name of Jehovah, taken in connexion with <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>, it has been concluded that the queen became a convert to the faith of Israel. But this inference is unwarranted. Polytheism permitted, and, indeed, encouraged, a full recognition of the gods many of the different races and regions. See on 1 Kings 5:7, and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-12.htm">2 Chronicles 2:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-3.htm">Ezra 1:3</a>.

"And spake to Solomon all that she had upon her heart," i.e., in this connection, whatever riddles she had it in her mind to lay before him; "and Solomon told her all her sayings," i.e., was able to solve all her riddles. There is no ground for thinking of sayings of a religious nature, as the earlier commentators supposed, but simply of sayings the meaning of which was concealed, and the understanding of which indicated very deep wisdom.</body></html>
