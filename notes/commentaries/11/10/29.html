Of all the earlier inhabitants of Palestine the Hittites alone are mentioned as having existed in power after the conquest (as here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-6.htm" title="For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, See, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come on us.">2Kings 7:6</a>); and this statement is curiously confirmed by both Egyptian and Assyrian inscriptions, describing a powerful confederacy of Hittites in the valley of the Orontes in Syria, not far from Phœnicia, with whom both empires waged war. The possession of horses and chariots by the northern confederacy round Hazor is especially noted in the history of the Conquest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/11-4.htm" title="And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is on the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.">Joshua 11:4-6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-29.htm" title="And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.">1 Kings 10:29</a></span>. <span class="ital">A chariot came up — out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, </span>&c. — Egypt being then the most famous country in the world for horses and chariots, and all Asia being supplied from thence, Solomon, who possessed, as it were, the gate of Egypt, by being master of that one only passage, the distance between the <span class="ital">Red </span>and the <span class="ital">Mediterranean sea, </span>took, it seems, an advantage of this, to lay an excessive high tribute on all that were brought out of Egypt that way, to supply Asia and the neighbouring nations; and perhaps he fixed this tribute so high, not only for the sake of gain, but to be a means of preventing the neighbouring nations from increasing their cavalry and chariots of war to too formidable a degree. Poole, however, thinks that this great price is not to be understood as paid for the chariots and horses themselves, but for the lading of the chariots and horses, which, consisting of fine linen and silk, was of great value: and that the king’s custom, together with the charges of the journey, amounted to these sums. <span class="ital">And so for all the kings of the Hittites — </span>A people dwelling principally in the northern and eastern parts of Canaan, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-4.htm" title="From the wilderness and this Lebanon even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.">Joshua 1:4</a>) the posterity of those Hittites who were driven out by the Israelites, and who afterward increased and grew potent, and, it may be, sent out colonies, after the manner of ancient times, into some parts of Syria and Arabia. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:14-29 Solomon increased his wealth. Silver was nothing accounted of. Such is the nature of worldly wealth, plenty of it makes it the less valuable; much more should the enjoyment of spiritual riches lessen our esteem of all earthly possessions. If gold in abundance makes silver to be despised, shall not wisdom, and grace, and the foretastes of heaven, which are far better than gold, make gold to be lightly esteemed? See in Solomon's greatness the performance of God's promise, and let it encourage us to seek first the righteousness of God's kingdom. This was he, who, having tasted all earthly enjoyments, wrote a book, to show the vanity of all worldly things, the vexation of spirit that attends them, and the folly of setting our hearts upon them: and to recommend serious godliness, as that which will do unspeakably more to make us happy, that all the wealth and power he was master of; and, through the grace of God, it is within our reach.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Taking the shekel at about three shillings of our money, six hundred silver shekels would be equal to about 90; and 150 shekels to 22 British pounds and 10 shillings. "Average" price seems to be in each case intended; and we may account for the comparatively high price of the chariot by supposing that by "chariot" is intended the entire equipage, including car, harness, and trained horses, of which there would be two at least, if not three.

These also Solomon’s merchants supplied from Egypt, and in this verse we have the notice of their retail trade.

Their two chief cities were Carchemish and Kadesh. In the early times some Hittite settlements were made in southern Palestine, and we read of these people in the days of the patriarchs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-34.htm" title="And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:">Genesis 26:34</a>, &c.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and for the kings of Syria</span>] Syria (<span class="ital">Heb</span>. Aram) is the name given in the Old Test. to all the country north-east of Phœnicia and extending beyond the Euphrates and Tigris. Sometimes the term includes the Hittite country. Mesopotamia is distinguished (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-10.htm" title="And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.">Genesis 24:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-5.htm" title="Nevertheless the LORD your God would not listen to Balaam; but the LORD your God turned the curse into a blessing to you, because the LORD your God loved you.">Deuteronomy 23:5</a>, &c.) as <span class="ital">Aram-Naharaim</span> (i.e. Syria of the two rivers), and is sometimes called Padan-Aram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-20.htm" title="And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.">Genesis 25:20</a>).

It was for the princes of these districts that Solomon’s merchants brought up horses and chariots from Egypt. All these small kingdoms became afterwards subject to Damascus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by their means</span>] Literally ‘in their hand.’ That is, these merchants were the agents through whom the various princes obtained their supplies.

The word is probably used somewhat loosely of the semi-independent tribes bordering on Palestine, the <span class="accented">Khatti</span> of the Assyrian inscriptions (Dict. Bib. 1:819), with whom Solomon had a sort of alliance. It is a curious coincidence that we find horses and chariots associated in popular estimation with the Hittites, at a later period of the history (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>). Nor are we justified in supposing that these horses and chariots were furnished as cavalry to "Solomon's vassals, whose armies were at his disposal, if he required their aid" (Rawlinson), for the kings of Syria are mentioned presently, and some of these at least were enemies to Solomon. Probably all we are to understand is that neighbouring nations received their supply of horses from Egypt - the home of horses and chariots (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-6.htm">Exodus 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-2.htm">Jeremiah 46:2-4</a>) - largely through the instrumentality of Solomon's merchants], <span class="cmt_word">and for the kings of Syria</span> ["who became the bitterest enemies of Israel" (Wordsworth): one fruit of a worldly policy], did they bring them out by their means.
