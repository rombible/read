Silver was nothing accounted of. Such is the nature of worldly wealth, plenty of it makes it the less valuable; much more should the enjoyment of spiritual riches lessen our esteem of all earthly possessions. If gold in abundance makes silver to be despised, shall not wisdom, and grace, and the foretastes of heaven, which are far better than gold, make gold to be lightly esteemed? See in Solomon's greatness the performance of God's promise, and let it encourage us to seek first the righteousness of God's kingdom. This was he, who, having tasted all earthly enjoyments, wrote a book, to show the vanity of all worldly things, the vexation of spirit that attends them, and the folly of setting our hearts upon them: and to recommend serious godliness, as that which will do unspeakably more to make us happy, that all the wealth and power he was master of; and, through the grace of God, it is within our reach.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These shields, together with the 500 taken by David from Hadadezer <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a> were hung round the outer walls of a building, reckoned as belonging to the "house of the Forest of Lebanon," but separate from it, and called sometimes "the Tower of David" Sol 4:4, or from its use "the armoury" Sol 4:4; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-8.htm">Isaiah 22:8</a>.

The addition of three such maneh of gold to a shield need not make it unwieldy. Of course the gold was only the external covering, not the whole fabric of the shields, though Josephus says the king <span class="ital">cast</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐχώνευσε</span>) these targets and shields of the precious metal.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>in <span class="ital">the house of the forest of Lebanon</span>] On this see above <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-2.htm" title="He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars.">1 Kings 7:2</a>. These golden shields were probably only used on grand occasions, and when not in use were suspended against the numerous pillars in the royal armoury, for which purpose the house of the forest of Lebanon appears to have been built. The shields were carried away in the succeeding reign by Shishak king of Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-26.htm" title="And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.">1 Kings 14:26</a>) and brazen ones were made by Rehoboam to be put in their place.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he made three hundred shield</span>s [portable shields (<span class="accented">peltas</span>, Vulgate) adapted for use in hand to hand encounters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-9.htm">2 Chronicles 12:9, 10</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-21.htm">2 Samuel 1:21</a>). That these were much smaller shields is clear from the text. These shields were borne by the royal bodyguard on great occasions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-27.htm">1 Kings 14:27</a>).

From <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-12.htm">Ezekiel 45:12</a>, however, it would seem that there were <span class="accented">manehs</span> of different value] <span class="cmt_word">of gold went to one shield</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, half as much as to the target]; and the king put them in [Heb. <span class="accented">gave them to</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the house of the forest of Lebanon</span> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2</a>. They would certainly be suspended on the walls, but whether on the inside or the outside is not quite certain, and the text affords us no means of deciding. We know that elsewhere shields were suspended outside the walls of armouries, etc. "At Tyre the beauty of the place was thought to consist in the splendour and variety of the shields of all nations hung on its walls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Ezekiel 27:10, 11</a>). In Rome the temple of Bellona was studded with them. In Athens, the round marks where they hung can still be traced on the walls of the Parthenon. There were also arms hung round the wails of the second temple (Jos., Ant. 15:11.3)," Stanley. It is supposed that along with those made by Solomon were hung the shields taken by David from the Syrians, as according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>, LXX., these latter also were carried off by Shishak. It has been inferred from <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-4.htm">Song of Solomon 4:4</a> that these also were 500 in number, and that the entire thousand were suspended on a part of the house of the forest of Lebanon known as the Tower of David; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-8.htm">Isaiah 22:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/47-9.htm">Psalm 47:9</a>]. The historian now proceeds to describe the great feature of another of Solomon's palaces. As the house of the forest of Lebanon was distinguished by the golden shields which emblazoned and glorified its walls, so was "the porch of judgment" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-7.htm">1 Kings 7:7</a>) by the chryselephantine throne. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The allusion to these costly presents leads the historian to introduce the remark here, that the Ophir fleet also brought, in addition to gold, a large quantity of Algummim wood (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-28.htm">1 Kings 9:28</a>) and precious stones. Of this wood Solomon had &#1502;&#1505;&#1506;&#1491; or &#1502;&#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; made for the temple and palace. &#1502;&#1505;&#1506;&#1491;, from &#1505;&#1506;&#1491;, signifies a support, and &#1502;&#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; may be a later form for &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;, a flight of steps or a staircase, so that we should have to think of steps with bannisters. This explanation is at any rate a safer one than that of "divans" (Thenius), which would have been quite out of place in the temple, or "narrow pannelled stripes on the floor" (Bertheau), which cannot in the smallest degree be deduced from &#1502;&#1505;&#1506;&#1491;, or "support  equals  moveables, viz., tables, benches, footstools, boxes, and drawers" (Bttcher), which neither harmonizes with the temple, where there was no such furniture, nor with the &#1502;&#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; of the Chronicles. "And guitars and harps for the singers," probably for the temple singers. &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; and &#1504;&#1489;&#1500; are string instruments; the former resembling our guitar rather than the harp, the strings being carried over the sounding-board upon a bridge, the latter being of a pitcher shape without any sounding bridge, as in the case of the harps.</body></html>
