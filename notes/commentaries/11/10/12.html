Our Saviour mentions her inquiries after God, by Solomon, as showing the stupidity of those who inquire not after God, by our Lord Jesus Christ. By waiting and prayer, by diligently searching the Scriptures, by consulting wise and experienced Christians, and by practising what we have learned, we shall be delivered from difficulties. Solomon's wisdom made more impression upon the queen of Sheba than all his prosperity and grandeur. There is a spiritual excellence in heavenly things, and in consistent Christians, to which no reports can do justice. Here the truth exceeded; and all who, through grace, are brought to commune with God, will say the one half was not told them of the pleasures and the advantages of wisdom's ways. Glorified saints, much more, will say of heaven, that the thousandth part was not told them, 1Co 2:9. She pronounced them happy that constantly attended Solomon. With much more reason may we say of Christ's servants, Blessed are they that dwell in his house; they will be still praising him. She made a noble present to Solomon. What we present to Christ, he needs not, but will have us do so to express our gratitude. The believer who has been with Jesus, will return to his station, discharge his duties with readiness, and from better motives; looking forward to the day when, being absent from the body, he shall be present with the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Pillars - The Hebrew word signifies ordinarily a "prop" (margin). It is generally supposed to mean in this place a "railing," or "balustrade," a sense which connects and harmonises the present passage with the parallel passage in Chronicles (marginal reference), where Solomon is said to have made of the almug-wood "stairs" for the temple and for his own house.<p>Harps - The Jewish harp &#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;  k&#305;&#770;nno&#770;r was of a triangular shape, and had ordinarily ten strings. It probably resembled the more ancient harp of the Assyrians, which was played with a plectrum, as was (ordinarily) the "kinnor."<p>Psalteries - The psaltery, or viol. Hebrew: &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;  nebel; Greek: &#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;  nabla, was a stringed instrument played with the hand; perhaps a lyre, like those on Hebrew coins, the sounding-board of which is shaped like a jug; or, perhaps, a sort of guitar, with a hollow jug-shaped body at the lower end. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. almug trees&#8212;Parenthetically, along with the valuable presents of the queen of Sheba, is mentioned a foreign wood, which was brought in the Ophir ships. It is thought by some to be the sandalwood; by others, to be the deodar&#8212;a species of fragrant fir, much used in India for sacred and important works. Solomon used it for stairs in his temple and palace (2Ch 9:11), but chiefly for musical instruments.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Almug trees, </span> called also (by an inversion of the letters, which is usual among the Hebrews) <span class="ital">algum trees</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-8.htm" title="Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that your servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with your servants,">2 Chronicles 2:8</a> 9:10</span>; whereof there were some in Lebanon, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-8.htm" title="Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that your servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with your servants,">2 Chronicles 2:8</a></span>, but the best sort came from Ophir, as is here said. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Pillars, </span> or <span class="ital">supporters</span>, either for the ascent or stairs, by which they went from the king’s house to the temple; see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-16.htm" title="To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward, with the gate Shallecheth, by the causeway of the going up, ward against ward.">1 Chronicles 26:16</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-11.htm" title="And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.">2 Chronicles 9:11</a></span>; or for divers parts both of the Lord’s and of the king’s house. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the Lord, and for the king's house,....

It was some later addition, not any part of the fabric, which was already completed. In the parallel place of 2 Chron. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-11.htm" title="(Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.">1 Kings 9:11</a>) there is a different word in the Hebrew, and one usually applied to a ‘highway.’ Both A. V. and R.V. have ‘terraces’ in that passage. If we combine the two narratives it may be that what is intended is a staircase with handrail and balustrade. The former word would suit in Chronicles, where A.

The earlier theologians inferred from this praising of Jehovah, which involved faith in the true God, when taken in connection with <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>, that this queen had been converted to the true God, and conversed with Solomon on religious matters. But, as we have already observed at <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-7.htm">1 Kings 5:7</a>, an acknowledgment of Jehovah as the God of Israel was reconcilable with polytheism. And the fact that nothing is said about her offering sacrifice in the temple, shows that the conversion of the queen is not to be thought of here.</body></html>
