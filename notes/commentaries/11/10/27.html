Hence the division of interest and allegiance manifested at the accession of Rehoboam. In the earlier years of the reign its prosperity is described as extending to all “Judah and Israel” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-20.htm" title="Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.">1Kings 4:20</a>). But the wealth gathered by tribute, and by a commerce entirely in the hands of the king, would enrich only the Court and the capital; and much Oriental history, both ancient and modern, shows that such enrichment might leave the general population impoverished and oppressed<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/10-27.htm" title="And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance....">1 Kings 10:27-28</a></span>. <span class="ital">The king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones — </span>An hyperbolical expression, signifying a great plenty of it. <span class="ital">Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn — </span>The two chief commodities of Egypt. <span class="ital">The king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price — </span>Agreed on between Pharaoh and Solomon, who gave this privilege to his merchants for a tribute to be paid out of this commodity.

Silver was nothing accounted of. Such is the nature of worldly wealth, plenty of it makes it the less valuable; much more should the enjoyment of spiritual riches lessen our esteem of all earthly possessions. If gold in abundance makes silver to be despised, shall not wisdom, and grace, and the foretastes of heaven, which are far better than gold, make gold to be lightly esteemed? See in Solomon's greatness the performance of God's promise, and let it encourage us to seek first the righteousness of God's kingdom. This was he, who, having tasted all earthly enjoyments, wrote a book, to show the vanity of all worldly things, the vexation of spirit that attends them, and the folly of setting our hearts upon them: and to recommend serious godliness, as that which will do unspeakably more to make us happy, that all the wealth and power he was master of; and, through the grace of God, it is within our reach.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Made silver as stones - This strong hyperbole marks in the most striking way the great wealth and prosperity of the capital during Solomon's reign. The lavish expenditure which impoverished the provinces, and produced, or helped to produce, the general discontent that led to the outbreak under Jeroboam, enriched the metropolis, which must have profited greatly by the residence of the court, the constant influx of opulent strangers, and the periodical visits of all Israelites not hindered by some urgent reason at the great festivals.<p>The "sycomore-trees in the vale" (Shephelah) are mentioned also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-28.htm">1 Chronicles 27:28</a>. Like the olives and the vines, they were placed by David under a special overseer, on account of their value. The tree meant seems to be the sycomore proper, or "fig-mulberry," which is still common in Palestine, and is highly esteemed both on account of its fruit and its timber. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26-29.&#8212;(See on [309]2Ch 1:14 [and [310]2Ch 9:25].)   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Sycamore trees</span> were vile and common.

It was esteemed both for its fruit and its wood, so much so that David appointed a steward to have the supervision both of "the olive trees and the sycamore trees in the Shefelah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-28.htm">1 Chronicles 27:28</a>). The sycamores of Egypt, which were used for the coffins of mummies (Dict. Bib. 3. p. 1394), are referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-47.htm">Psalm 78:47</a>, in a way which bespeaks their great value.

The Shefelah is a "broad swelling tract of many hundred miles in area, which sweeps gently down from the mountains of Judah 'to mingle with the bounding main' of the Mediterranean" (Grove, Dict. Bib. 3. p. 1611). This "Low Country" extended from Joppa to Gaza. The translation "vale" is altogether misleading. Conder ("Tent-work," p. 5) describes it as "consisting of low hills, about five hundred feet above the sea, of white soft limestone," and adds that "the broad valleys among these hills...  produce fine crops of corn, and on the hills the long olive groves flourish better than in other districts" - an incidental and valuable confirmation of the text.
