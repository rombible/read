Silver was nothing accounted of. Such is the nature of worldly wealth, plenty of it makes it the less valuable; much more should the enjoyment of spiritual riches lessen our esteem of all earthly possessions. If gold in abundance makes silver to be despised, shall not wisdom, and grace, and the foretastes of heaven, which are far better than gold, make gold to be lightly esteemed? See in Solomon's greatness the performance of God's promise, and let it encourage us to seek first the righteousness of God's kingdom. This was he, who, having tasted all earthly enjoyments, wrote a book, to show the vanity of all worldly things, the vexation of spirit that attends them, and the folly of setting our hearts upon them: and to recommend serious godliness, as that which will do unspeakably more to make us happy, that all the wealth and power he was master of; and, through the grace of God, it is within our reach.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There is no mention in the original of "spice merchants." Two classes of traders are spoken of; but both expressions are general.<p>Kings of Arabia - Rather, "kings of the mingled people" (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-24.htm">Jeremiah 25:24</a>). These were probably tribes half Jewish, half Arabian, on the borders of the western desert. They are regarded as Arabs by the author of Chronicles (marginal reference).<p>Governors - The word used here is thought to be of Aryan origin. It appears to have been a title given by the Persians to petty governors, inferior to the great satraps of provinces. We find it borne by, among others, Tatnai <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-6.htm">Ezra 5:6</a>, Zerubbabel <a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a>, and Nehemiah Neh 5:14. It can scarcely have been in use among the Jews so early as Solomon, and we must therefore suppose it to have been substituted by the writer of Kings for some corresponding Semitic title. The empire of Solomon was not a state governed from a single center by an organisation of satrapies or provinces (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a> note). But exceptionally, in some parts of the empire, the kings had been superseded by "governors" (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-24.htm">1 Kings 20:24</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ki 10:14-29. His Riches.<p>14, 15. Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year&#8212;666 talents, equal to &pound;3,996,000. The sources whence this was derived are not mentioned; nor was it the full amount of his revenue; for this was "Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffic of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country." The great encouragement he gave to commerce was the means of enriching his royal treasury. By the fortifications which he erected in various parts of his kingdom, (particularly at such places as Thapsacus, one of the passages of Euphrates, and at Tadmor, in the Syrian desert), he gave complete security to the caravan trade from the depredations of the Arab marauders; and it was reasonable that, in return for this protection, he should exact a certain toll or duty for the importation of foreign goods. A considerable revenue, too, would arise from the use of the store cities and khans he built; and it is not improbable that those cities were emporia, where the caravan merchants unloaded their bales of spices and other commodities and sold them to the king's factors, who, according to the modern practice in the East, retailed them in the Western markets at a profit. "The revenue derived from the tributary kings and from the governors of the country" must have consisted in the tribute which all inferior magistrates periodically bring to their sovereigns in the East, in the shape of presents of the produce of their respective provinces.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Of the merchantmen, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">of the searchers</span>, or spies, i.e. either merchants, who use to inquire and search out commodities, and all advantages of trade; or rather, the publicans or gatherers of the king’s revenues, who used to search narrowly into all wares and dealings, that the king might not be defrauded of his rights. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of the spice merchants, </span> or rather, <span class="ital">of the merchants</span> in general, as that word is oft used in <span class="bld"> Eze 27</span>, and elsewhere.

Hence in R.V. the word <span class="bld">chapmen</span> has been adopted, and the clause a little differently worded. Literally it is, ‘beside (what came) from the men of the hawkers,’ and this is represented by ‘beside <span class="ital">that which</span> the chapmen <span class="ital">brought</span>,’ though the literal rendering shews that ‘brought’ might fairly have been printed in Roman and not in italics.

The LXX. renders by <span class="greekheb">ἒμπορος</span> here and elsewhere, and gives here ‘the taxes on the merchants’. Render (as there is no preposition with this clause) <span class="bld">and the traffick of the merchants</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and of all the kings of Arabia</span>] R.V. ‘and of all the kings <span class="bld">of the mingled people</span>.’ The word in the original, though it has the same consonants, has not the same vowels as the proper name. In this text we have <span class="greekheb">הָעֶרֶב</span>, while the other word is <span class="greekheb">עֲרַב</span> = Arabia. That the two are distinct designations is proved by <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-24.htm" title="And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert,">Jeremiah 25:24</a>, where both occur in the same verse, ‘all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the mingled people.’ The word in our text is used very early in the history of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-38.htm" title="And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.">Exodus 12:38</a>) of ‘the mixed multitude’ which came up with the Israelites out of Egypt, and afterwards of people who were in a sort of loose attachment to the kingdom. (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/1-3.htm" title="It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month....">Jeremiah 1:3-7</a>.) In the parallel passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-14.htm" title="Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.">2 Chronicles 9:14</a>) the Hebrew text has the ‘kings of Arabia,’ but the form of the sentence is somewhat altered, and the close connexion of the two sets of persons in the verse already quoted from Jeremiah makes it not unlikely that both were under a sort of tribute to Solomon. The LXX. has <span class="greekheb">τῶν βασιλέων τοῦ πέραν</span>, but the Vulgate ‘reges Arabiæ.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and</span> of <span class="ital">the governors of the country</span>] Most likely those officers are meant whose positions were described <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/4-7.htm" title="And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision....">1 Kings 4:7-19</a>.

It is probable that Solomon's great commercial enterprises were conducted for his own benefit, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that the merchants were little more than agents, who bought and sold for the king. Such is the custom of  Eastern kings (Kitto)], <span class="cmt_word">and of all the kings of Arabia</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span> is very variously interpreted. According to Gesenius it means <span class="accented">foreigners</span>, and he would understand "foreign kings who made an alliance with the Israelites," and so the Chaldee. Keil: "the kings of the mixed population" (mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>.

Perhaps the words are best explained by <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-24.htm">Jeremiah 25:24</a>: "The kings of Arabia (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span>) and ... of the mingled people (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span>) that dwell in the desert," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the desert of <span class="accented">Arabia deserta</span>, bordering on Palestine. The chronicler here gives us <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, not the Arabia of the geographers, but the tract of country south and east of Palestine, as far as the Red Sea (Gesenius). No doubt these kings, who were great sheepmasters, paid their tribute in flocks of sheep and goats (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-11.htm">2 Chronicles 17:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4</a>], <span class="cmt_word">and of the governors of the country.</span> [The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (cf. ch. 20:24) is a foreign word, perhaps Sanskrit, apparently borrowed by the Jews from the Persians. It is used of Tatnai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-6.htm">Ezra 5:6</a>), of Zerubbabel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a>), and of Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-14.htm">Nehemiah 5:14</a>). Probably our author, in whose day it was a familiar and well understood word, substituted it for some older Hebrew designation. But the office and character of these "governors" is more difficult to define than the name. Rawlinson thinks that, in some parts of the empire, the kings - the "empire of Solomon," he observes, "was in the main a <span class="accented">congeries</span> of small kingdoms" - "had been superseded by governors." But it seems as natural to understand the term of the twelve prefects mentioned in chap. 4, who were "the governors of the land," or of similar officers in the different outposts of the kingdom. We know that the contributions which passed through their hands were furnished <span class="accented">in kind</span>; hence, perhaps, it is that this income is distinguished from the gold of ver. 14. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>She then said with astonishment to Solomon, that of what her eyes now saw she had not heard the half, through the report which had reached her of his affairs and of his wisdom, and which had hitherto appeared incredible to her; and not only congratulated his servants, who stood continually near him and could hear his wisdom, but also praised Jehovah his God, that out of His eternal love to His people Israel He had given them a king to do justice and righteousness. The earlier theologians inferred from this praising of Jehovah, which involved faith in the true God, when taken in connection with <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>, that this queen had been converted to the true God, and conversed with Solomon on religious matters. But, as we have already observed at <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-7.htm">1 Kings 5:7</a>, an acknowledgment of Jehovah as the God of Israel was reconcilable with polytheism. And the fact that nothing is said about her offering sacrifice in the temple, shows that the conversion of the queen is not to be thought of here.</body></html>
