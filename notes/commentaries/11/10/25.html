Silver was nothing accounted of. Such is the nature of worldly wealth, plenty of it makes it the less valuable; much more should the enjoyment of spiritual riches lessen our esteem of all earthly possessions. If gold in abundance makes silver to be despised, shall not wisdom, and grace, and the foretastes of heaven, which are far better than gold, make gold to be lightly esteemed? See in Solomon's greatness the performance of God's promise, and let it encourage us to seek first the righteousness of God's kingdom. This was he, who, having tasted all earthly enjoyments, wrote a book, to show the vanity of all worldly things, the vexation of spirit that attends them, and the folly of setting our hearts upon them: and to recommend serious godliness, as that which will do unspeakably more to make us happy, that all the wealth and power he was master of; and, through the grace of God, it is within our reach.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His present - i. e., his tribute (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a> note).

Now, however easily &#1502;&#1488;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1501; may have been written by mistake for &#1502;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;, &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; &#1499;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; cannot have grown out of &#1506;&#1490;&#1493;&#1500; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; by any such mistake.

Beside this there were twelve lions upon the six steps, namely two upon each step, one on this side and one on that. Instead of &#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-20.htm">1 Kings 10:20</a>) we find &#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1512;&#1514; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-19.htm">1 Kings 10:19</a>, just as we do in both verses of the Chronicles, not because the reference is to artificial, inanimate figures and not to natural lions, as Thenius supposes, but because the plural ending  &#1497;&#1501;- is an unusual one with this word; and even where natural lions are spoken of, we always find &#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1512;&#1514; in other passages (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-5.htm">Judges 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-25.htm">2 Kings 17:25</a>; Sol 4:8, etc.). The lions were symbols of the ruler's authority; and the twelve lions upon the steps may possibly have pointed to the rule over the twelve tribes of Israel, which was concentrated in the throne; not "watchers of the throne," as Thenius thinks. This throne was so splendid a work, that the historian observes that nothing of the kind had ever been made for any other kingdom. Upon the early Assyrian monuments we do indeed find high seats depicted, which are very artistically worked, and provided with backs and arms, and some with the arms supported by figures of animals (see Layard's Nineveh and its Remains, vol. ii. p. 301), but none resembling Solomon's throne. It is not till a later age that the more splendid thrones appear (vid., Rosenmller, A. u. N. Morgenland, iii. pp. 176ff.). </body></html>
