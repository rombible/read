Silver was nothing accounted of. Such is the nature of worldly wealth, plenty of it makes it the less valuable; much more should the enjoyment of spiritual riches lessen our esteem of all earthly possessions. If gold in abundance makes silver to be despised, shall not wisdom, and grace, and the foretastes of heaven, which are far better than gold, make gold to be lightly esteemed? See in Solomon's greatness the performance of God's promise, and let it encourage us to seek first the righteousness of God's kingdom. This was he, who, having tasted all earthly enjoyments, wrote a book, to show the vanity of all worldly things, the vexation of spirit that attends them, and the folly of setting our hearts upon them: and to recommend serious godliness, as that which will do unspeakably more to make us happy, that all the wealth and power he was master of; and, through the grace of God, it is within our reach.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The "targets" seem to have been long shields protecting the whole body, while the "shields" of the next verse were bucklers of a smaller size, probably round, and much lighter. They may be compared with the Assyrian long shield, and the ordinary Assyrian round shield. As the amount of gold used in each of the larger shields was only 600 shekels - worth from 650 to 700 of our money - and that used in the smaller ones was only half as much it is evident that the metal did not form the substance of the shields, but was laid as a coating or plating over them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16, 17. two hundred targets, six hundred shekels&#8212;These defensive arms were anciently made of wood and covered with leather; those were covered with fine gold. 600 shekels were used in the gilding of each target&#8212;300 for each shield.

This rendering is supported by Bahr and Keil (after Kimchi), but Gesenius understands <span class="accented">mixed</span> gold. Rawlinson infers from the <span class="accented">weight</span> that the shields were only plated (shields were commonly made of wood, covered with leather). But whether they were solid or not does not decide the question whether the gold was pure or alloyed. "Shields of gold" are mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>; 1 Macc. 6:39]: six hundred shekels [Heb. omits <span class="accented">shekels</span>, as elsewhere, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>, etc. There were apparently two kinds of shekel, the Mosaic and the royal (for the latter see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-26.htm">2 Samuel 14:26</a>). The former was twice as much as the latter, but there is no agreement amongst commentators as to the weight or value of either. Nor can we be certain which is indicated here. Thenius decides for the former, and estimates the weight of the gold on each target to be 17 &frac12; lbs., and the value to be 6000 thalers (&pound;900), or, according to Keil, 5000 thalers (&pound;750). Keil, however, inclines to the belief that the royal shekel is meant, in which case the weight would be 9 lbs., and the value about &pound;400. Bahr, however, estimates the gold at no more than &pound;78 (523 thalers)] of gold went to one target. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>She thereupon presented to Solomon a hundred and twenty talents of gold (more than three million thalers nearly half a million sterling - Tr.]), and a very large quantity of spices and precious stones.
