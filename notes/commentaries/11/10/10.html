Our Saviour mentions her inquiries after God, by Solomon, as showing the stupidity of those who inquire not after God, by our Lord Jesus Christ. By waiting and prayer, by diligently searching the Scriptures, by consulting wise and experienced Christians, and by practising what we have learned, we shall be delivered from difficulties. Solomon's wisdom made more impression upon the queen of Sheba than all his prosperity and grandeur. There is a spiritual excellence in heavenly things, and in consistent Christians, to which no reports can do justice. Here the truth exceeded; and all who, through grace, are brought to commune with God, will say the one half was not told them of the pleasures and the advantages of wisdom's ways. Glorified saints, much more, will say of heaven, that the thousandth part was not told them, 1Co 2:9. She pronounced them happy that constantly attended Solomon. With much more reason may we say of Christ's servants, Blessed are they that dwell in his house; they will be still praising him. She made a noble present to Solomon. What we present to Christ, he needs not, but will have us do so to express our gratitude. The believer who has been with Jesus, will return to his station, discharge his duties with readiness, and from better motives; looking forward to the day when, being absent from the body, he shall be present with the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Strabo relates that the Sabaeans were enormously wealthy, and used gold and silver in a most lavish manner in their furniture, their utensils, and even on the walls, doors, and roofs of their houses. That the gold of Sheba should be given to Solomon was prophesied by the writer of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/72.htm">Psalm 72</a> (see the marginal reference). The immense abundance of spices in Arabia, and especially in the Yemen or Sabaean country, is noted by many writers. According to Strabo, the spice-trade of Arabia was in the hands of two nations, the Sabaeans and the Gerrhaeans. The spices in which they dealt seem to have been only in part the produce of Arabia itself; some of the most important kinds, as the cinnamon and the cassia, must have been imported from India, since Arabia does not yield them. The chief precious stones which Arabia now yields are the onyx and the emerald. Anciently she is said to have produced other gems. Pearls, too, were readily procurable in Arabia from the Persian Gulf fishery. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold&#8212;&pound;720,00.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold,....

Josephus reports (t), that some say that the balsamic plant, which Judea was afterwards so famous for, was brought by this queen, and a gift of hers to Solomon; and Diodorus Siculus (u) speaks of it as in Arabia, and not to be found in any other part of the world. <p>(t) Ut supra, (Antiqu. l. 8. c. 6.) sect. 6.

Josephus however, contrary to his wont, has a less sum here, making the gift only ‘twenty talents’ (<span class="ital">Ant</span>. viii. 6, 6). According to our text, the queen’s present was the same as that which Hiram gave (see above <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-14.htm" title="And Hiram sent to the king six score talents of gold.">1 Kings 9:14</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">there came no more such abundance of spices</span>] Josephus adds to this statement ‘and they say that the root of the opobalsamum (i.e. the balsam tree), which our land still produces, came to us among her gifts.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And the navy also of Hiram</span>] This verse and the next are a parenthetic insertion, brought in by the mention of the spices in the previous verse. Hiram’s fleet went to distant parts, and in the direction of Sheba, but for all that it brought back no such spicery among its imports. This navy is no doubt the same which was spoken of in the previous chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/9-26.htm" title="And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom....">1 Kings 9:26-28</a>). It is called Hiram’s because he supplied the wood for building it, and the sailors for its manning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">great plenty of almug trees</span>] The name is spelt in the text of Chronicles ‘algum’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-8.htm" title="Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that your servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with your servants,">2 Chronicles 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/9-10.htm" title="And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones....">2 Chronicles 9:10-11</a>), and is probably a word adopted from the language of the country where the wood was produced, and about the spelling of which Hebrew writers were not very sure, as Englishmen were not in former days about <span class="ital">tea</span>, which may be found spelt ‘tcha.’ What the wood was is a question of some difficulty. It was clearly an imported article, for what is said <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-8.htm" title="Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that your servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with your servants,">2 Chronicles 2:8</a>, ‘Send me algum trees out of Lebanon,’ must be understood not of trees growing there, but of wood which the Tyrians procured in their trade, and would send along with the timber which grew on Lebanon. The Rabbinical writers use <span class="ital">almug</span> for coral, and if this be an old Hebrew word, it may have been applied to these trees, because of the colour of their wood. But about the antiquity of the word we have no evidence. Most moderns incline to the opinion that sandal-wood is intended, though some, considering the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-8.htm" title="Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that your servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with your servants,">2 Chronicles 2:8</a> to imply a tree grown on Lebanon, prefer to regard it as a kind of cedar or cypress. Evidently the LXX. had no light on the subject, the renderings there given being <span class="greekheb">πελεκητὰ</span> (or <span class="greekheb">ἀπελέκητα</span>) and <span class="greekheb">πεύκινα</span>. The Vulgate renders it <span class="ital">thyina</span>, the wood of the <span class="greekheb">θυία</span>, which is akin to the <span class="ital">Arbor vitœ</span>. Some of the uses to which it was put, as mentioned in the next verse, seem to require a stouter material than sandal-wood.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant.</span> viii. 7, i) calls the trees <span class="greekheb">ξύλα πεύκινα</span>, but says it was unlike the wood which went by the name of <span class="ital">pine</span> in his day. ‘Let no one suppose,’ he says, ‘that this wood was like that called <span class="ital">pine wood</span> now, and which sellers call so for the bewilderment of buyers. The wood spoken of here resembles the wood of the fig tree, but is whiter and glitters more.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she gave the king an hundred and twenty</span> [Josephus says <span class="accented">twenty</span>] <span class="cmt_word">talents of gold</span> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-15.htm">Psalm 72:15</a>.

The two following verses form a sort of parenthesis. In speaking of the gold and gems brought by the Arabian queen, it occurs to the historian to state that both of these commodities were also brought in by the fleet. Possibly, too, the mention of the spices reminded him of the fragrant almug trees brought from Ophir (Bahr). But it would rather seem that they are included as one of the chief products of the voyage. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>She saw &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, i.e., Solomon's palace, not the temple, and "the food of his table," i.e., both the great variety of food that was placed upon the king's table (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-2.htm">1 Kings 5:2-3</a>), and also the costly furniture of the table (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21</a>), and "the seat of his retainers and the standing of his servants," i.e., the places in the palace assigned to the ministers and servants of the king, which were contrived with wisdom and arranged in a splendid manner. &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; are the chief officers of the king, viz., ministers, counsellors, and aides de camp; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, the court servants; &#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, the rooms of the courtiers in attendance; &#1502;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, the standing-place, i.e., the rooms of the inferior servants, "and their clothing," which they received from the king; and &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1497;&#1493;, not his cup-bearers (lxx, Vulg.), but as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-21.htm">Genesis 40:21</a>, the drink, i.e., probably the whole of the drinking arrangements; &#1493;&#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;, and his ascent, by which he was accustomed to go into the house of Jehovah. &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; does not mean burnt-offering here, as the older translators have rendered it, but ascent, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-26.htm">Ezekiel 40:26</a>, and as the Chronicles have correctly explained it by &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;.
