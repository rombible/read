Sheba is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-22.htm" title="The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were your merchants: they occupied in your fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.">Ezekiel 27:22</a> as trafficking with Tyre “in chief of all spices, and precious stones, and gold.” The spices of “the incensebearing sands” of Arabia are constantly dwelt upon both in Greek and Roman literature. Frankincense especially was imported from Arabia into Palestine (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-6.htm" title="The multitude of camels shall cover you, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises of the LORD.">Isaiah 60:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-20.htm" title="To what purpose comes there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet to me.">Jeremiah 6:20</a>), although now it comes chiefly from India. Myrrh also was in ancient times drawn chiefly from Arabia. Cassia is a product of Arabia and India. Of all spices, the frankincense for sacrifice and the myrrh for embalming the dead would be most in request.<p><span class= "bld">Gold, and precious stones.</span>—These may have been native products of Sheba, or have been brought from the farther East. Gold is not now known to exist in Arabia, nor any precious stones except the onyx and the emerald. But in ancient times it was commonly believed to produce both gold and precious stones largely.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/10-2.htm" title="And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bore spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart....">1 Kings 10:2-3</a></span>. <span class="ital">She communed with him of all that was in her heart — </span>Of all the doubts and difficulties wherewith her mind was perplexed.

Our Saviour mentions her inquiries after God, by Solomon, as showing the stupidity of those who inquire not after God, by our Lord Jesus Christ. By waiting and prayer, by diligently searching the Scriptures, by consulting wise and experienced Christians, and by practising what we have learned, we shall be delivered from difficulties. Solomon's wisdom made more impression upon the queen of Sheba than all his prosperity and grandeur. There is a spiritual excellence in heavenly things, and in consistent Christians, to which no reports can do justice. Here the truth exceeded; and all who, through grace, are brought to commune with God, will say the one half was not told them of the pleasures and the advantages of wisdom's ways. Glorified saints, much more, will say of heaven, that the thousandth part was not told them, 1Co 2:9. She pronounced them happy that constantly attended Solomon. With much more reason may we say of Christ's servants, Blessed are they that dwell in his house; they will be still praising him. She made a noble present to Solomon. What we present to Christ, he needs not, but will have us do so to express our gratitude. The believer who has been with Jesus, will return to his station, discharge his duties with readiness, and from better motives; looking forward to the day when, being absent from the body, he shall be present with the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-10.htm">1 Kings 10:10</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels&#8212;A long train of those beasts of burden forms the common way of travelling in Arabia; and the presents specified consist of the native produce of that country.

Thenius understands the words of an armed escort, which may well have been necessary considering the countries through which she passed, and the treasures she carried. It would also be quite in the spirit of the age that the queen should be escorted by a band of her soldiers. But it is not so certain that this idea was in the historian's mind], <span class="cmt_word">with</span> [not in Hebrews] <span class="cmt_word">camels</span> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-1.htm">2 Chronicles 9:1</a> has "<span class="accented">and</span> camels." But the word is here explicative of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span> preceding (Keil). It does not, however, decide against an armed force, as camels would be in any case required. The camel was a familiar object to the Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-3.htm">Exodus 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-4.htm">Leviticus 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-7.htm">Deuteronomy 14:7</a>, etc.); but such a  procession as this would create great astonishment in Jerusalem, and we may imagine how the people would line the bazaars as she passed, and the acclamations with which they would greet the queen (cf. 1:40; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>) and her swart attendants] <span class="cmt_word">that bare spices</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">balsams</span>; hence spices generally; LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-6.htm">Exodus 25:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-28.htm">Exodus 35:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-22.htm">Ezekiel 27:22</a>.

Gold is not now found in Arabia, nor are there any traces of gold mines; but Strabo and Diodorus both state that it <span class="accented">was</span> found there, and, according to the latter, in nuggets of considerable size (Dict. Bib. 1. p. 707). It is quite possible, however, that much of the "gold of Arabia" came to its emporiums from other lands. This particular present was doubtless brought by the queen because she had heard of the extensive use made of it by Solomon, and of the enormous quantities he required. "Strabo relates that the Sabeans were enormously wealthy, and used gold and silver in a most lavish manner in their furniture, their utensils, and even on the walls, doors, and roofs of their houses" (Rawlinson)] <span class="cmt_word">and precious stones</span> [the onyx, emerald, and turquoise are still found in Arabia, and in former times the variety was apparently much greater (Plin., Nat.

Both verses point back to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1-4</a> (viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-24.htm">1 Kings 9:24</a> to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-25.htm">1 Kings 9:25</a> to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-2.htm">1 Kings 3:2-4</a>), and show how the incongruities which existed at the commencement of Solomon's reign were removed by his buildings. When Solomon married Pharaoh's daughter, he brought her into the city of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>), until he should have finished his palace and built her a house of her own within it. After this building was completed, he had her brought up from the city of David into it. &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, came up, inasmuch as the palace stood upon the loftier summit of Zion. &#1488;&#1498; is to be connected with &#1488;&#1494; which follows, in the sense of only or just as: as soon as Pharaoh's daughter had gone up into the house built for her, Solomon built Millo.<p>(Note: Nothing certain can be gathered from this notice as to the situation of this castle. The remark made by Thenius, to the effect that it must have joined that portion of the palace in which the harem was, rests upon the assumption that Millo was evidently intended to shelter the harem, - an assumption which cannot be raised into a probability, to say nothing of a certainty. The building of Millo immediately after the entrance of Pharaoh's daughter into the house erected for her, may have arisen from the fact that David (? Solomon - Tr.) could not undertake the fortification of Jerusalem by means of this castle till after his own palace was finished, because he had not the requisite labour at command for carrying on all these buildings at the same time.)</body></html>
