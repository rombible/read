Notice the difficulty of the case. To find out the true mother, he could not try which the child loved best, and therefore tried which loved the child best: the mother's sincerity will be tried, when the child is in danger. Let parents show their love to their children, especially by taking care of their souls, and snatching them as brands out of the burning. By this and other instances of the wisdom with which God endued him, Solomon had great reputation among his people. This was better to him than weapons of war; for this he was both feared and loved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Solomon determined to inaugurate his reign by a grand religious ceremonial at each of the two holy places which at this time divided between them the reverence of the Jews. Having completed the religious service at Gibeon, where was the tabernacle of the congregation, he proceeded to Jerusalem, and sacrificed before the ark of the covenant, which was in Mount Zion <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12</a>. A great feast naturally followed on a large sacrifice of peace-offerings. In these the sacrificer always partook of the flesh of the victim, and he was commanded to call in to the feast the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>.

His Judgment between Two Harlots.<p>16. Then came there two women&#8212;Eastern monarchs, who generally administer justice in person, at least in all cases of difficulty, often appeal to the principles of human nature when they are at a loss otherwise to find a clue to the truth or see clearly their way through a mass of conflicting testimony. The modern history of the East abounds with anecdotes of judicial cases, in which the decision given was the result of an experiment similar to this of Solomon upon the natural feelings of the contending parties.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">She arose at midnight, </span> when I was asleep, as she reasonably and truly concluded. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Took my son from beside me; </span> either because she really desired the comfort of a child, to be educated by her, and owned as hers; or because she would not be thought guilty of the child’s death, for which she knew not how severely Solomon would punish her. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">While thine handmaid slept; </span> as she might well know, because had she been awake, she had discovered and prevented her design. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And she arose at midnight,.... Perceiving what she had done, that she had overlaid her child, and it was dead; either through fear of punishment inflicted on persons thus negligent, or because of the disgrace of it, taking no more care of her child, she made use of the following stratagem: <p>and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept; this served to puzzle the cause, for how could she know what she did when she was asleep? this she could not prove, it was only conjecture: <p>and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom; where she found it in the morning; but still what proof was there that it was the other woman's, and not her own, that lay dead in her bosom? <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And she arose at midnight, and <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.</span><p>(l) She stole the living child to avoid both the shame and punishment.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_kings/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">and laid it in her bosom</span>] It is not easy to account for the action of this woman. We need not however suppose her to have been possessed of very fine feelings, as indeed her after-behaviour shews. But it is somewhat more than unnatural to adopt such a scheme as this described here at a moment’s notice. It may be that she was chiefly moved by anxiety to preserve her own health, which would be imperilled through the sudden loss of the babe which she was meant to nurse.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she arose at midnight</span> [rather, in the middle, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, dead of the night.
