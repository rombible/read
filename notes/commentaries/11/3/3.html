Solomon was a wise man, a rich man, a great man; yet the brightest praise of him, is that which is the character of all the saints, even the poorest, He loved the Lord. Where God sows plentifully, he expects to reap accordingly; and those that truly love God and his worship, will not grudge the expenses of their religion. We must never think that wasted which is laid out in the service of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The word "only" introduces a contrast. The writer means to say that there was one exception to the flourishing condition of things which he has been describing, namely, that "the people sacrificed in high-places." (Compare the next verse.) The Law did not forbid "high-places" directly, but only by implication. It required the utter destruction of all the high-places which had been polluted by idolatrous rites <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>; and the injunction to offer sacrifices nowhere except at the door of the tabernacle <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-3.htm">Leviticus 17:3-5</a> was an indirect prohibition of them, or, at least, of the use which the Israelites made of them; but there was some real reason to question whether this was a command intended to come into force until the "place" was chosen "where the Lord would cause His name to dwell." (See <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-11.htm">Deuteronomy 12:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-14.htm">Deuteronomy 12:14</a>.) The result was that high-places were used for the worship of Yahweh, from the time of the Judges downward <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-16.htm">Judges 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-10.htm">1 Samuel 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-9.htm">1 Samuel 13:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-35.htm">1 Samuel 14:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-5.htm">1 Samuel 16:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26</a>, with an entire unconsciousness of guilt on the part of those who used them. And God so far overlooked this ignorance that He accepted the worship thus offered Him, as appears from the vision vouchsafed to Solomon on this occasion. There were two reasons for the prohibition of high-places; first, the danger of the old idolatry creeping back if the old localities were retained for worship; and, secondly, the danger to the unity of the nation if there should be more than one legitimate religious center. The existence of the worship at high places did, in fact, facilitate the division of the kingdom. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. And Solomon loved the Lord&#8212;This declaration, illustrated by what follows, affords undoubted evidence of the young king's piety; nor is the word "only," which prefaces the statement, to be understood as introducing a qualifying circumstance that reflected any degree of censure upon him. The intention of the sacred historian is to describe the generally prevailing mode of worship before the temple was built. The<p>high places were altars erected on natural or artificial eminences, probably from the idea that men were brought nearer to the Deity. They had been used by the patriarchs, and had become so universal among the heathen that they were almost identified with idolatry. They were prohibited in the law (Le 17:3, 4; De 12:13, 14; Jer 7:31; Eze 6:3, 4; Ho 10:8). But, so long as the tabernacle was migratory and the means for the national worship were merely provisional, the worship on those high places was tolerated. Hence, as accounting for their continuance, it is expressly stated (1Ki 3:2) that God had not yet chosen a permanent and exclusive place for his worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And, </span> or, <span class="ital">yet</span>, although he mistook and miscarried himself in the matter of high places, yet in the general his heart was right with God, and he both <span class="ital">loved</span> him with inward affection, and walked with him in outward conversation and worship. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the statutes of David, </span> i.e. according to the statutes or commands of God, which are here called the statutes of David, not only because they were so freely chosen, and heartily loved, and diligently practised by David, but also because the observation of them was so earnestly pressed upon Solomon, and fortified with David’s authority and command: see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/2-2.htm" title="I go the way of all the earth: be you strong therefore, and show yourself a man;...">1 Kings 2:2-4</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-8.htm" title="Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.">1 Chronicles 28:8</a>,9</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Solomon loved the Lord,....
