It may probably have followed on the denunciation of judgment; and Elijah’s retirement to Cherith and Zarephath may have been a means of escape from it. If Elijah’s oft-repeated phrase, “I, even I, alone remain,” is to be taken literally, Obadiah’s merciful interposition must have availed only for a time, or have simply given opportunity of escape.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-4.htm" title="For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)">1 Kings 18:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">When Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord — </span>The name of prophets was not only given to such as were endowed with an extraordinary spirit of prophecy, but to such ministers of religion as devoted themselves to the service of God, in preaching, praying, and praising him.

The priests and the Levites were gone to Judah and Jerusalem, 2Ch 11:13,14, but instead of them God raised up prophets, who read and expounded the word. They probably were from the schools of the prophets, first set up by Samuel. They had not the spirit of prophecy as Elijah, but taught the people to keep close to the God of Israel. These Jezebel sought to destroy. The few that escaped death were forced to hide themselves. God has his remnant among all sorts, high and low; and that faith, fear, and love of his name, which are the fruits of the Holy Spirit, will be accepted through the Redeemer. See how wonderfully God raises up friends for his ministers and people, for their shelter in difficult times. Bread and water were now scarce, yet Obadiah will find enough for God's prophets, to keep them alive. Ahab's care was not to lose all the beasts; but he took no care about his soul, not to lose that. He took pains to seek grass, but none to seek the favour of God; fencing against the effect, but not inquiring how to remove the cause. But it bodes well with a people, when God calls his ministers to stand forth, and show themselves. And we may the better endure the bread of affliction, while our eyes see our teachers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We have no details of Jezebel's deed of blood.

But no doubt the larger number whom Jezebel cut off were ‘the sons of the prophets,’ those who belonged to the schools of the prophets, which we learn from 2 Kings 2. were both numerous and largely frequented. It was a hundred of these men whom Obadiah saved in the time of persecution. The story of Jezebel’s butchery is not given us, but it is alluded to here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/19-10.htm" title="And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away....">1 Kings 19:10-14</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For it was so, when Jezebel cut off</span> <span class="cmt_word">the prophets of the Lord</span> [Our author now instances a proof of Obadiah's devotion. The incident to which he refers is otherwise unknown to us, nor can we refer it with certainty to its proper place in the history. But it is extremely probable that this work of extermination was begun as an act of reprisals for the drought denounced by Elijah. Ver. 13 almost implies that it had taken place during his absence. We see here, consequently, an additional reason for his flight (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-2.htm">1 Kings 19:2</a>). These "prophets" are the same as those elsewhere called the "<span class="accented">sons</span> of the prophets, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, members of the prophetic schools; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-3.htm">2 Kings 2:3, 5, 7</a>, etc.] <span class="cmt_word">that Obadiah took an</span> <span class="cmt_word">hundred prophets</span> [This would lead us to suppose that the great majority escaped.

That we find so large a number still in the land, notwithstanding the exodus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-16.htm">2 Chronicles 11:16</a>), and the steady growth of impiety, shows that God had not left Himself without witnesses], <span class="cmt_word">and hid them by fifty</span> [Keil would insert a second <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5d7;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> as do some MSS.

Similarly in ver. 13. What is the force of the article here it is somewhat difficult to say. It has been suggested that these caves were in the sides of Mount Carmel; there are large caves under the western cliffs (Stanley); more than two thousand, according to others; "often of great length and extremely tortuous" (Dic. Bib. 1. p. 278); but this is mere guesswork, as Palestine, being of limestone formation, abounds in caverns. See Stanley, S. and P. pp. 151, 52. From the earliest times we find men - outlaws and the like - taking up their abode therein.

Probably the division into two companies was partly for the sake of security (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-8.htm">Genesis 22:8</a>), and partly for the sake of convenience.

[It is to be observed, as bearing on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-3.htm">1 Kings 17:3-6</a>, that these hundred prophets, though preserved by the special providence of God, were nevertheless maintained through human agency and by natural means. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Lord heard this prayer: the boy came to life again; whereupon Elijah gave him back to his mother.</body></html>
