Mount Carmel—rightly called “the park,” well planted and watered, of central Palestine—is a limestone ridge, with deep ravines thickly wooded, running north-west for about twelve miles from the central hills of Manasseh, so as to form the south side of the bay of Ptolemais, and almost to reach the sea, leaving, however, a space round which the southern armies constantly poured into the plain of Jezreel. It varies from 600 feet to 1,700 feet in height. Near its higher eastern extremity there is a place still called <span class= "ital">El Maharrakah, </span>“the burning,” in view of the plain and city of Jezreel, and commanding from one point a glimpse of the sea, which is the traditional (and highly probable) scene of Elijah’s sacrifice. Carmel is previously mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-26.htm" title="And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal; and reaches to Carmel westward, and to Shihorlibnath;">Joshua 19:26</a>, as falling to Asher, and the existence of the altar of the Lord shows that, as was natural, it was made one of the “high places,” and, indeed, it appears to have been known as such even to the heathen. In the prophetic writings it is referred to as proverbial for its luxuriant pasturage and beauty. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-9.htm" title="The earth mourns and languishes: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits.">Isaiah 33:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-26.htm" title="I beheld, and, see, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger.">Jeremiah 4:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-2.htm" title="And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.">Amos 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-3.htm" title="And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out there; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, there will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them:">Amos 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-6.htm" title="How fair and how pleasant are you, O love, for delights!">Song of Solomon 7:6</a>.)

Its thick jungles of copse and numerous dwarf-oaks and olives, would furnish abundant wood for his intended sacrifice. Here was a perennial fountain; and here again an ancient "altar of the Lord" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-30.htm">1 Kings 18:30</a>, belonging probably to the old times of non-idolatrous high-place worship - perhaps an erection of one of the patriarchs. On the one hand, there would be a view of the Mediterranean, from where the first sign of rain was likely to come, and on the other of Jezreel, the residence of the court at the time, with its royal palace and its idol-temples, so that the intended trial would take place in the sight (so to speak) of the proud queen and her minions.<p>The prophets of Baal - The priests of Baal are so called not so much because they claimed a power of foretelling the future, as because they were "teachers" of the false religion, and more especially because they stand here in antagonism to the "prophet of the Lord," with whom they are about to contend.<p>The prophets of the groves, four hundred - Rather, "of the grove" - the prophets, or priests, attached to the "grove" - &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1492;  'a&#774;she&#770;ra&#772;h - which Ahab had made, probably at Jezreel (marginal reference). The number 400 seems to have been one especially affected by Ahab. We again find 400 prophets at the close of his reign <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-6.htm">1 Kings 22:6</a>.

No doubt but more discourse passed between Ahab and Elijah, though not recorded, before he made this motion to him; it is very probable, that after some dispute between them, who was the true God, and about idolatry, as the cause of want of rain, Elijah proposed to the king what he afterwards did to the people, to which he could not object; and being desirous of gratifying his curiosity, and especially of having rain, which the prophet might promise him in the issue of this affair, he agreed unto it; and therefore Elijah desired that all Israel might be convened, that it might be openly and publicly done, and to the conviction and reformation of them, which was what was chiefly designed; and he chose Carmel, a mountain in the tribe of Issachar, well situated for the people that came from all parts; and the rather this than Samaria, that he might meet with no obstruction from Jezebel, and from whence: he might be able to see the rain when coming, as he did. Of this mountain; see Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-18.htm">Jeremiah 46:18</a>, to which may be added, the description of it by Mr. Sandys (n). <p>"Mount Carmel stretcheth from east to west, and hath its uttermost basis washed with the sea; steepest towards the north, and of an indifferent altitude; rich in vines and olives when farmed, and abounding with several sorts of fruits and herbs, both medicinal and fragrant, though now much overgrown with woods and shrubs of sweet savour.'' <p>From the following solemn transaction at it, it seems in later times, to have become sacred, and was very venerable with the Heathens; from this mountain, a deity with them had the name of Carmel, and was worshipped here, without an image or a temple, only had an altar erected for it, in imitation of the God of Israel, worshipped here in like manner; here Vespasian sacrificed to this deity, assisted by the priest of it, Basilides, as Tacitus (o) relates; Suetonius (p) also makes mention of this deity, and of Vespasian's consulting its oracle, which gave him hopes of obtaining the empire; and from hence, in Popish times, there were an order of friars called Carmelites, instituted in the year 1180, pretending to be the successors of the children of the prophets Elijah left there: <p>and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty; who are supposed to be dispersed in the various parts of the kingdom, to teach and practise the worship of Baal, and encourage and spread it in the nation: <p>and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table; for it seems there were now more groves than that one Ahab first made, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-33.htm">1 Kings 16:33</a>, for which such numbers were appointed to attend, and which, perhaps, were near Samaria, since they ate at Jezebel's table, and were a sort of domestic chaplains of her's. "Asheroth", we render "groves", the learned Selden (q) takes to be Ashtoreth, or Ashtareth, or Astarte, the goddess of the Zidonians, for whom, and so for these prophets, Jezebel might have a peculiar respect, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-5.htm">1 Kings 11:5</a>. <p>(n) Travels, l. 3. p. 158.

Perhaps Elijah chose the place because there was an altar there, which had been used for the worship of Jehovah, but was now thrown down.

Jezebel had introduced the female as well as the male divinity, so that nothing might be wanting to the complete observance of the worship to which she had been trained at home.

Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-1.htm">1 Samuel 25:1-5</a>. It is "the park of Palestine." It is indebted for this name to the luxuriant vegetation - "the excellency of Carmel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-2.htm">Isaiah 35:2</a>) - which clothes its southern slopes (Porter, p. 371; Stanley, S. and P. pp. 352-54, and App. p. 14; Van de Velde, 1. pp. 317, 318). It is now generally called <span class="accented">Mar</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, Lord or Saint) <span class="accented">Elyas</span>, after the great prophet. No one who has seen the locality can have any doubts as to which part of the mountain was the scene of the sacrifice, or can fail to be struck with the singular fitness of the place to be the theatre of this thrilling history. Carmel is rather a ridge than a mountain, some twelve miles in length. Its western (or strictly N.N.W.) extremity is a bold headland, some 600 feet in height, which dips almost directly into the waters of the Mediterranean. Its highest point, 1728 feet above the sea level, is about four miles from its eastern extremity, which, at an elevation of 1600 feet, rises like a wall from the great plain of Esdraelon. It is at this point, there can be no question, we are to place the scene of the burnt sacrifice. The identification has only been effected in comparatively recent days (1852), but it is beyond dispute. Not only does the Arab name which it bears <span class="accented">- El Murahkah</span>, "<span class="accented">the</span> <span class="accented">Burning</span>," or "<span class="accented">Sacrifice"</span> <span class="accented">-</span> afford striking witness to the identity, but the situation and surroundings adapt themselves with such wonderful precision to the requirements of the narrative as to leave no reasonable doubt in the mind. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> it is a sort of natural platform, or pulpit, raised 1000 feet above the adjoining plain, and therefore well calculated to afford a view of the proceedings, or at least of the descent of the Holy Fire, to spectators of all Israel. The flame would probably be seen by Jezebel in her palace at Jezreel. This eminence is visible from Nazareth, some twenty miles away. "There is not a more conspicuous spot on all Carmel than the abrupt, rocky height of El Murahkah, shooting up so suddenly on the east" (Van de Velde, 1. pp. 322, 323). "The summit...  commands the last view of the sea behind and the first  view of the great plain in front" (Stanley). In fact, it was in its way just as well adapted for the solemn vindication of the law which took place there as <span class="accented">Jebel Sufsafeh</span> was for the giving of the law. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> A sort of plateau near the summit - the table land where the altars were built, etc. - would accommodate a vast number of spectators (ver. 21). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> There is a spring of water close at hand - less than 100 yards distant - and a spring which is said to flow even in the driest seasons, which would supply the water of which we read in vers. 4, 33-35. Josephus (Ant. 8:13, 5) says it came from the fountain. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The sea, though not visible from the plateau itself, is seen from a point some 300 feet higher, a detail which accords admirably with the account of vers. 42-44. It may be added that the place is still held sacred by the Druses, and reverenced by "Jews, Christians, Moslems, and Bedouin as the site of these miracles of Elijah" (Thomson). The traveller, consequently, cannot doubt for a moment, as he stands on the table-land of <span class="accented">El</span> <span class="accented">Murahkah</span> and looks across the great plain to Jezreel and the heights of Galilee and Samaria, that he is on the very spot sanctified by the descent of the heavenly fire. It should be added, as explaining the selection of Carmel by Elijah, that its situation is central end convenient; that it is near the sea, from whence the rain clouds would come; that it is easy of access from Jezreel; and that it was not only a holy place from earlier times (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-23.htm">2 Kings 4:23</a>), but also had its altar of Jehovah, an altar, no doubt, in constant use when the people "sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places," but which had in later days fallen into neglect, and was now broken down. It was every way, therefore, a <span class="accented">most appropriate</span> locality for the public vindication of the despised and outraged law of God.

From the fear expressed by Obadiah that the Spirit of Jehovah might suddenly carry the prophet to some unknown place, Seb. Schmidt and others have inferred that in the earlier history of Elijah there had occurred some cases of this kind of sudden transportation, though they have not been handed down; but the anxiety expressed by Obadiah might very well have sprung from the fact, that after Elijah had announced the coming drought to Ahab, he disappeared, and, notwithstanding all the inquiries instituted by the king, was nowhere to be found. And since he was not carried off miraculously then (compare the &#1500;&#1498; and &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498;, "get thee hence" and "he went," in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-3.htm">1 Kings 17:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-5.htm">1 Kings 17:5</a>), there is all the less ground for imagining cases of this kind in the intermediate time, when he was hidden from his enemies. The subsequent translation of Elijah to heaven (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11-12</a>), and the miraculous carrying away of Philip from the chamberlain of Mauritania (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-39.htm">Acts 8:39</a>), do not warrant any such assumption; and still less the passage which Clericus quotes from Ezekiel (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-14.htm">Ezekiel 3:14</a>), because the carrying of Ezekiel through the air, which is mentioned here, only happened in vision and not in external reality. If Obadiah had known of any actual occurrence of this kind, he would certainly have stated it more clearly as a more striking vindication of his fear.</body></html>
