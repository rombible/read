The priests and the Levites were gone to Judah and Jerusalem, 2Ch 11:13,14, but instead of them God raised up prophets, who read and expounded the word. They probably were from the schools of the prophets, first set up by Samuel. They had not the spirit of prophecy as Elijah, but taught the people to keep close to the God of Israel. These Jezebel sought to destroy. The few that escaped death were forced to hide themselves. God has his remnant among all sorts, high and low; and that faith, fear, and love of his name, which are the fruits of the Holy Spirit, will be accepted through the Redeemer. See how wonderfully God raises up friends for his ministers and people, for their shelter in difficult times. Bread and water were now scarce, yet Obadiah will find enough for God's prophets, to keep them alive. Ahab's care was not to lose all the beasts; but he took no care about his soul, not to lose that. He took pains to seek grass, but none to seek the favour of God; fencing against the effect, but not inquiring how to remove the cause. But it bodes well with a people, when God calls his ministers to stand forth, and show themselves. And we may the better endure the bread of affliction, while our eyes see our teachers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There is no nation ... - This is expressed in the style of Oriental hyperbole. What Obadiah means is: "there is no nation nor kingdom, of those over which he has influence, whither the king has not sent." He could scarcely, for example, have exacted an oath from such countries as Egypt or Syria of Damascus. But Ahab may have been powerful enough to expect an oath from the neighboring Hittite, Moabite, and Edomite tribes, perhaps even from Ethbaal his father-in-law, and the kings of Hamath and Arpad. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7-16. Obadiah was in the way &#8230; Elijah met him&#8212;Deeming it imprudent to rush without previous intimation into Ahab's presence, the prophet solicited Obadiah to announce his return to Ahab. The commission, with a delicate allusion to the perils he had already encountered in securing others of God's servants, was, in very touching terms, declined, as unkind and peculiarly hazardous. But Elijah having dispelled all the apprehensions entertained about the Spirit's carrying him away, Obadiah undertook to convey the prophet's message to Ahab and solicit an interview. But Ahab, bent on revenge, or impatient for the appearance of rain, went himself to meet Elijah.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the Lord? how I hid one hundred men of the Lord's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water? See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>, this he said not in a way of ostentation, but to show that it would be very ungenerous and ungrateful, as well as impolitic, to sacrifice such a friend at court to the Lord's prophets as he had been, and might still continue to be. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_kings/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">Was it not told my lord</span>] Obadiah’s thought seems to be that Elijah could believe nothing but evil of one who was in the household of Ahab. So by a question he tries to place himself in his true light, and to excuse himself at the same time, from being sent on so perilous an errand. The conduct of Obadiah in saving the prophets can hardly have been known to Ahab or his wife. But it would be likely to come to the knowledge of Elijah, as he would be a companion and friend of those who were rescued from Jezebel’s fury.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the Lord how I hid an hundred men of</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">from</span>] <span class="cmt_word">the Lord's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?</span> [Stanley happily calls Obadiah "the Sebastian of this Jewish Diocletian."] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Elijah met Obadiah on this expedition, and told him to announce his coming to the king.</body></html>
