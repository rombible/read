Observe the ruin of the family of Jeroboam; no word of God shall fall to the ground. Divine threatenings are not designed merely to terrify. Ungodly men execute the just judgments of God upon each other. But in the midst of dreadful sins and this apparent confusion, the Lord carries on his own plan: when it is fully completed, the glorious justice, wisdom, truth, and mercy therein displayed, shall be admired and adored through all the ages of eternity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sacred historian now gives an account of the contemporary kings of Israel, beginning with Nadab, who ascended the throne in Asa's second year, and concluding with Ahab, in whose fourth year Asa died.

Ijon (&#1506;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;) is to be sought for in all probability in Tell Dibbin, on the eastern border of Merj Ayun; and in Ajun, although Ajun is written with Aleph, the name Ijon is probably preserved, since the situation of this Tell seems thoroughly adapted for a fortress on the northern border of Israel (vid., Robinson, Bibl. Res. p. 375, and Van de Velde, Mem. p. 322). Dan is the present Tell el Kadi; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>. Abel-Beth-Maachah, the present Abil el Kamh, to the north-west of Lake Huleh (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-14.htm">2 Samuel 20:14</a>). "All Chinneroth" is the district of Chinnereth, the tract of land on the western shore of the Lake of Gennesareth (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-35.htm">Joshua 19:35</a>). &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1504; &#1506;&#1500;, together with all the land of Naphtali (for this meaning of &#1506;&#1500; fo gninaem  compare the Comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-12.htm">Genesis 32:12</a>). The cities named were the principal fortresses of the land of Naphtali, with which the whole of the country round was also smitten, i.e., laid waste.</body></html>
