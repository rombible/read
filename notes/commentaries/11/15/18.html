The Ben-hadad of the text is the grandson of Hezion, who must be the Rezon of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-23.htm" title="And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:">1Kings 11:23</a>. Already, as we gather from the next verse, there had been leagues between Syria and Judah in the preceding reign. Now it is clear that Baasha had attempted to supersede these by a closer league—possibly, like Pekah in later times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/16-5.htm" title="Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.">2Kings 16:5-6</a>), desiring to strengthen and secure himself against invasion by the subjugation of Judah. Asa naturally resolved to bribe Ben-hadad by presents to prefer the old tie to the new; but he went beyond this, and proposed a combined attack on Israel, for the first time calling in a heathen power against his “brethren, the children of Israel.” It was an expedient which, though it succeeded for its immediate purpose, yet both as a desperate policy and an unfaithfulness to the brotherhood, which, in spite of separation and corruption, still bound the two kingdoms in the covenant of God with Abraham, deserved and received prophetic rebuke. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/16-7.htm" title="And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD your God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand.">2Chronicles 16:7-9</a>.) Just so Isaiah, in the days of Ahaz and Hezekiah, denounced the vain trust in confederacies with the neighbouring nations and alliance with Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/30-1.htm" title="Woe to the rebellious children, said the LORD, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin:">Isaiah 30:1-17</a>).<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-18.htm" title="Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelled at Damascus, saying,">1 Kings 15:18</a></span>. <span class="ital">Asa took all the silver and gold that were left — </span>Which either Shishak had left, or Abijam or Asa or others, of both Israel or Judah, had dedicated; which probably was not inconsiderable, because Asa had got great spoils from Zarah, (2 Chronicles 14.) and he, and his numerous and prosperous people, did at this time express a great zeal for the house and worship of God. <span class="ital">Sent them — </span>Wherein he committed three great faults, among many others; 1st, He alienated things consecrated to God, without necessity. 2d, He did this out of distrust of that God whose power and goodness he had lately experienced. 3d, He did this for an ill intent, to hire him to the breach of his league and covenant with Baasha, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-19.htm" title="There is a league between me and you, and between my father and your father: behold, I have sent to you a present of silver and gold; come and break your league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.">1 Kings 15:19</a>,) and to take away part of that land which by right, and the special gift of God, belonged to the Israelites.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:9-24 Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord. That is right indeed which is so in God's eyes. Asa's times were times of reformation. He removed that which was evil; there reformation begins, and a great deal he found to do. When Asa found idolatry in the court, he rooted it out thence. Reformation must begin at home. Asa honours and respects his mother; he loves her well, but he loves God better. Those that have power are happy when thus they have hearts to use it well. We must not only cease to do evil, but learn to do well; not only cast away the idols of our iniquity, but dedicate ourselves and our all to God's honour and glory. Asa was cordially devoted to the service of God, his sins not arising from presumption. But his league with Benhadad arose from unbelief. Even true believers find it hard, in times of urgent danger, to trust in the Lord with all their heart. Unbelief makes way for carnal policy, and thus for one sin after another. Unbelief has often led Christians to call in the help of the Lord's enemies in their contests with their brethren; and some who once shone brightly, have thus been covered with a dark cloud towards the end of their days.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Left - Or, according to another reading, "found." The wealthy condition of the temple treasury is sufficiently indicated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-15.htm">1 Kings 15:15</a>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-18.htm">2 Chronicles 15:18</a>.<p>Asa's conduct in calling Benhadad to his aid, condemned by the seer Hanani <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7</a>, cannot, of course, be justified; but there was much to excuse it. An alliance, it appears, had existed between Abijam and Tabrimon, Benhadad's father <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-19.htm">1 Kings 15:19</a> - an alliance which may have helped Abijam to gain his great victory over Jeroboam and achieve his subsequent conquests <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-17.htm">2 Chronicles 13:17-20</a>. This had been brought to an end by Baasha, who had succeeded in inducing Benhadad to enter into a league with him. It was only natural that Asa should endeavor to break up this league; and, politically speaking, he had a full right to go further, and obtain, if he could, the support of the Syrian troops for himself. The Israelites had set the example of calling in a foreign power, when Jeroboam obtained the aid of Shishak.<p>To Benhadad - On the probable succession of the Damascene kings, and on the meaning of the name Hadad, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-23.htm">1 Kings 11:23</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18-20. Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the &#8230; house of the Lord&#8212;Asa's religious character is now seen to decline. He trusted not in the Lord (2Ch 16:7). In this emergency Asa solicited the powerful aid of the king of Damascene-Syria; and to bribe him to break off his alliance with Baasha, he transmitted to him the treasure lying in the temple and palace. The Syrian mercenaries were gained. Instances are to be found, both in the ancient and modern history of the East, of the violation of treaties equally sudden and unscrupulous, through the presentation of some tempting bribe. Ben-hadad poured an army into the northern provinces of Israel, and having captured some cities in Galilee, on the borders of Syria, compelled Baasha to withdraw from Ramah back within his own territories.<p>Ben-hadad&#8212;(See on [315]1Ki 11:14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All the silver and the gold that were left; </span> these poor remainders, which either Shishak had left at that time, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-26.htm" title="And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.">1 Kings 14:26</a></span>, or Abijam, or Asa, or others, both of Israel and Judah, had dedicated; which probably was not inconsiderable, because Asa had got great spoils from Zerah, <span class="bld"> 2Ch 14</span>, and he and his numerous and prosperous people did at this time express a great zeal for the house and worship of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Asa sent them to Ben-hadad; </span> wherein he committed three great faults, amongst many others.

We cannot always determine whether the names of these kings are merely significant titles, or true names. ‘Hadad’ was a Syrian god, perhaps the sun-god, and Ben-hadad, ‘son of Hadad’ may mean one devoted to Hadad’s worship. So ‘Tab-rimmon’ signifies ‘good is Rimmon’; Rimmon being another Syrian divinity (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-18.htm" title="In this thing the LORD pardon your servant, that when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon your servant in this thing.">2 Kings 5:18</a>). This is much more likely to be a personal name than Ben-hadad. The war which Ben-hadad now began against Israel appears to have been continued in the days of Ahab. See below <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-1.htm" title="And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.">1 Kings 20:1</a>.

It is so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-16.htm">Deuteronomy 29:16</a>. &#1502;&#1508;&#1500;&#1510;&#1514;, formido, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1509;, terrere, timere, hence an idol as an object of fear, and not pudendum, a shameful image, as Movers (Phniz. i. p. 571), who follows the Rabbins, explains it, understanding thereby a Phallus as a symbol of the generative and fructifying power of nature. With regard to the character of this idol, nothing further can be determined than that it was of wood, and possibly a wooden column like the &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>). "But the high places departed not," i.e., were not abolished. By the &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; we are not to understand, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-12.htm">1 Kings 15:12</a>, altars of high places dedicated to idols, but unlawful altars to Jehovah. It is so in the other passages in which this formula recurs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-24.htm">1 Kings 22:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-4.htm">2 Kings 12:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-4.htm">2 Kings 14:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-4.htm">2 Kings 15:4</a>; and the parallel passages <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-17.htm">2 Chronicles 15:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-33.htm">2 Chronicles 20:33</a>). The apparent discrepancy between the last-mentioned passages and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-2.htm">2 Chronicles 14:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-4.htm">2 Chronicles 14:4</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-6.htm">2 Chronicles 17:6</a>, may be solved very simply on the supposition that the kings (Asa and Jehoshaphat) did indeed abolish the altars on the high places, but did not carry their reforms in the nation thoroughly out; and not by distinguishing between the bamoth dedicated to Jehovah and those dedicated to idols, as Thenius, Bertheau, and Caspari, with many of the earlier commentators, suppose. For although <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-2.htm">2 Chronicles 14:2</a> is very favourable to this solution, since both &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; and &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512; dna &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493; &#1502;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; are mentioned there, it does not accord with <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-6.htm">2 Chronicles 17:6</a>, where &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; cannot be merely idolatrous altars dedicated to the Canaanitish Baal, but unquestionably refer to the unlawful altars of Jehovah, or at any rate include them. Moreover, the next clause in the passage before us, "nevertheless Asa's heart was wholly given to the Lord," shows that the expression &#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1488; &#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; nois does not mean that the king allowed the unlawful Jehovah-bamoth to remain, but simply that, notwithstanding his fidelity to Jehovah, the bamoth did not depart, so that he was unable to carry the abolition of them thoroughly out.</body></html>
