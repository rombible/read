And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.">1Kings 15:7</a>, appears simply to mean that the old hostile relations remained, combined with, perhaps, some border war; for it is expressly said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-1.htm" title="So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.

That is right indeed which is so in God's eyes. Asa's times were times of reformation. He removed that which was evil; there reformation begins, and a great deal he found to do. When Asa found idolatry in the court, he rooted it out thence. Reformation must begin at home. Asa honours and respects his mother; he loves her well, but he loves God better. Those that have power are happy when thus they have hearts to use it well. We must not only cease to do evil, but learn to do well; not only cast away the idols of our iniquity, but dedicate ourselves and our all to God's honour and glory. Asa was cordially devoted to the service of God, his sins not arising from presumption. But his league with Benhadad arose from unbelief. Even true believers find it hard, in times of urgent danger, to trust in the Lord with all their heart. Unbelief makes way for carnal policy, and thus for one sin after another. Unbelief has often led Christians to call in the help of the Lord's enemies in their contests with their brethren; and some who once shone brightly, have thus been covered with a dark cloud towards the end of their days.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Baasha became king of Israel in the third year of Asa <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-33.htm">1 Kings 15:33</a>.

In the fifteenth year of his reign, however, the king of Israel commenced hostilities against him, and, invading his kingdom, erected a strong fortress at Ramah, which was near Gibeah, and only six Roman miles from Jerusalem. Afraid lest his subjects might quit his kingdom and return to the worship of their fathers, he wished to cut off all intercourse between the two nations. Ramah stood on an eminence overhanging a narrow ravine which separated Israel from Judah, and therefore he took up a hostile position in that place.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> So long as they two lived and reigned together; which is not so to be understood, as if there were a solemn and declared war continuing all that time, (for Asa was quiet in a great measure for his first ten years, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-1.htm" title="So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.

So Asa was king all through Baasha’s reign. Hence ‘all their days’ implies the whole of Baasha’s reign.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days</span> [This statement must be compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-1.htm">2 Chronicles 14:1, 6</a>, from which we gather that during the first ten years of Asa's reign there cannot have been <span class="accented">war</span>, properly so called, between them. Indeed, it would seem from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-19.htm">2 Chronicles 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-1.htm">2 Chronicles 16:1</a>, that it was not until the 36th year of Asa's reign that it first broke out. But these numbers have clearly not escaped corruption (see note there), as at the date last mentioned Baasha must have been dead (cf. ver. 33 below). It is probable that war is to be taken here, as elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-30.htm">1 Kings 14:30</a>), in the sense of hostility, and in any case we have here another instance of the hyperbolical habit of the Eastern mind.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Asa reigned forty-one years. "The name of his mother was Maacah, the daughter of Absalom." This notice, which agrees verbatim with <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a>, cannot mean that Abijam had his own mother for a wife; though Thenius finds this meaning in the passage, and then proceeds to build up conjectures concerning emendations of the text. We must rather explain it, as Ephr. Syr., the Rabbins, and others have done, as signifying that Maacah, the mother of Abijam, continued during Asa's reign to retain the post of queen-mother or &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, i.e., sultana valide, till Asa deposed her on account of her idolatry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>), probably because Asa's own mother had died at an early age.</body></html>
