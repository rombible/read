The constant succession of ephemeral dynasties stands in striking contrast with the unchanged royalty of the house of David, resting on the promise of God.<span class= "bld"><p>Gibbethon</span>—a Levitical town in the territory of Dan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-44.htm" title="And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath,">Joshua 19:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-23.htm" title="And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs, Gibbethon with her suburbs,">Joshua 21:23</a>), probably, like other places in that region, still held by the Philistines till their subjugation by David. The text here implies a revolt of the Philistines against the enfeebled power of Israel, and the occupation of Gibbethon, commanding a pass from the plain of Sharon to the interior. The siege must have been fruitless, at least of any permanent result; for twenty-six years after we find Gibbethon still in the hands of the enemy.

But it appears, Nadab was now endeavouring to recover it out of their hands, as of right belonging to him; and here, in the midst of his army, did Baasha, with others, conspire against him, and kill him: and so little interest had he in the affections of his people, that his army not only did not avenge his death, but chose his murderer his successor. Whether Baasha did this upon a personal pique against Nadab, or to be revenged on the house of Jeroboam for some affront received from them; or whether under pretence of freeing his country from the tyranny of an ill prince; or whether purely from a principle of ambition, to make way for himself to the throne, doth not appear; but having slain him, <span class="ital">he reigned in his stead.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:25-34 During the single reign of Asa in Judah, the government of Israel was in six or seven different hands.

Ungodly men execute the just judgments of God upon each other.
