David's family was continued as a lamp in Jerusalem, to maintain the true worship of God there, when the light of Divine truth was extinguished in all other places. The Lord has still taken care of his cause, while those who ought to have been serviceable thereto have lived and perished in their sins. The Son of David will still continue a light to his church, to establish it in truth and righteousness to the end of time. There are two kinds of fulfilling the law, one legal, the other by the gospel. Legal is, when men do all things required in the law, and that by themselves. None ever thus fulfilled the law but Christ, and Adam before his fall. The gospel manner of fulfilling the law is, to believe in Christ who fulfilled the law for us, and to endeavour in the whole man to obey God in all his precepts. And this is accepted of God, as to all those that are in Christ. Thus David and others are said to fulfil the law.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The writer repeats what he had said in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-30.htm">1 Kings 14:30</a>, in order to remind the reader that Abijam inherited this war from his father. Abijam's war is described in marginal reference That the author of Kings gives none of its details is agreeable to his common practice in mere military matters. Thus he gives no details of Shishak's expedition, and omits Zerah's expedition altogether. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. for David's sake did the Lord his God give him a lamp&#8212;"A lamp" in one's house is an Oriental phrase for continuance of family name and prosperity.

If Abijam came to the throne in the 18th year of Jeroboam and reigned 3 years, his death would fall in the twenty-first year of Jeroboam, or if the three years of his reign were incomplete at the beginning and end it might occur, as is said immediately in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-9.htm" title="And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah.">1 Kings 15:9</a>, in the 20th year of Jeroboam.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David</span> [This fact alone should negative Lightfoot's theory as to his name; see note on 1 Kings 14:31]: <span class="cmt_word">and Ass his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="accented">The Reign of Asa</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Reign of Abijam (cf., <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13.htm">2 Chronicles 13</a>). - Abijam reigned three years, and his mother's name was Maacah, daughter (i.e., grand-daughter) of Absalom. We have the same in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-20.htm">2 Chronicles 11:20-21</a>; but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-2.htm">2 Chronicles 13:2</a> she is called Michajahu, daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. If &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; was without doubt Absalom, the well-known son of David, as we may infer from the fact that this name does not occur again in the Old Testament in connection with any other person, since Absalom had only one daughter, viz., Thamar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-27.htm">2 Samuel 14:27</a>), who was fifty years old when Solomon died, Maacah must have been a daughter of this Thamar, who had married Uriel of Gibeah, and therefore a grand-daughter of Absalom. This is sustained by Josephus (Ant. viii. 10, 1). The form of the name &#1502;&#1497;&#1499;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; is probably an error in copying for &#1502;&#1506;&#1499;&#1492;, as the name is also written in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-20.htm">2 Chronicles 11:20</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>, and not a different name, which Maacah assumed as queen, as Caspari supposes (Micha, p. 3, note 4). </body></html>
