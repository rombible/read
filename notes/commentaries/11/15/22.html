That is right indeed which is so in God's eyes. Asa's times were times of reformation. He removed that which was evil; there reformation begins, and a great deal he found to do. When Asa found idolatry in the court, he rooted it out thence. Reformation must begin at home. Asa honours and respects his mother; he loves her well, but he loves God better. Those that have power are happy when thus they have hearts to use it well. We must not only cease to do evil, but learn to do well; not only cast away the idols of our iniquity, but dedicate ourselves and our all to God's honour and glory. Asa was cordially devoted to the service of God, his sins not arising from presumption. But his league with Benhadad arose from unbelief. Even true believers find it hard, in times of urgent danger, to trust in the Lord with all their heart. Unbelief makes way for carnal policy, and thus for one sin after another. Unbelief has often led Christians to call in the help of the Lord's enemies in their contests with their brethren; and some who once shone brightly, have thus been covered with a dark cloud towards the end of their days.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Geba, situated opposite to Michmash <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-5.htm">1 Samuel 14:5</a>, is almost certainly "Jeba," which stands picturesquely on the top of its steep terraced hill on the very edge of the "Wady Suweinit."

The king of Israel had intended to make a great fortress out of Ramah. Hence there was prepared an immense quantity of stone and wood for his fortifications.

This was the northern limit of the southern kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-8.htm">2 Kings 23:8</a>). It occupied a striking position, standing on a rocky knoll on the south side of the great gorge of Michmash (now known as the <span class="accented">Wady Suweinit</span>), a "great crack or fissure in the country, with vertical precipices some 800 feet high" (Conder, p. 254; cf. Dict. Bib., 1. p. 658 and Porter, 1. p. 214). As Geba would command the pass, it is easy to understand why Asa fortified it, the more so as this defile "appears to have been more than once the meeting place between the Jews and their enemies" (Conder)], <span class="cmt_word">and Mizpah.</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">the</span> <span class="accented">Mizpah</span>, <span class="accented">i.e., watch tower</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-49.htm">Genesis 31:49</a>). The name points to an eminence, but it is remarkable that while so many sites of minor importance have been recovered, this old gathering place of the tribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-1.htm">Judges 21:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-5.htm">1 Samuel 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-17.htm">1 Samuel 10:17-25</a>), and the seat of Gedaliah's government (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-6.htm">Jeremiah 40:6</a>), cannot be identified with certainty.

Bib., 2 p. 389) argue in favour of Seopus, and "the survey has done little to throw light on this question" (see Conder, pp. 257-9). It is to be hoped that the "pit," or well, which Asa made (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-9.htm">Jeremiah 41:9</a>), probably "to provide Mizpah with a plentiful supply of water in ease of a siege" (Ewald), may yet be brought to light. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The state of hostility between Judah and Israel continued during the reign of Asa; and Baasha the king of Israel advanced, etc. These statements are completed and elucidated by the Chronicles. After the great victory obtained by Abijam over Jeroboam, the kingdom of Judah enjoyed rest for ten years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-1.htm">2 Chronicles 14:1</a>). Asa employed this time in exterminating idolatry, fortifying different cities, and equipping his army (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-1.htm">2 Chronicles 14:1-7</a>). Then the Cushite Zerah invaded the land of Judah with an innumerable army (in the eleventh year of Asa), but was totally defeated by the help of the Lord (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-8.htm">2 Chronicles 14:8-14</a>); whereupon Asa, encouraged by the prophet Azariah, the son of Oded, proceeded with fresh zeal to the extermination of such traces of idolatry as still remained in the kingdom, then renewed the altar of burnt-offering in front of the temple-hall, and in the fifteenth year of his reign held, with the whole nation, a great festival of thanksgiving and rejoicing to the Lord at Jerusalem (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-1.htm">2 Chronicles 15:1-15</a>). The next year, the sixteenth of his reign and the thirty-sixth from the division of the kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-1.htm">2 Chronicles 16:1</a>), Baasha commenced hostilities, by advancing against Judah, taking possession of Ramah, the present er Rm (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-25.htm">Joshua 18:25</a>), which was only two hours and a quarter from Jerusalem, and fortifying it. The occupation of Ramah is not expressly mentioned indeed, but it is implied in &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1506;&#1500; &#1497;&#1492;, which affirms the hostile invasion of Judah. For Ramah, from its very situation in the heart of the tribe of Benjamin and the immediate neighbourhood of Jerusalem, can neither have been a border city nor have belonged to the kingdom of Israel. The intention of Baasha, therefore, in fortifying Ramah cannot have been merely to restrain his own subjects from passing over into the kingdom of Judah, but was evidently to cut off from the kingdom of Judah all free communication with the north. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1514;&#1468;&#1514; &#1500;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, "that they might not give one going out or one coming in to Asa;" i.e., to cut off from the others all connection with Asa, and at the same time to cut off from those with Asa all connection with this side. The main road from Jerusalem to the north passed by Ramah, so that by shutting up this road the line of communication of the kingdom of Judah was of necessity greatly disturbed. Moreover, the fortification of Ramah by Baasha presupposes the reconquest of the cities which Abijam had taken from the kingdom of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-19.htm">2 Chronicles 13:19</a>), and which, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-19.htm">2 Chronicles 13:19</a>, were still in the possession of Asa.</body></html>
