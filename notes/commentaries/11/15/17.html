It is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-5.htm" title="And she dwelled under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.">Judges 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-13.htm" title="And he said to his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.">Judges 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-29.htm" title="They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.">Isaiah 10:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-1.htm" title="The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive to Babylon.">Jeremiah 40:1</a>, and is identified with the village known as <span class= "ital">Er-Ram </span>at the present day.<p>This fortification of Ramah close to the hostile capital—like the fortification of Decelea, near Athens, in the Peloponnesian war—was a standing menace to Judah. Baasha, who was a military chief, seems to have been warned by the ill-success of former attempts to invade and subjugate Judah, and to have used this easier means of keeping the enemy in check, and provoking a conflict—if a conflict there was to be—on his own ground. The text, however, implies a further design to blockade the road between the kingdoms, perhaps explained by the statement, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/15-9.htm" title="And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.">2Chronicles 15:9-10</a>, of the falling away of many from Israel to Asa, now in the height of his prosperity.

That is right indeed which is so in God's eyes. Asa's times were times of reformation. He removed that which was evil; there reformation begins, and a great deal he found to do. When Asa found idolatry in the court, he rooted it out thence. Reformation must begin at home. Asa honours and respects his mother; he loves her well, but he loves God better. Those that have power are happy when thus they have hearts to use it well. We must not only cease to do evil, but learn to do well; not only cast away the idols of our iniquity, but dedicate ourselves and our all to God's honour and glory. Asa was cordially devoted to the service of God, his sins not arising from presumption. But his league with Benhadad arose from unbelief. Even true believers find it hard, in times of urgent danger, to trust in the Lord with all their heart. Unbelief makes way for carnal policy, and thus for one sin after another. Unbelief has often led Christians to call in the help of the Lord's enemies in their contests with their brethren; and some who once shone brightly, have thus been covered with a dark cloud towards the end of their days.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ramah (perhaps "Er-Ram;" marginal reference) was situated halfway between Bethel and Jerusalem. Its distance from Jerusalem was no more than five miles so that its occupation was a menace to that capital. Baasha's seizure of Ramah implies a previous recovery of the towns taken by Abijam from Jeroboam, namely, Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephrain <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-19.htm">2 Chronicles 13:19</a>, and was a carrying of the war into the enemy's country. Could his conquest have been maintained, it would have crippled Judah seriously, and have almost compelled a transfer of the capital to Hebron.<p>That he might not suffer any to go out or come in - Baasha, in seizing Ramah, professed to be acting on the defensive. His complaint seems to have been well founded (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-9.htm">2 Chronicles 15:9</a>); but it was more than a defensive measure - it was the first step toward a conquest of the southern kingdom. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16, 17. there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days&#8212;Asa enjoyed a ten years' peace after Jeroboam's defeat by Abijam, and this interval was wisely and energetically spent in making internal reforms, as well as increasing the means of national defense (2Ch 14:1-7). In the fifteenth year of his reign, however, the king of Israel commenced hostilities against him, and, invading his kingdom, erected a strong fortress at Ramah, which was near Gibeah, and only six Roman miles from Jerusalem. Afraid lest his subjects might quit his kingdom and return to the worship of their fathers, he wished to cut off all intercourse between the two nations. Ramah stood on an eminence overhanging a narrow ravine which separated Israel from Judah, and therefore he took up a hostile position in that place.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Baasha went up against Judah; </span> perceiving Asa’s great success, of which see <span class="bld"> 2Ch 14 2Ch 15</span>, and the defection of many of his own subjects to him upon that occasion, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-9.htm" title="And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.">2 Chronicles 15:9</a></span>, he began to bestir himself, and commenceth a war against him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Built, </span> i.e. repaired and fortified, Ramah, a city of Benjamin; which either belonged to the kingdom of Israel, from the division, (as some other places of that tribe are supposed to have done; of which <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-13.htm" title="However, I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe to your son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.">1 Kings 11:13</a>"</span>,) or belonged to Judah, but was now invaded and taken by Baasha, and fortified. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah; </span> therefore he chose this place, because it was in the way from his kingdom to Jerusalem, and, as some add, in or near the straits of the mountains, where they could easily discover and hinder all passengers that way. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah,....

It was the key, consequently, to both kingdoms.

It was not merely to have an advanced post as a menace to Jerusalem (Rawlinson), but primarily, by its command of the high road, to prevent his subjects from falling away to the kingdom of Judah, or even from going up to Jerusalem to worship; in fact, to isolate Judah and to blockade its capital. That there was a great defection to Ass at this time we know from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-9.htm">2 Chronicles 15:9</a>. This was an exodus which Baasha felt must be checked. Blunt ("Coincidences," pp. 176-8) has happily shown from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-6.htm">2 Chronicles 16:6</a>, etc., how the primary object must have been to "stop the alarming drainage of all that was virtuous out of their borders." Rawlinson sees in the fortification of this place "the first step towards a conquest of the southern kingdom." But as to this the text is silent, or rather it assigns an entirely different reason.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As ruler Asa walked in the ways of his pious ancestor David: he banished the male prostitutes out of the land, abolished all the abominations of idolatry, which his fathers (Abijam and Rehoboam) had introduced, deposed his grandmother Maacah from the rank of a queen, because she had made herself an idol for the Ashera, and had the idol hewn in pieces and burned in the valley of the Kidron. &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; is a contemptuous epithet applied to idols (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>); it does not mean stercorei, however, as the Rabbins affirm, but logs, from &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;, to roll, or masses of stone, after the Chaldee &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-8.htm">Ezra 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-4.htm">Ezra 6:4</a>), generally connected with &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;. It is so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-16.htm">Deuteronomy 29:16</a>. &#1502;&#1508;&#1500;&#1510;&#1514;, formido, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1509;, terrere, timere, hence an idol as an object of fear, and not pudendum, a shameful image, as Movers (Phniz. i. p. 571), who follows the Rabbins, explains it, understanding thereby a Phallus as a symbol of the generative and fructifying power of nature. With regard to the character of this idol, nothing further can be determined than that it was of wood, and possibly a wooden column like the &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>). "But the high places departed not," i.e., were not abolished. By the &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; we are not to understand, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-12.htm">1 Kings 15:12</a>, altars of high places dedicated to idols, but unlawful altars to Jehovah. It is so in the other passages in which this formula recurs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-24.htm">1 Kings 22:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-4.htm">2 Kings 12:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-4.htm">2 Kings 14:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-4.htm">2 Kings 15:4</a>; and the parallel passages <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-17.htm">2 Chronicles 15:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-33.htm">2 Chronicles 20:33</a>). The apparent discrepancy between the last-mentioned passages and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-2.htm">2 Chronicles 14:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-4.htm">2 Chronicles 14:4</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-6.htm">2 Chronicles 17:6</a>, may be solved very simply on the supposition that the kings (Asa and Jehoshaphat) did indeed abolish the altars on the high places, but did not carry their reforms in the nation thoroughly out; and not by distinguishing between the bamoth dedicated to Jehovah and those dedicated to idols, as Thenius, Bertheau, and Caspari, with many of the earlier commentators, suppose. For although <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-2.htm">2 Chronicles 14:2</a> is very favourable to this solution, since both &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; and &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512; dna &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493; &#1502;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; are mentioned there, it does not accord with <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-6.htm">2 Chronicles 17:6</a>, where &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; cannot be merely idolatrous altars dedicated to the Canaanitish Baal, but unquestionably refer to the unlawful altars of Jehovah, or at any rate include them. Moreover, the next clause in the passage before us, "nevertheless Asa's heart was wholly given to the Lord," shows that the expression &#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1488; &#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; nois does not mean that the king allowed the unlawful Jehovah-bamoth to remain, but simply that, notwithstanding his fidelity to Jehovah, the bamoth did not depart, so that he was unable to carry the abolition of them thoroughly out.</body></html>
