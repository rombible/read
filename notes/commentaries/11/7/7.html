Mr. Fergusson, comparing it “with the remains of Assyrian and Persian examples,” supposes it to have been square, supported on four pillars in the centre, between which the throne stood, and having openings on the four sides for the public, the king, and his officers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-7.htm" title="Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.">1 Kings 7:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">He made a porch for the throne, even the porch of judgment — </span>So it was called, because here he sat to judge and determine the causes that were brought before him.

He was thirteen years building his house, yet he built the temple in little more than seven years; not that he was more exact, but less eager in building his own house, than in building God's.

Of the House of Lebanon.<p>2. He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon&#8212;It is scarcely possible to determine whether this was a different edifice from the former, or whether his house, the house of the forest of Lebanon, and the one for Pharaoh's daughter, were not parts of one grand palace. As difficult is it to decide what was the origin of the name; some supposing it was so called because built on Lebanon; others, that it was in or near Jerusalem, but contained such a profuse supply of cedar columns as to have occasioned this peculiar designation. We have a similar peculiarity of name in the building called the East India house, though situated in London. The description is conformable to the arrangement of Eastern palaces. The building stood in the middle of a great oblong square, which was surrounded by an enclosing wall, against which the houses and offices of those attached to the court were built. The building itself was oblong, consisting of two square courts, flanking a large oblong hall which formed the center, and was one hundred cubits long, by fifty broad. This was properly the house of the forest of Lebanon, being the part where were the cedar pillars of this hall. In front was the porch of judgment, which was appropriated to the transaction of public business. On the one side of this great hall was the king's house; and on the other the harem or royal apartments for Pharaoh's daughter (Es 2:3, 9). This arrangement of the palace accords with the Oriental style of building, according to which a great mansion always consists of three divisions, or separate houses&#8212;all connected by doors and passages&#8212;the men dwelling at one extremity, the women of the family at the other, while public rooms occupy the central part of the building.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He made a porch; </span> another porch or distinct room without the house. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For the throne, </span> described <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-18.htm" title="Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.">1 Kings 10:18</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Where he might judge</span> the people that brought their causes before him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">From one side of the floor to the other, </span> i.e. the whole floor; or, <span class="ital">from floor to floor</span>, i.e. from the lower floor on the ground, to the upper floor which covered it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then he made a porch for the throne,....

On kings sitting in public to hear causes and give judgment, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-10.htm" title="And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.">1 Kings 22:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/122-5.htm" title="For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.">Psalm 122:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and</span> it was <span class="ital">covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other</span>] Literally ‘from floor to floor.’ What is meant is that this was not an unenclosed porch like ‘the porch of pillars’ mentioned previously, but that it was enclosed with cedar wood walls all round from the floor to the ceiling. If this can be the sense of the word ‘floor’ in the second case, we must suppose the roof of the porch to be regarded as the floor of some upper room above it. But the word ‘floor’ <span class="greekheb">קרקע</span> is not very unlike <span class="greekheb">קורות</span> ‘beams’ and so some have suspected the scribe of having written the former instead of the latter in the second place. This would make all easy, but the other explanation is quite possible, and is accepted by Gesenius, though De Wette translates as in A.V.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then he made a porch</span> [or <span class="accented">the</span> porch] <span class="cmt_word">for the throne where he might Judge</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, it was at once audience chamber (throne room, ch. 10:18) and court of justice], <span class="cmt_word">even the porch of judgment</span> [Stanley remarks that this "porch, or gate of justice, still kept alive the likeness of the old patriarchal custom of sitting in judgment at the gate." He then refers to the "gate of justice" at Granada and the "Sublime <span class="accented">Porte</span> "at Constantinople. It is, perhaps, not quite so certain that "this porch was the gem and centre of the whole empire," or that because it was so much thought of a similar but smaller porch was erected for the queen (ver. 8) ("Jewish Ch.," 2. p. 195)]: <span class="cmt_word">and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.</span> [Heb. from <span class="accented">the floor to the floor</span>, as marg.

Keil thinks the ceiling served as the floor of an upper story, built over the porch of judgment, but, as Bahr observes, no such upper story is even hinted at elsewhere. It seems to me that, on the whole, the A.V. rendering is to be retained, the meaning being that the whole space, both of wall and cieling, from one side of the floor to the opposite side, was covered with cedar.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Erection of the royal palace. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-1.htm">1 Kings 7:1</a> is closely connected in form with <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a>, and contains a summary account of the building, which is more minutely described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2-12</a>. "And Solomon built his house (his palace) in thirteen years, and finished (in that time) all his house." The thirteen years are to be reckoned after the completion of the temple in seven years, so that the two buildings were executed in twenty years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-10.htm">1 Kings 9:10</a>). The expression &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; is used, because the palace consisted of several buildings connected together; namely, (1) the house of the forest of Lebanon (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2-5</a>); (2) the pillar-hall with the porch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-6.htm">1 Kings 7:6</a>); (3) the throne-room and judgment-hall (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-7.htm">1 Kings 7:7</a>); (4) the king's dwelling-house and the house of Pharaoh's daughter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-8.htm">1 Kings 7:8</a>). That all these buildings were only different portions of the one royal palace, and the house of the forest of Lebanon was not a summer residence of Solomon erected on Lebanon itself, as many of the earlier commentators supposed, is indisputably evident, not only from the first verse when correctly interpreted, but also and still more clearly from the fact that when the buildings of Solomon are spoken of afterwards (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-1.htm">1 Kings 9:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-10.htm">1 Kings 9:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-12.htm">1 Kings 10:12</a>), we only read of the house of Jehovah and the house of the king, that is to say, of the temple and one palace. The description of the several portions of this palace is so very brief, that it is impossible to form a distinct idea of its character. The different divisions are given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-1.htm">1 Kings 7:1-8</a> in their natural order, commencing at the back and terminating with the front (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-8.htm">1 Kings 7:8</a>), and there then follows in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-9.htm">1 Kings 7:9-12</a> the description of the stones that were used.</body></html>
