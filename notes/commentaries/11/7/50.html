Outward images cannot represent, words cannot express, the heart cannot conceive, his preciousness or his love. Let us come to him, and wash away our sins in his blood; let us seek for the purifying grace of his Spirit; let us maintain communion with the Father through his intercession, and yield up ourselves and all we have to his service.

As ‘basons’ occurs later on in the verse, the R.V. has changed ‘bowls’ here to <span class="bld">‘cups,’</span> a rendering given for this word sometimes on the margin of A.

Cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-15.htm" title="And the fire pans, and the bowls, and such things as were of gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.">2 Kings 25:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-19.htm" title="And the basins, and the fire pans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the captain of the guard away.">Jeremiah 52:19</a>. In the latter part of this verse the R.V. preserves the order of the Hebrew, and gives a little more explicitness, by removing ‘of gold’ after ‘hinges’ to the end of the verse.
