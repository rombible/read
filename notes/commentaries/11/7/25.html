Jachin, God will fix this roving mind. It is good that the heart be established with grace. Boaz, In him is our strength, who works in us both to will and to do. Spiritual strength and stability are found at the door of God's temple, where we must wait for the gifts of grace, in use of the means of grace. Spiritual priests and spiritual sacrifices must be washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and of regeneration. We must wash often, for we daily contract pollution. There are full means provided for our cleansing; so that if we have our lot for ever among the unclean it will be our own fault.

But in the temple there were separate vessels provided for these offices. (See on [297]2Ch 4:6). The molten sea was an immense semicircular vase, measuring seventeen and a half feet in diameter, and being eight and three-fourths feet in depth. This, at three and a half inches in thickness, could not weigh less than from twenty-five to thirty tons in one solid casting&#8212;and held from sixteen thousand to twenty thousand gallons of water. [See on [298]2Ch 4:3.] The brim was all carved with lily work or flowers; and oxen were carved or cut on the outside all round, to the number of three hundred; and it stood on a pedestal of twelve oxen. These oxen must have been of considerable size, like the Assyrian bulls, so that their corresponding legs would give thickness or strength to support so great a weight for, when the vessel was filled with water, the whole weight would be about one hundred tons [Napier].

It is probably conceived that the water was by cocks drawn out of the mouths of these oxen. Three of these looked each way; partly for the more equal and convenient support of the vessel; and partly that divers persons might draw water out of it at the same time, which was frequently necessary, especially in great solemnities. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>It stood upon twelve oxen,....

See note on ver. 20. Keil says the feet of the oxen no doubt rested on a metal plate, so that they were fixed and immoveable; but this lacks proof. The oxen would be immovable in any case, owing to the weight of the metal and the water. All conjectures as to the height and size of the oxen are necessarily of little value. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-19.htm">1 Kings 7:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-20.htm">1 Kings 7:20</a> a second decoration of the capitals of the pillars is mentioned, from which we may see that the rounding with the chain-like plaited work and the pomegranates enclosing it did not cover the capital to the very top, but only the lower portion of it. The decoration of the upper part is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-19.htm">1 Kings 7:19</a> : "And capitals, which were upon the top of the pillars, were (or, Hiram made) lily-work after the manner of the hall, four cubits." The lily-work occupied, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-20.htm">1 Kings 7:20</a>, the upper portion of the capitals, which is here called &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1514;, as a crown set upon the lower portion. It was lily-work, i.e., sculpture in the form of flowering lilies. The words &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; are obscure. According to Bttcher and Thenius, &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; is intended to indicate the position of the pillars within the hall, so that their capitals sustained the lintel of the doorway. But even if &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; were rendered, within the hall, as it is by Bttcher, it is impossible to see how this meaning could be obtained from the words "capitals upon the head of the pillars lily-work within the hall." In that case we must at least have "the pillars within the hall;" and &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; would be connected with &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, instead of being separated from it by &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503; &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;. Even if we were to introduce a stop after &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503; and take &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; by itself, the expression "in (or at) the hall" would not in itself indicate the position of the pillars in the doorway, to say nothing of the fact that it is only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-21.htm">1 Kings 7:21</a> that anything is said concerning the position of the pillars. Again, the measurement "four cubits" cannot be understood, as it is by Thenius, as denoting the diameter of the capitals of the pillars; it must rather indicate the measure of the lily-work, that is to say, it affirms that there were four cubits of lily-work on the capitals, which were five cubits high, - in other words, the lily-work covered the four upper cubits of the capitals; from which it still further follows, that the plaited work which formed the decoration of the lower portion of the capitals was only one cubit broad or high. Consequently &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; cannot be understood in any other sense than "in the manner of or according to the hall," and can only express the thought, that there was lily-work on the capitals of the pillars as there was on the hall. For the vindication of this use of &#1489;&#1468; see Ges. Lex. by Dietrich, s.v. &#1489;&#1468;.<p>(Note: This is the way in which the earlier translators appear to have understood it: e.g., lxx &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bc; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; ("lily-work according to the hall four cubits"); Vulg. Capitella... quasi opere lilii fabricata erant in porticu quatuor cubitorum; Chald. &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1506; &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; &#1506;&#1493;&#1489;&#1491; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514;&#1488; &#1500;&#1511;&#1497;&#1496; &#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1488; (opus liliaceum collectum in porticu quatuor cubitorum); Syr. opus liliaceum idem fecit (Syr. wa-(ekad ke)set[a4wa4)) in porticu quatuor cubitis. These readings appear to be based upon the view supported by Rashi (&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; for &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;): lily-work as it was in the hall.)<p>There is no valid objection to the inference to which this leads, namely, that on the frontispiece of the temple-hall there was a decoration of lily-work. For since the construction of the hall is not more minutely described, we cannot expect a description of its decorations. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-20.htm">1 Kings 7:20</a> a more precise account is given of the position in which the crowns consisting of lily-work were placed on the capitals of this columns, so that this verse is to be regarded as an explanation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-19.htm">1 Kings 7:19</a> : namely, capitals upon the pillars (did he make) also above near the belly, which was on the other side of the plait-work." &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503;, the belly, i.e., the belly-shaped rounding, can only be the rounding of the lower portion of the capitals, which is called &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-41.htm">1 Kings 7:41</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-42.htm">1 Kings 7:42</a>. Hence &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1489;&#1499;&#1492; &#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512; (Keri), "on the other side of the plaited work," can only mean behind or under the plait, since we cannot suppose that there was a belly-shaped rounding above the caldron-shaped rounding which was covered with plaited work, and between this and the lily-work. The belly-shaped rounding, above or upon which the plaited work lay round about, might, when looked at from without, be described as being on the other side of it, i.e., behind it. In the second half of the verse: "and the pomegranates two hundred in rows round about on the second capital," the number of the pomegranates placed upon the capitals, which was omitted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-18.htm">1 Kings 7:18</a>, is introduced in a supplementary form.<p>(Note: Hermann Weiss (Kostmkunde, i. p. 367) agrees in the main with the idea worked out in the text; but he assumes, on the ground of monumental views, that the decoration was of a much simpler kind, and one by no means out of harmony with the well-known monumental remains of the East. In his opinion, the pillars consisted of "a shaft nineteen cubits in height, surrounded at the top, exactly after the fashion of the ornamentation of the Egyptian pillars, with seven bands decorated like plaited work, which unitedly covered a cubit, in addition to which there was the lily-work of five cubits in height, i.e., a slender capital rising up in the form of the calyx of a lily, ornamented with pomegranates." Our reasons for dissenting from this opinion are given in the exposition of the different verses.)</body></html>
