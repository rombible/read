It seems evidently to have enclosed the whole palace, and may have contained quarters for the guards and the household. There must have been, of course, inner courts, round which both the more public and the more private buildings of the palace were grouped.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_kings/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-12.htm" title="And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.">1 Kings 7:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">And the great court — </span>Namely, of Solomon’s palace, mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-8.htm" title="And his house where he dwelled had another court within the porch, which was of the like work.

Solomon began with the temple; he built for God first, and then his other buildings. The surest foundations of lasting prosperity are laid in early piety. He was thirteen years building his house, yet he built the temple in little more than seven years; not that he was more exact, but less eager in building his own house, than in building God's. We ought to prefer God's honour before our own ease and satisfaction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The palace, like the temple, had two courts <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-36.htm">1 Kings 6:36</a>, not, however, one immediately within the other. The lesser court of the palace seems to have been a private inner court among the buildings <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-8.htm">1 Kings 7:8</a>. The greater court was outside all the buildings, surrounding the palace on every side.

The great court was the hindmost part of all the palace grounds, and was apparently higher than the level of the front part. The way in which it was enclosed was by a low wall (sunk fence) as was done for the inner-court of the Temple.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">both for the inner court of the house of the Lord</span>] The conjunction with which this sentence begins is the usual copulative. But the sense should be ‘like as the inner court, &c.’ (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-34.htm" title="And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.">1 Kings 6:34</a>.)

The R.V. has given the true sense in the text ‘<span class="bld">like as</span> the inner court of the house of the Lord, and the porch of the house,’ and has put the literal translation on the margin. There is no great difficulty in gathering the former sense from the latter. We have only to take the construction to be ‘and <span class="ital">thus was it done</span> for the inner court &c.… and for.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the porch of the house</span>] Probably the porch intended is that spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-3.htm" title="And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.">1 Kings 6:3</a>. ‘The house’ without any defining words can only be taken of the Temple; so that we cannot understand any porch in Solomon’s own house.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the great court round about</span> [The palace, again like the temple, had two courts.

In all these coincidences we have tokens of the same designing hand], <span class="cmt_word">both for the inner court of the house of the Lord.</span> [This sudden digression from the court of the palace to the temple is suspicious, and suggests either a mistranslation or corruption of the text. The historian evidently meant to say that the wall of the court, in its three rows of stones and its cedar coping, resembled the inner court of the temple; and, according to some grammarians (Gesen., Ewald), this meaning may well be conveyed by the text as it stands, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> in Hebrew serving sometimes to institute a comparison (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-3.htm">Proverbs 25:3, 12, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-14.htm">Proverbs 26:14</a>, etc.) "As in the court," etc. But the instances just cited, being proverbs or apophthegms, are not strictly parallel with our text. It seems better, on the whole, however, to retain the text in this sense than to replace. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> by <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;</span>, reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5e6;&#x5e8;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d7;&#x5e6;&#x5e8;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5e6;&#x5e8;</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d4;&#x5d7;&#x5e6;&#x5e8;</span> (Horsley) is quite inadmissible, as the constr, case never has the art.], <span class="cmt_word">and for the porch of the house.</span> [It is almost impossible to decide whether the porch of judgment (ver. 7) or the porch of the temple is here meant. The immediate context favours the latter. But this does not seem to have had any court or enclosing wall other than the inner court. Rawlinson decides for the porch of judgment, "which," he says, "had a planking of cedar over the stone pavement" (ver. 7). But ver. 7 (where see note) rather excludes than in-eludes the pavement. The reference is probably to the "court within the porch," mentioned in ver. 8.] After this brief account of the royal palaces, the author proceeds to mention the vessels, etc., used in the temple service, prefacing his description by a few words respecting the great Tyrian artist, by whom they were for the most part cast, and possibly designed also. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The other buildings. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-6.htm">1 Kings 7:6</a>. "And he made the pillar-hall, fifty cubits its length, and thirty cubits its breadth, and a hall in front of them, and pillars and a threshold in front of them." With regard to the situation of this hall in relation to the other parts of the building, which is not precisely defined, we may infer, from the fact that it is mentioned between the house of the forest of Lebanon and the throne and judgment halls, that it stood between these two. The length of this building (fifty cubits) corresponds to the breadth of the house of the forest of Lebanon; so that, according to the analogy of the temple-hall (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>), we might picture to ourselves the length given here as running parallel to the breadth of the house of the forest of Lebanon, and might therefore assume that the pillar-hall was fifty cubits broad and thirty cubits deep. But the statement that there was a hall in front of the pillar-hall is irreconcilable with this assumption. We must therefore understand the length in the natural way, as signifying the measurement from back to front, and regard the pillar-hall as a portico fifty cubits long and thirty cubits broad, in front of which there was also a porch as an entrance. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, in front of them, i.e., in front of the pillars which formed this portico. The last words, "and pillars and threshold in front of them," refer to the porch. This had also pillars, probably on both sides of the doorway, which carried the roof; and in front of them was &#1506;&#1489;, i.e., according to the Chaldee &#1505;&#1511;&#1508;&#1514;&#1488;, the moulding or framework of the threshold, a threshold-like entrance, with steps.</body></html>
