Jachin, God will fix this roving mind. It is good that the heart be established with grace. Boaz, In him is our strength, who works in us both to will and to do. Spiritual strength and stability are found at the door of God's temple, where we must wait for the gifts of grace, in use of the means of grace. Spiritual priests and spiritual sacrifices must be washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and of regeneration. We must wash often, for we daily contract pollution. There are full means provided for our cleansing; so that if we have our lot for ever among the unclean it will be our own fault. Let us bless God for the fountain opened by the sacrifice of Christ for sin and for uncleanness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lavers - Rather, according to the true reading, "pots."

In a round vessel this can only be understood of the diameter, not of the height or depth, as the basins were set upon (&#1506;&#1500;) the stands. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; is dependent upon &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;: he made ten basins, ... one basin upon a stand for the ten stands, i.e., one basin for each stand. If then the basins were a cubit in diameter at the top, and therefore their size corresponded almost exactly to the length and breadth of the stand, whilst the crown-like neck, into which they were inserted, was only a cubit and a half in diameter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-31.htm">1 Kings 7:31</a>), their shape must have resembled that of widespreading shells. And the form thus given to them required the shoulder-pieces described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-30.htm">1 Kings 7:30</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-34.htm">1 Kings 7:34</a> as supports beneath the outer rim of the basins, to prevent their upsetting when the carriage was wheeled about.<p>(Note: The description which Ewald has given of these stands in his Geschichte, iii. pp. 311,312, and still more elaborately in an article in the Gttingen Gelehrten Nachr. 1859, pp. 131-146, is not only obscure, but almost entirely erroneous, since he proposes in the most arbitrary way to make several alterations in the biblical text, on the assumption that the Solomonian stands were constructed just like the small bronze four-wheeled kettle-carriages (hardly a foot in size) which have been discovered in Mecklenburg, Steyermark, and other places of Europe. See on this subject G. C. F. Lisch, "ber die ehernen Wagenbecken der Bronzezeit," in the Jahrbb. des Vereinsf. Mecklenb. Geschichte, ix. pp. 373,374, where a sketch of a small carriage of this kind is given.)</body></html>
