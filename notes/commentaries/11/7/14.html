Jachin, God will fix this roving mind. It is good that the heart be established with grace. Boaz, In him is our strength, who works in us both to will and to do. Spiritual strength and stability are found at the door of God's temple, where we must wait for the gifts of grace, in use of the means of grace. Spiritual priests and spiritual sacrifices must be washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and of regeneration. We must wash often, for we daily contract pollution. There are full means provided for our cleansing; so that if we have our lot for ever among the unclean it will be our own fault. Let us bless God for the fountain opened by the sacrifice of Christ for sin and for uncleanness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hiram's mother, while by birth of the tribe of Dan, had had for her first husband a man of the tribe of Naphtali.

He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali&#8212;In 2Ch 2:14 his mother is said to have been of the daughters of Dan. The apparent discrepancy may be reconciled thus: Hiram's mother, though belonging to the tribe of Dan, had been married to a Naphtalite, so that when married afterwards to a Tyrian, she might be described as a widow of the tribe of Naphtali. Or, if she was a native of the city Dan (Laish), she might be said to be of the daughters of Dan, as born in that place; and of the tribe of Naphtali, as really belonging to it.<p>a worker in brass&#8212;This refers particularly to the works described in this chapter. But in 2Ch 2:13 his artistic skill is represented as extending to a great variety of departments.

For in the first place it is not absolutely necessary to understand by Dan the tribe of that name. It may well refer to the town, formerly Leshem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>), or Laish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-7.htm">Judges 18:7, 27</a>), colonised by the Danites, and thenceforward bearing their name (ver. 29), which was situated within the borders of Naphtali. If, however, it is preferred to see in the "daughters of Dan" a tribal reference, we may suppose (with Keil, <span class="accented">al.</span>) that the woman was originally a Danite, but became, through her first husband, "of the tribe of Naphtali." But the first explanation is the more simple and obvious], <span class="cmt_word">and his father was a man of Tyre</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, Hiram was the son (not stepson, or adopted son, as the Rabbins) of a mixed marriage. In earlier times Laish had but little intercourse with the Zidonians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-28.htm">Judges 18:28</a>). It is nowhere stated that the inhabitants were of Phoenician extraction; nor can it be justly inferred from this passage], <span class="cmt_word">a worker in brass</span> [or <span class="accented">copper.</span> Brass is a compound of copper and zinc; but <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> originally and strictly signifies a pure metal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-9.htm">Deuteronomy 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-25.htm">Deuteronomy 33:25</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-2.htm">Job 28:2</a>). There were copper mines in Palestine, and the art of working this metal was known at a very remote period (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-22.htm">Genesis 4:22</a>, Hebrews, and see Wilkinson's "Ancient Egypt," vol. 3. p. 243; and De Rougemont, "Age du Bronze," p. 180). In later times the word sometimes denoted brass (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), or copper-bronze Ca mixture of copper and tin). Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-28.htm">Jeremiah 6:28</a>. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-14.htm">2 Chronicles 2:14</a> we learn that Hiram was "skilful to work in gold and in silver in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber," etc. From the mention of brass only in this passage, and in ver. 45, it has been somewhat hastily concluded that "the work that he personally did for Solomon" was "limited to works in brass" (Rawlinson). It is, perhaps, safer to say that brass only is mentioned here, because the following section treats exclusively of the brazen ornaments, etc., of the sanctuary (Keil). It would almost seem, however (see note on ver. 48), as if he was not employed to make the vessels of gold. Nor does this supposition really contradict the statement made below, viz., that he wrought all Solomon's work]: <span class="cmt_word">and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning</span> [or <span class="accented">knowledge</span>, as the same word is rendered <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-3.htm">Exodus 31:3</a>, where similar language is used of Bezaleel. It is noticeable, however, that the words "filled with the spirit of God," used of the Hebrew, are not applied to the Tyrian workman] <span class="cmt_word">to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon</span> [probably with a considerable number of assistants], <span class="cmt_word">and wrought all his work.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After (behind) the throne and judgment hall then followed the king's own palace, the principal entrance to which was probably through the throne-hall, so that the king really delivered judgment and granted audiences in the gate of his palace. "His house, where he dwelt, in the other court inwards from the (throne) hall was like this work," i.e., was built like the throne-hall; "and a (dwelling) house he made for the daughter of Pharaoh, whom Solomon had taken, like this hall." The construction of the dwelling-places of the king and queen cannot be ascertained from these words, because the hall with which its style is compared is not more minutely described. All that can be clearly inferred from the words, "in the other court inside the hall," is, that the abode of the king and his Egyptian wife had a court of its own, and when looked at from the entrance, formed the hinder court of the whole palace. The house of Pharaoh's daughter was probably distinct from the dwelling-place of the king, so that the palace of the women formed a building by itself, most likely behind the dwelling-house of the king, since the women in the East generally occupy the inner portion of the house. The statement that the dwelling-place of the king and queen formed a court by itself within the complex of the palace, warrants the further inference, that the rest of the buildings (the house of the forest of Lebanon, the pillar-hall, and the throne-hall) were united together in one first or front court.</body></html>
