Jachin, God will fix this roving mind. It is good that the heart be established with grace. Boaz, In him is our strength, who works in us both to will and to do. Spiritual strength and stability are found at the door of God's temple, where we must wait for the gifts of grace, in use of the means of grace. Spiritual priests and spiritual sacrifices must be washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and of regeneration. We must wash often, for we daily contract pollution. There are full means provided for our cleansing; so that if we have our lot for ever among the unclean it will be our own fault. Let us bless God for the fountain opened by the sacrifice of Christ for sin and for uncleanness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>According to the proportion of every one - i. e.

The description of their structure shows that they were elegantly fitted up and skilfully adapted to their purpose. They stood, not on the axles, but on four rests attached to the axles, so that the figured sides were considerably raised above the wheels. They were all exactly alike in form and size. The lavers which were borne upon them were vessels capable each of holding three hundred gallons of water, upwards of a ton weight. The whole, when full of water, would be no less than two tons [Napier].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>After this manner he made the ten bases,....

"And the mouth of it (the basin) was within the crown and upwards with a cubit, and the mouth of it (the crown) was rounded, stand-work, a cubit and a half (wide), and on its mouth also there was engraved work, and its panels were square, not round." To understand this verse, we must observe that, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-35.htm">1 Kings 7:35</a>, the mechonah chest was provided at the top with a dome-shaped covering, in the centre of which there was an elevation resembling the capital of a pillar (&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1514;, the crown), supporting the basin, which was inserted into it by its lower rim. The suffix in &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; (its mouth) is supposed by Thenius to refer to the mechonah chest, and he questions the allusion to the basin, on the ground that this was so flat that a mouth-like opening could not possibly be spoken of, and the basins were never within the mechonah. But however correct these two remarks may be in themselves, they by no means demonstrate the necessity of taking &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; as referring to the mechonah chest. For &#1508;&#1468;&#1492; (the mouth) is not necessarily to be understood as denoting a mouth-like opening to the basin; but just as &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1508;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-32.htm">Exodus 28:32</a> signifies the opening of the clothes for the head, i.e., for putting the head through when putting on the clothes, so may &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; (its mouth) be the opening or mouth for the basin, i.e., the opening into which the basin fitted and was emptied, the water in the basin being let off into the mechonah chest through the head-shaped neck by means of a tap or plug. The mouth was really the lower or contracted portion of the shell-shaped basin, which was about a cubit in height within the neck and upwards, that is to say, in all, inasmuch as it went partly into the neck and rose in part above it. The &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492; (the mouth thereof) which follows is the (upper) opening of the crown-like neck of the lid of the mechonah. This was rounded, &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503;, stand-work, i.e., according to De Wette's correct paraphrase, formed after the style of the foot of a pillar, a cubit and a half in diameter. "And also upon the mouth of it (the mechonah) was carved work." The &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; (also) refers to the fact that the sides of the mechonah were already ornamented with carving. &#1502;&#1505;&#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, the panels of the crown-like neck (&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1514;) and its mouth (&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;) were square, like the panels of the sides of the mechonah chest. The fact that panels are spoken of in connection with this neck, may be explained on the assumption that with its height of one cubit and its circumference of almost five cubits (which follows from its having a diameter of a cubit and a half) it had stronger borders of brass to strengthen its bearing power, while between them it consisted of thinner plates, which are called fillings or panels. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-32.htm">1 Kings 7:32</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-33.htm">1 Kings 7:33</a>, the wheels are more minutely described. Every stool had four wheels under the panels, i.e., not against the sides of the chest, but under them, and &#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, hands or holders of the wheels, i.e., special contrivances for fastening the wheels to the axles, probably larger and more artistically worked than the linch-pins of ordinary carriages. These &#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; were only required when the wheels turned upon the axles, and not when they were fastened to them. The height of the wheel was a cubit and a half, i.e., not half the height, but the whole. For with a half height of a cubit and a half the wheels would have been three cubits in diameter; and as the chest was only four cubits long, the hinder wheels and front wheels would almost have touched one another. The work (construction) of the wheels resembled that of (ordinary) carriage wheels; but everything about them (holders, felloes, spokes, and naves) was cast in brass. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-34.htm">1 Kings 7:34</a> the description passes to the upper portion of the mechonah. "And he made four shoulder-pieces at the four corners of one (i.e., of every) stand; out of the stand were its shoulder-pieces." &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514; are the shoulder-pieces already mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-30.htm">1 Kings 7:30</a>, which were attached to the feet below, or which terminated in feet. They were fastened to the corners in such a way that they seemed to come out of them; and they rose above the corners with a slight inclination (curve) towards the middle of the neck or capital, till they came under the outer rim of the basin which rested upon the capital of the lid of the chest, so as to support the basin, which turned considerably outwards at the top.</body></html>
