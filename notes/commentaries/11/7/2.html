Solomon began with the temple; he built for God first, and then his other buildings. The surest foundations of lasting prosperity are laid in early piety. He was thirteen years building his house, yet he built the temple in little more than seven years; not that he was more exact, but less eager in building his own house, than in building God's.

But it is perhaps best to consider the "house" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-1.htm">1 Kings 7:1</a> as the palace proper - Solomon's own dwelling-house (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-8.htm">1 Kings 7:8</a>); the house of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2</a>, as the state apartments; and the house for Pharaoh's daughter as the hareem or zenana; and to regard these three groups of buildings as distinct, though interconnected, and as together constituting what is else-where termed "the king's house" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-10.htm">1 Kings 9:10</a>.<p>The house of the forest of Lebanon - This name was probably given from the supposed resemblance of the mass of cedar pillars, which was its main feature, to the Lebanon cedar forest. Its length of "a hundred cubits," or 150 feet, was nearly twice as long as the entire temple without the porch. Some of the great halls in Assyrian palaces were occasionally as much as 180 feet.<p>The breadth "of fifty cubits," or 75 feet, is a breadth very much greater than is ever found in Assyria, and one indicative of the employment in the two countries of quite different methods of roofing. By their use of pillars the Jews, like the Persians, were able to cover in a very wide space.<p>Four rows - The Septuagint gives "three rows." If the pillars were forty-five <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-3.htm">1 Kings 7:3</a>, fifteen in a row, there should have been but three rows, as seems to have been the case in the old palace of Cyrus at Pasargadae.

Of the House of Lebanon.<p>2. He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon&#8212;It is scarcely possible to determine whether this was a different edifice from the former, or whether his house, the house of the forest of Lebanon, and the one for Pharaoh's daughter, were not parts of one grand palace. As difficult is it to decide what was the origin of the name; some supposing it was so called because built on Lebanon; others, that it was in or near Jerusalem, but contained such a profuse supply of cedar columns as to have occasioned this peculiar designation. We have a similar peculiarity of name in the building called the East India house, though situated in London. The description is conformable to the arrangement of Eastern palaces. The building stood in the middle of a great oblong square, which was surrounded by an enclosing wall, against which the houses and offices of those attached to the court were built. The building itself was oblong, consisting of two square courts, flanking a large oblong hall which formed the center, and was one hundred cubits long, by fifty broad. This was properly the house of the forest of Lebanon, being the part where were the cedar pillars of this hall. In front was the porch of judgment, which was appropriated to the transaction of public business. On the one side of this great hall was the king's house; and on the other the harem or royal apartments for Pharaoh's daughter (Es 2:3, 9). This arrangement of the palace accords with the Oriental style of building, according to which a great mansion always consists of three divisions, or separate houses&#8212;all connected by doors and passages&#8212;the men dwelling at one extremity, the women of the family at the other, while public rooms occupy the central part of the building.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The house of the forest of Lebanon; </span> a house so called, either, first, Because it was built in the mountain and forest of Lebanon, for his recreation there in summer time.

The multitude of pillars, which was the marked feature of the lower floor, made it admirably suited for the hanging of shields and targets. Its name was probably given because the wood of its pillars came from Lebanon, and when these were in position they looked like the trunks of forest trees.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">upon four rows of cedar pillars</span>] The number of the pillars is not given, but they must have been both very numerous and very substantial to support the three tiers of building which stood above them. It appears that the house had an external wall, and then rows of cedar pillars, four deep, stood round about, within the enclosure, to support the cedar beams which made the first floor of the chambers that ran along the sides. The cedar beams were no doubt let into the external wall as well as supported on the pillars.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He built also</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and he built.</span> The A.V. rendering almost contradicts the view just advanced, viz., that the house of the forest of Lebanon was part of "all the house" (ver. 1)] <span class="cmt_word">the house of the forest of Lebanon</span> [so called, not because it was a summer residence in Lebanon, as some have supposed, nor yet merely because it was built of Lebanon cedar, but because it displayed, a perfect <span class="accented">thicket</span> or <span class="accented">forest</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>) of cedar pillars]; <span class="cmt_word">the length thereof was one hundred cubits</span> [the temple proper was 60], <span class="cmt_word">and the breadth thereof fifty cubits</span> [The temple was but 20. It does not follow that this space of 100 x 50 cubits was all roofed in, for it would seem as if the house was built round a courtyard. Rawlinson remarks that a roof of 75 feet is "much greater than is ever found in Assyria."

Thenius says they were 400, but this is pure conjecture. The description is so meagre and partial that it is impossible to form a correct idea of the building. The remark made above (ch. 6. Introd. Note) as to the temple applies with still greater force to the palaces. "There are few tasks more difficult or puzzling than the attempt to restore an ancient building of which we possess nothing but two verbal descriptions; and these difficulties are very much enhanced when one account is written in a language like Hebrew, the scientific terms in which are, from our ignorance, capable of the widest latitude of interpretation, and the other, though written in a language of which we have a more definite knowledge, was composed by a person who could never have seen the building he was describing" (Fergusson, Dict. Bib. 2. p. 658)], <span class="cmt_word">with cedar beams</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5bb;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> <span class="accented">cut</span> or hewn beams] upon the pillars. [This palace, according to Fergusson, was "the great hall of state and audience" and the principal building of the range. But if it was this, which is very doubtful, for the throne was in the hall of judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-7.htm">1 Kings 5:7</a>), it would seem to have served other purposes besides that of an audience-chamber. Among other things, it was certainly an armoury (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a>. cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-8.htm">Isaiah 22:8</a>). The Arab. Vers. calls it "the house of his arms." Possibly it was also the residence of the  bodyguard (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-28.htm">1 Kings 14:28</a> with 1 Kings 10:17). Bahr observes that the arrangement of the palaces accords with the Jewish conceptions of the kingly office. The first, the armoury, represents him in his militant character (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-20.htm">1 Samuel 8:20</a>), the second in his judicial function (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-4.htm">2 Samuel 15:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9</a>), while the third shows him in his private capacity.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And thus he made upon the door of the Holy Place posts of olive wood from a fourth (of the wall)," i.e., a framework which occupied a fourth of the breadth of the wall, or was five cubits broad (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-31.htm">1 Kings 6:31</a>), "and two doors of cypress wood, two leaves each door turning," i.e., each of the folding doors consisting of two leaves, each of which was made to turn by itself, so that it could be opened and shut alone (without the other; &#1511;&#1500;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; is probably only a copyist's error for &#1510;&#1500;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;). Cypress wood was chosen for the folding doors of the Holy Place, and not olive wood, as in the case of the Most Holy Place, probably because it is lighter in weight, and therefore less likely to sink. It is questionable here what idea we are to form of the division of each folding door into two leaves, each of which turned by itself: whether we are to think of each wing as divided lengthwise into two narrow leaves, or as divided half way up, so that the lower half could be opened without the upper. I agree with Merz in thinking the latter the more probable assumption; for the objection made by Thenius, on the ground that doors of this kind are only seen in the houses of the peasantry, is an idle assertion which cannot be proved. In a doorway of five cubits in breadth, after reckoning the doorposts the width of the two wings could not be more than two cubits each. And if such a door had been divided into two halves, each half would have been only one cubit wide, so that when open it would not have furnished the requisite room for one man conveniently to pass through. On the other hand, we may assume that a folding door of four cubits in breadth, if made in just proportions, would be eight cubits high. And a door of such a height might easily be divided into two halves, so that only the lower half (of two cubits in breadth and about four in height) was opened for the daily entrance of the priests into the Holy Place. These doors probably opened outwards, like those in front of the Most Holy Place.</body></html>
