Jachin, God will fix this roving mind. It is good that the heart be established with grace. Boaz, In him is our strength, who works in us both to will and to do. Spiritual strength and stability are found at the door of God's temple, where we must wait for the gifts of grace, in use of the means of grace. Spiritual priests and spiritual sacrifices must be washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and of regeneration. We must wash often, for we daily contract pollution. There are full means provided for our cleansing; so that if we have our lot for ever among the unclean it will be our own fault. Let us bless God for the fountain opened by the sacrifice of Christ for sin and for uncleanness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The undersetters were cast with the base, not afterward attached to it, and were therefore stronger and better able to support the laver. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27-39. he made ten bases of brass&#8212;These were trucks or four-wheeled carriages, for the support and conveyance of the lavers. The description of their structure shows that they were elegantly fitted up and skilfully adapted to their purpose. They stood, not on the axles, but on four rests attached to the axles, so that the figured sides were considerably raised above the wheels. They were all exactly alike in form and size. The lavers which were borne upon them were vessels capable each of holding three hundred gallons of water, upwards of a ton weight. The whole, when full of water, would be no less than two tons [Napier].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_kings/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Not only of the same matter, but of the same piece, being cast with it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_kings/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base,....

The statement in Josephus, that each centre was divided into three compartments, has nothing to support it in the biblical text, nor is it at all probable in itself, inasmuch as a division of this kind would have rendered the figures placed upon them insignificantly small. "And upon the borders was a base above." &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; is a noun, and has been rendered correctly by the Chaldee &#1499;&#1504;&#1514;&#1488;, basis. The meaning is, above, over the borders, there was a pedestal for the basin upon the chest, which is more fully described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-31.htm">1 Kings 7:31</a>. To take &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; as an adverb does not give a suitable sense. For if we adopt the rendering, and upon the corner borders (or ledges) likewise above (De Wette and Ewald), - i.e., there were also figures of lions, oxen, and cherubim upon the corner borders, - it is impossible to tell what the meaning of &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; can be, to say nothing of the fact that on the corner borders there could hardly be room for such figures as these. This last argument also tells against the rendering adopted by Thenius: "and upon the corner borders, above as well as below the lions and oxen, (there were) wreaths;" in which, moreover, it is impossible to attach any supportable meaning to the &#1499;&#1468;&#1503;. When, on the other hand, Thenius objects to our view that the pedestal in question is spoken of for the first time in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-31.htm">1 Kings 7:31</a>, and that the expression "above the corner borders (ledges)" would be extremely unsuitable, since the pedestal in question was above the whole stand; the former remark is not quite correct, for <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-31.htm">1 Kings 7:31</a> merely contains a more minute description of the character of the pedestal, and the latter is answered by the fact that the pedestal derived its strength from the corner borders or ledges. "And below the lions and oxen were wreaths, pendant work." &#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, here and at <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-36.htm">1 Kings 7:36</a>, is to be explained from &#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-9.htm">Proverbs 4:9</a>, and signifies twists or wreaths. &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491; &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is not "work of sinking," i.e., sunken work (Thenius), which never can be the meaning of &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;, but pendant work, festoons, by which, however, we cannot understand festoons hanging freely, or floating in the air.</body></html>
