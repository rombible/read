The church is all glorious when full of the knowledge of God; for none teaches like him. It is a promise of the teaching and gifts of the Holy Spirit. All that are taught of God are taught to love one another. This seems to relate especially to the glorious times to succeed the tribulations of the church. Holiness, more than any thing, is the beauty of the church. God promises protection. There shall be no fears within; there shall be no fightings without. Military men value themselves on their splendid titles, but God calls them, Wasters made to destroy, for they make wasting and destruction their business. He created them, therefore he will serve his own designs by them. The day is coming when God will reckon with wicked men for their hard speeches, Jude 1:15. Security and final victory are the heritage of each faithful servant of the Lord. The righteousness by which they are justified, and the grace by which they are sanctified, are the gift of God, and the effect of his special love. Let us beseech him to sanctify our souls, and to employ us in his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/54.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And all thy children - All that dwell in this splendid city; all that are the true friends of the Redeemer.

The children of the church, who are born in her, and nursed up at her side, and who are the children of God by adoption, which is made manifest by regeneration; these the Lord will take care of that they be "taught", even "all" of them, from the least to the greatest, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>, they shall be taught of the Lord himself, by his ministers, word, and ordinances, as means, and by his Spirit, as the efficient; by whom they are taught to know themselves, their vileness and sinfulness, their folly and weakness, their want of right counsels, and the insufficiency of their own to know Christ, and the way of salvation by him; him as the only Saviour, able and willing so to know him as to believe in him, receive him, and walk on in him; this had an accomplishment in the first times of the Gospel; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-45.htm">John 6:45</a> and will have a further one in the latter day, when there will be a greater effusion of the Spirit, when the doctrines of the Gospel will be taught and understood more clearly, fully, and largely: <p>and great shall be the peace of thy children; the inward peace of their minds in and from Christ, arising from a view of their justification by his righteousness, from the sprinklings of his blood upon their consciences, and from the discoveries of his love to their souls, enjoyed in a way of believing, and by means of the word and ordinances; also peace among themselves, harmony and concord, and no more strifes, contentions, and animosities; likewise outward peace from enemies, no more persecution or war. This word includes all kind of prosperity, external and internal, temporal and spiritual. This, with the following verses, explain the figurative phrases used in the foregoing. These words are applied by the Jews (a) to the times of the Messiah, when all Israel shall learn the law from the Lord; so the Targum, <p>"all thy children shall know the law of the Lord;'' <p>but it is much better understood of all the children of the church, the true Israel of God, whether Jews or Gentiles, learning the Gospel of Christ. <p>(a) Midrash Tillim, apud Yalkut in Psal. xxi. 1.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/54.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And all thy children <i>shall be</i> <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> taught from the LORD; and great <i>shall be</i> the peace of thy children.</span><p>(l) By the hearing of his word and inward moving of his spirit.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/54.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13, 14</span>.

Christians are all of them "taught of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-45.htm">John 6:45</a> 1 Thessalonians 4:9). The "anointing," which they have from the Holy Ghost, "teaches them, and is truth, and is no lie" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-27.htm">1 John 2:27</a>), and causes them to "know all things" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And great shall be the peace of thy children</span>. Messiah was to be "the Prince of Peace" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>). His birth heralded the coming of "peace on earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-14.htm">Luke 2:14</a>). So far forth as men are true Christians, does peace   reign in the conscience and show itself in the life. Externally there may be persecution, tumult, wars, fightings; but internally, in each heart, there will be a "peace that passes all understanding" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>). God "keeps in perfect peace" those" whose minds are stayed on him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/54.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Thus does Jehovah's displeasure towards Jerusalem pass quickly away; and all the more intense is the manifestation of love which follows His merely momentary anger. "For a small moment have I forsaken thee, and with great mercy will I gather thee. In an effusion of anger I hid my face from thee for a moment, and with everlasting grace I have compassion upon thee, saith Jehovah thy Redeemer." "For a small moment" carries us to the time of the captivity, which was a small moment in comparison with the duration of the tender and merciful love, with which Jehovah once more received the church into His fellowship in the person of its members. &#1512;&#1490;&#1506; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-8.htm">Isaiah 54:8</a> is not an adverb, meaning momentarily, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-9.htm">Isaiah 47:9</a>, but an accusative of duration, signifying a single moment long. Ketseph signifies wrath regarded as an outburst (fragor), like the violence of a storm or a clap of thunder; shetseph, which rhymes with it, is explained by A. Schultens, after the Arabic, as signifying durum et asperum esse: and hence the rendering adopted by Hitzig, "in hard harshness." But this yields no antithesis to "everlasting kindness," which requires that shetseph should be rendered in some way that expresses the idea of something transitory or of short duration. The earlier translators felt this, when like the lxx for example, they adopted the rendering &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834;, and others of a similar kind; and Ibn Labrt, in his writing against Menahem b. Zerk, who gives cho&#774;r&#305;&#772;, burning heat, as a gloss to shetseph, explains it by &#1502;&#1506;&#1496; (as Kimchi and others did afterwards). But, as Jakob Tam correctly observes, "this makes the sense purely tautological." In all probability, sha&#770;tsaph is a form allied to sha&#770;taph, as na&#770;shabh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-7.htm">Isaiah 40:7</a>) is to na&#770;shaph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-24.htm">Isaiah 40:24</a>), and qa&#770;mat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-8.htm">Job 16:8</a>) to qa&#770;mats, which stand in the same relation to one another, so far as the sense is concerned, as bubbling over to flowing over: so that the proper rendering would not be "in the overflowing of glowing heat," as Umbreit thinks, which would require &#1511;&#1510;&#1507; &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1496;&#1507; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-4.htm">Proverbs 27:4</a>), but in the gushing up of displeasure, the overflowing of indignation (Meier). The ketseph is only a shetseph, a vanishing moment (Jer. in momento indignationis), when compared with the true feeling of Jehovah towards Jerusalem, which is chesed &#8219;o&#772;la&#770;m, everlasting kindness. </body></html>
