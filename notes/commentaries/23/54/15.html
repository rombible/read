The church is all glorious when full of the knowledge of God; for none teaches like him. It is a promise of the teaching and gifts of the Holy Spirit. All that are taught of God are taught to love one another. This seems to relate especially to the glorious times to succeed the tribulations of the church. Holiness, more than any thing, is the beauty of the church. God promises protection. There shall be no fears within; there shall be no fightings without. Military men value themselves on their splendid titles, but God calls them, Wasters made to destroy, for they make wasting and destruction their business. He created them, therefore he will serve his own designs by them. The day is coming when God will reckon with wicked men for their hard speeches, Jude 1:15. Security and final victory are the heritage of each faithful servant of the Lord. The righteousness by which they are justified, and the grace by which they are sanctified, are the gift of God, and the effect of his special love. Let us beseech him to sanctify our souls, and to employ us in his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/54.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, they shall surely gather together - The idea in this verse is, that the enemies of the people of God would indeed form alliances and compacts against them, but it would not be under the divine direction, and they would not be able to prevail against the church. The word rendered here 'gather together' (&#1490;&#1493;&#1512;  gu&#770;r) means properly 'to turn aside from the way'; then to sojourn for a time; then to assemble against anyone. It seems here to refer to the gathering together of hostile forces to form an alliance, or to wage war. Great variety, however, has prevailed in the interpretation of the passage, but this seems to be the sense of it. Jerome renders it, 'Lo, a foreigner shall come who was not with me, the stranger shall hereafter be joined to thee,' and seems to understand it of the proselytes that should be made. This sense is found expressly in the Septuagint, 'Lo, proselytes shall come to thee through me, and they shall sojourn with thee, and fly to thee' The Chaldee renders it, 'Lo, the captivity of thy people shall be surely gathered unto thee, and in the end the kings of the people which were assembled to afflict thee, O Jerusalem, shall fall in the midst of thee.' But the above seems to be the correct sense. Alliances would be formed; compacts would be entered into; leagues would be made by the enemies of the people of God, and they would be assembled to destroy the church. This has often been done. Formidable confederations have been entered into for the purpose, and deep-laid plans have been devised to destroy the friends of the Most High. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a> : 'The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord, and against his Anointed.' No small part of history is a record of the combinations and alliances which have been entered into for the purpose of driving the true religion from the world.<p>But not by me - Not under my direction, or by my command.<p>Shall fall for thy sake - Hebrew, &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; &#8219;a&#770;la&#305;&#770;yk - 'Shall fall unto thee.' Lowth, 'Shall come over to thy side.' The phrase seems to mean that they should 'fall to them,' that is, that they should lay aside their opposition, break up their alliances against the church, and come over to it. In proof of this interpretation, Rosenmuller appeals to the following places: <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-19.htm">1 Chronicles 12:19-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-9.htm">2 Chronicles 15:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-9.htm">Jeremiah 21:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-9.htm">Jeremiah 39:9</a>. The passage, therefore, looks to the future conversion of the enemies of the church to the true faith. It has, doubtless, been partially fulfilled in the conversion of nations that have been leagued against the gospel of the Redeemer. There was a striking fulfillment in the times that succeeded the persecutions of Christians in the Roman empire. After all the power of the empire had been enlisted in ten successive persecutions to destroy the church, the very empire that had thus opposed the church was converted to the Christian faith. In a still more signal manner will this be fulfilled when all the powers of the earth now leagued against the gospel shall be brought under the influences of the true religion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/54.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. gather together, &c.&#8212;that is, If it should happen that enemies "gather together" against thee (Ps 2:2), they will not have been sent by Me (compare Ho 8:4) as instruments of My wrath (nay, it will be with My disapproval); for "whosoever shall gather together," &c.

The verse is somewhat difficult. The rendering “gather together” can hardly be defended, and moreover it does not suit the construction (“against,” in the second line, is really “with”). The verb is perhaps best explained as a by-form of a root meaning to “stir up” (strife) or pick a quarrel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-18.htm" title="A wrathful man stirs up strife: but he that is slow to anger appeases strife.">Proverbs 15:18</a>).

(see R.V. and marg.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">fall</span> <span class="bld">because of thee</span>] or perhaps “fall upon thee” to his own ruin (cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm" title="And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.">Isaiah 8:14</a> f.). R.V. marg. suggests “fall away to thee,” i.e. go over to thy side, which is the sense given by some of the ancient versions. The phrase has this meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-9.htm" title="He that stays in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goes out, and falls to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be to him for a prey.">Jeremiah 21:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-14.htm" title="Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans.

The commencement of this v. has been a fluctuating one from the earliest times. The Sept. reading is &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;; that of the Targ., S., Jerome, Syriac, and Saad., &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;; and even the Codd. read sometimes &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1502;&#1497;, sometimes &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/24-37.htm">Matthew 24:37</a>, &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x39d;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3b5; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;.&#x3c4;.&#x3bb; - a passage which appears to derive its shape from the one before us, with the reading &#1499;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;, and which is expounded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-26.htm">Luke 17:26</a>). If we read &#1499;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;, the word &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; must refer to the present, as the turning-point between wrath and mercy; but if we read &#1499;&#1497;&#1470;&#1502;&#1497;, &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; denotes the pouring out of wrath in connection with the captivity. Both readings are admissible; and as even the Septuagint, with its &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (from the water), gives an indirect support to the reading &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; as one word, this may probably merit the preference, as the one best sustained. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is ubi, quum, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-13.htm">Numbers 20:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/95-9.htm">Psalm 95:9</a>, etc., although it might also be taken as the correlate of the ke&#772;n which follows, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-22.htm">Jeremiah 33:22</a> (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-8.htm">Isaiah 48:8</a>); and in accordance with the accents, we prefer the former. The present turning-point resembles, in Jehovah's esteem, the days of Noah - those days in which He swore that a flood should not any more come upon the earth (min as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a> and many other passages): for so does He now confirm with an oath His fixed purpose that no such judgment of wrath as that which has just been endured shall ever fall upon Jerusalem again (&#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; denotes threatening with a judicial word, which passes at once into effect, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-20.htm">Isaiah 51:20</a>). Hendewerk has the following quibbling remark here: "What the comparison with the flood is worth, we may gather from the alter history, which shows how soon the new Jerusalem and the renovated state succumbed to the judicial wrath of God again." To this we reply: (1.) That the prophecy refers to the converted Israel of the last days, whose Jerusalem will never be destroyed again. These last days appear to the prophet, according to the general character of all prophecy, as though linked on to the close of the captivity. For throughout all prophecy, along with the far-sightedness imparted by the Spirit, there was also a short-sightedness which the Spirit did not remove; that is to say, the directly divine element of insight into the future was associated with a human element of hope, which was nevertheless also indirectly divine, inasmuch as it subserved the divine plan of salvation; and this hope brought, as it were, the far distant future into the closest proximity with the troubled present. If, the, we keep this in mind, we shall see that it was quite in order for the prophet to behold the final future on the very edge of the present, and not to see the long and undulating way between. (2.) The Israel which has been plunged by the Romans into the present exile of a thousand years is that part of the nation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>), which has thrust away the eternal mercy and the unchangeable covenant of peace; but this rejection has simply postponed, and not prevented, the full realization of the salvation promised to Israel as a people. The covenant still exists, primarily indeed as an offer on the part of Jehovah, so that it rests with Israel whether it shall continued one-sided or not; but all that is wanted on the part of Israel is faith, to enable it to exchange the shifting soil of its present exile for the rocky foundation of that covenant of peace which has encircled the ages since the captivity (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-9.htm">Haggai 2:9</a>), as the covenant with Noah encircled those after the flood with the covenant sign of the rainbow in the cloud. </body></html>
