He is as an angel called <span class= "ital">to </span>an angel’s work. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-1.htm" title="And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.">Judges 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-23.htm" title="Curse you Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse you bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.">Judges 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm" title="Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom you seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom you delight in: behold, he shall come, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:1</a>.) He had before seen the glory of Jehovah, and had been overwhelmed with terror. Now he hears His voice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-4.htm" title="And when he puts forth his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.">John 10:4</a>), and it rouses him to self-consecration and activity.<p><span class= "bld">Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?</span>—The union of the singular and plural in the same sentence is significant. The latter does not admit of being explained as a <span class= "ital">pluralis majestatis, </span>for the great kings of Assyria, and Babylon, and Persia always spoke of themselves in the singular (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, passim</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and the “plural of majesty” was an invention of the servility of the Byzantine court. A partial explanation is found in the fact that here, as elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm" title="And he said, Hear you therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.">1Kings 22:19</a> : <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm" title="Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-1.htm" title="Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.">Job 2:1</a>; and perhaps <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm" title="And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.">Genesis 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-7.htm" title="Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.">Genesis 11:7</a>), Jehovah is represented as a king in council. Christian thought has, however, scarcely erred in believing that the words were as a dim foreshadowing of the truth, afterwards to be revealed, of a plurality within the Unity. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-3.htm" title="And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.">Isaiah 6:3</a>.) <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm" title="The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.">Psalm 110:1</a>, which Isaiah may have known, suggested at least a duality. The question reveals to the prophet that there is a work to be done for Jehovah, that He needs an instrument for that work. It is implied that no angel out of the whole host, no man out of the whole nation, offers to undertake it. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-3.htm" title="I have trodden the wine press alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in my anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled on my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.">Isaiah 63:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-5.htm" title="And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore my own arm brought salvation to me; and my fury, it upheld me.">Isaiah 63:5</a>.) The prophet, with the ardour for work which follows on the sense of pardon, volunteers for it before he knows what it is. He reaches in one moment the supreme height <span class= "ital">of </span>the faith which went forth, not knowing whither it went (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-8.htm" title="By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing where he went.">Hebrews 11:8</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-8.htm" title="Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?

The prophet, standing outside the temple, sees the Divine Presence seated on the mercy-seat, raised over the ark of the covenant, between the cherubim and seraphim, and the Divine glory filled the whole temple. See God upon his throne. This vision is explained, Joh 12:41, that Isaiah now saw Christ's glory, and spake of Him, which is a full proof that our Saviour is God. In Christ Jesus, God is seated on a throne of grace; and through him the way into the holiest is laid open. See God's temple, his church on earth, filled with his glory. His train, the skirts of his robes, filled the temple, the whole world, for it is all God's temple. And yet he dwells in every contrite heart. See the blessed attendants by whom his government is served. Above the throne stood the holy angels, called seraphim, which means burners; they burn in love to God, and zeal for his glory against sin. The seraphim showing their faces veiled, declares that they are ready to yield obedience to all God's commands, though they do not understand the secret reasons of his counsels, government, or promises. All vain-glory, ambition, ignorance, and pride, would be done away by one view of Christ in his glory. This awful vision of the Divine Majesty overwhelmed the prophet with a sense of his own vileness. We are undone if there is not a Mediator between us and this holy God. A glimpse of heavenly glory is enough to convince us that all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags. Nor is there a man that would dare to speak to the Lord, if he saw the justice, holiness, and majesty of God, without discerning his glorious mercy and grace in Jesus Christ. The live coal may denote the assurance given to the prophet, of pardon, and acceptance in his work, through the atonement of Christ. Nothing is powerful to cleanse and comfort the soul, but what is taken from Christ's satisfaction and intercession. The taking away sin is necessary to our speaking with confidence and comfort, either to God in prayer, or from God in preaching; and those shall have their sin taken away who complain of it as a burden, and see themselves in danger of being undone by it. It is great comfort to those whom God sends, that they go for God, and may therefore speak in his name, assured that he will bear them out.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The voice of the Lord - Hebrew: "The voice of Yahweh." He had before been addressed by one of the seraphim.<p>Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? - The change of number here, from the singular to the plural, is very remarkable. Jerome, on this place, says that it indicates the 'sacrament' of the Trinity. The Septuagint renders it, 'whom shall I send, and who will go to this people?' The Chaldee, 'whom shall I send to prophesy, and who will go to teach?' The Syriac, 'whom shall I send, and who will go?' The Arabic has followed the Septuagint. The use of the plural pronouns "we and us," as applicable to God, occurs several times in the Old Testament. Thus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a> : 'And God said, Let us make man in our image;' <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/11-6.htm">Genesis 11:6-7</a> : 'And Jehovah said, Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language.' Such a use of the name of God in the plural is very common, but it is not clear that there is a reference to the doctrine of the Trinity. In some cases, it is evident that it cannot have such a reference, and that no "argument" can be drawn from the use of that plural form in favor of such a doctrine.<p>Thus, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-4.htm">Isaiah 19:4</a>, the expression 'a cruel lord,' is in the Hebrew in the plural, yet evidently denoting but one. The expression translated 'the most Holy One,' or 'the Holy,' is in the plural in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-3.htm">Proverbs 30:3</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-16.htm">1 Samuel 19:16</a>, the plural form is applied to a "household god," or an image; and the plural form is applied to God in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/30-25.htm">Job 30:25</a>, 'my Makers' (Hebrew); <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:1</a>, 'thy Creators' (Heb,); <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5</a>, 'Yahweh is thy keepers' (Hebrew); see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-2.htm">Isaiah 22:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-5.htm">Isaiah 43:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-5.htm">Isaiah 62:5</a>. This is called by grammarians pluralis excellentice, or the plural form indicating majesty or honor. It is, in all countries, used in reference to kings and princes; and as God often represents himself as a "king" in the Scriptures, and speaks in the language that was usually applied to kings in oriental countries, no argument can be drawn from expressions like these in defense of the doctrine of the Trinity. There are unanswerable arguments enough in support of that doctrine, without resorting to those which are of doubtful authority.<p>That there are clearer intimations of the doctrines of the Trinity, than that contained in this and similar texts, is indubitable; but we must not set aside the early and somewhat obscure intimations of a doctrine, simply because it comes afterward to be exhibited with more fulness. Such is the plan of revelation; and, instead of despising early announcements, or deeming them useless, because better "proofs" of the doctrine in question can be found, we ought to admire the wisdom and goodness of God in this gradual development of truth. The same interest belongs to the work of thus tracing the rise and progress of truth in the Bible, as belongs to that of him who traces rivers to their fountain head, and proves that, far up amid mountains all but inaccessible, rises the tiny stream, on whose broad waters, as it nears the sea, navies float in proud array. No more visible, in its earlier outflowings, is this doctrine of the Trinity; yet by and by it is the element on which Christianity doats, and in which it lives and moves. Thus we see the unity and harmony of revelation in 11 ages; the doctrine is the same; the degree of manifestation only is different. The necessity of preserving and exhibiting this unity, gives to these early intimations an unspeakable importance; though some, through an excess of candor, would abandon them to the enemy. This text, and its parallels, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-22.htm">Genesis 3:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/11-7.htm">Genesis 11:7</a>, exhibit the Trinity in Revelation's dawn indistinctly - partially disclosed - revealing only a "plurality" of persons. As the light increases, the "three" persons are seen moving under the lifting shadows, until, in the New Testament, baptism is commanded in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; and the existence and functions of each person are clearly unfolded.<p>The problem is, to account for the use of the plural number in these passages, consistently with the unity of God. The doctrine of the Trinity seems to furnish an easy and beautiful solution; but this solution has been rejected, not by Unitarians only, but by Trinitarians not a few. Various hypotheses have been offered: as, that in the creation of man <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>, God associated with himself the heavens and the earth; or, that he consulted with angels; or, meant simply to indicate the importance of the work; or, perhaps, to supply a lesson of deliberation! These crudities are by most, however, long ago abandoned as untenable; and the solution most generally approved by such as reject that of the Trinity, is that furnished by an appeal to the "style of majesty." Oriental princes, it is alleged, from the most ancient times, used the plural number in publishing their decrees; and such is the style of royalty to this day. But, unfortunately for this theory, there is no evidence whatever that ancient potentates employed this style. "The use of the plural number by kings and princes, is quite a modern invention." The Bible does not furnish any example of it. Nor is there any evidence that God himself, on especially solemn occasions, keeping out of sight, of course, the text in question, used such style; there is abundant evidence to the contrary, the singular number being used by Yahweh in the most sublime and awful declarations.<p>Besides this strange use of the plural number on the part of God himself, plural names (&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'eloh&#305;&#770;ym, &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;  'a&#774;do&#770;na&#770;y&#305;&#770;m) are frequently given to him by the writers of the Bible; the instances in which these names occur in the singular form, are the exceptions. The name usually rendered "God" in the English Bible, is almost invariably plural - &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'eloh&#305;&#770;ym, Gods. That these plural forms are used of idols, as well as of the true God, is admitted; but as the special names of the true God came, in process of time, to be applied to idols, so would the special "form" of these names, and to tell us that these forms "are" so applied, is quite beside the question. We wish to know why, originally, such forms were applied to the "true" God; and it is no answer to tell us they are also applied to idols. 'There is nothing more wonderful in the name being so used in the plural form, than in its being so used at all.<p>The same principle which accounts for the name God being given to pagan deities at all, will equally well account for its being given to them in the particular form in which it is applied to the true God.' - "Wardlaw." This is pointed and decisive; and renders it needless to speculate here on the mode in which the name, or the plural form of it, came to be transferred to false gods, or great men. On this point, see Dr. John Pye Smith's "Scripture testimony to the Messiah." It is further remarkable, that these plural appellatives are, for the most part combined with verbs and adjectives in the singular number; as, 'Gods (he) created,' <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>; and with plural adjuncts but rarely. Now, the ordinary rule of grammar might have been followed invariably, as well as in these few instances, or the departures from it might have been but few in number. That this is not the case, implies the existence of some very cogent reason, and cannot be regarded as the result, merely, of accident.<p>To account for the use of these plural names, our author has recourse to what is called the pluralis majestaticus, or excellentiae, according to which, nouns of dignity and majesty, in Hebrew, are said to be used in the plural form. But the existence of this pluralis majestaticus has never been proved. Its defense is now abandoned by the most skillful grammarians. Ewald repudiates it. And it is not a little remarkable, that some of the examples most relied on for proof of this "dignified plural," are found, on examination, to possess nothing of the dignity, while more exact scholarship has reduced their plurality also. The examples alluded to, are, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-29.htm">Exodus 21:29</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-34.htm">Exodus 21:34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-10.htm">Exodus 22:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-13.htm">Exodus 22:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>; where the supposed plural form denotes the owner of oxen, of sheep, and of asses! - fit parties, doubtless, to be honored with the pluralis majestaticus. In truth, leaving out of view the plural appellatives applied to the Deity, that is, the appellatives in question, and which, therefore, cannot be adduced, there is no evidence whatever of this pretended rule. Had any rule of the kind existed, we should, without doubt, have found it exemplified, when kings, princes, nobles, generals, priests, and prophets figure on the sacred pages. That the pluralis excellentiae is not applied to them, is sufficient proof of its nonexistence; and should dispose rational and candid inquirers to acquiesce in the solution of the grammatical anomalies we have been considering, that is furnished by the doctrine of Trinity in Unity - the solution which, to say the least of it, is beset with fewest difficulties.<p>The language here idicates the "design" for which this vision was shown to Isaiah. It was to commission him to exhibit truth that would be extremely unpleasant to the nation, and that would have the certain effect of hardening their hearts. In view of the nature and effect of this message, God is represented as inquiring who would be willing to undertake it? Who had courage enough to do it? Who would risk his life? And it indicates, perhaps, that there were "few" in the nation who would be willing to do it, and that it was attended with self-denial and danger.<p>Here am I-- This shows at once his confidence in God, and his zeal. He had been qualified for it by the extraordinary commission, and he was now ready to bear the message to his countrymen. In this attitude "we" should stand, prompt to deliver "any" message that God shall entrust to our hands, and to engage in "any" service that he calls on us to perform. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

We do not know what special call Isaiah had had previously. Perhaps he had been brought up in the "schools of the prophets." Perhaps, when the "word of the Lord" came to him, he had accepted the fact as sufficient call. Now, however, he had, in vision, a clear and distinct call and mission (vers. 8, 9). He was told to "go," and instructed as to what he was to say (vers. 9, 10). As before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1.htm">Isaiah 1-5</a>.), while in the main he was to denounce woe, he was still to proclaim the survival of a remnant (vers. 10-12). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whom shall I send?</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-20.htm">1 Kings 20:20</a>).

We must not render &#1500;&#1493; &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; "near him;" for although &#1506;&#1500; or &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; is applied to a person standing near or over against another who is sitting down (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-21.htm">Jeremiah 36:21</a>; compared <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-19.htm">2 Chronicles 26:19</a>, where the latter is used to signify "over against" the altar of incense), and is used in this sense to denote the attitude of spirits (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-16.htm">Job 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-5.htm">Zechariah 6:5</a>), and even of men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-14.htm">Zechariah 4:14</a>), in relation to God when seated on His throne, in which case it cannot possibly be employed in the sense of "towering above;" yet &#1500;&#1493; &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, the strongest expression for supra, cannot be employed in any other than a literal sense here; for which reason Rashi and the Targums understand it as signifying "above in the attitude of service," and the accentuation apparently, though erroneously, implies this (Luzzatto). What Isaiah meant by this standing above, may be inferred from the use which the seraphim are said to have made of their wings. The imperfects do not describe what they were accustomed to do (Bttcher and others), but what the seer saw them do: with two of their six wings he saw them fly. Thus they stood flying, i.e., they hovered or soared (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-14.htm">Numbers 14:14</a>), as both the earth and stars are said to stand, although suspended in space (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-7.htm">Job 26:7</a>). The seraphim would not indeed tower above the head of Him that sat upon the throne, but they hovered above the robe belonging to Him with which the hall was filled, sustained by two extended wings, and covering their faces with two other wings in their awe at the divine glory (Targ. ne videant), and their feet with two others, in their consciousness of the depth at which the creature stands below the Holiest of all (Targ. ne videantur), just as the cherubim are described as veiling their bodies in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-11.htm">Ezekiel 1:11</a>. This is the only passage in the Scriptures in which the seraphim are mentioned. According to the orthodox view, which originated with Dionysius the Areopagite, they stand at the head of the nine choirs of angels, the first rank consisting of seraphim, cherubim, and throni. And this is not without support, if we compare the cherubim mentioned in Ezekiel, which carried the chariot of the divine throne; whereas here the seraphim are said to surround the seat on which the Lord was enthroned. In any case, the seraphim and cherubim were heavenly beings of different kinds; and there is no weight in the attempts made by Hendewerk and Stickel to prove that they are one and the same. And certainly the name serpahim does not signify merely spirits as such, but even, if not the highest of all, yet a distinct order from the rest; for the Scriptures really teach that there are gradations in rank in the hierarchy of heaven. Nor were they mere symbols or fanciful images, as Hvernick imagines, but real spiritual beings, who visibly appeared to the prophet, and that in a form corresponding to their own supersensuous being, and to the design of the whole transaction. Whilst these seraphim hovered above on both sides of Him that sat upon the throne, and therefore formed two opposite choirs, each ranged in a semicircle, they presented antiphonal worship to Him that sat upon the throne. </body></html>
