How long shall all this last? So a later prophet, towards the close of the seventy years of exile, cried once again, “How long?” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-13.htm" title="Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said to that certain saint which spoke, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?">Daniel 8:13</a>). So the cry, “How long, O Lord, dost thou not judge?” came from the souls beneath the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm" title="And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, do you not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?">Revelation 6:10</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant.</span>—The words answer the immediate question of the prophet within its horizon. They suggest an answer to all analogous questions. Stroke after stroke must come, judgment after judgment, till the sin has been adequately punished; but the darkness of the prospect, terrible as it is, does not exclude the glimmer of an eternal hope for the far-off future.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/6-11.htm" title="Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,...">Isaiah 6:11-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then said I, Lord, how long? — </span>An abrupt speech, arising from the prophet’s great passion and astonishment: how long shall this dreadful judgment last? <span class="ital">Until the cities be wasted, </span>&c. — Until this land be totally destroyed, first by the Babylonians, and afterward by the Romans. <span class="ital">And the Lord have removed men far away </span>— Hath caused this people to be carried away captive into far countries. <span class="ital">And there be a great forsaking</span> — Till houses and lands be generally forsaken of their owners. The reader wilt observe, “There is a remarkable gradation in denouncing these judgments; not only Jerusalem and the cities should be <span class="ital">wasted without inhabitant, </span>but even the single houses should be <span class="ital">without man; </span>and not only the houses of the cities, but even the country should <span class="ital">be utterly desolate; </span>and not only the people should be removed out of the <span class="ital">land, </span>but <span class="ital">the Lord </span>should <span class="ital">remove them far away; </span>and they should not be removed for a short period, but there should <span class="ital">be a great, </span>or rather, <span class="ital">a long forsaking in the midst of the land. </span>And hath not the world seen all these particulars exactly fulfilled? Have not the Jews laboured under a spiritual blindness and infatuation, in <span class="ital">hearing, </span>but <span class="ital">not understanding, </span>in <span class="ital">seeing, </span>but <span class="ital">not perceiving </span>the Messiah, after the accomplishment of so many prophecies, after the performance of so many miracles? And, in consequence of their refusal to <span class="ital">convert and be healed, </span>have not <span class="ital">their cities been wasted without inhabitants, and their houses without man? </span>Have they not been <span class="ital">removed far away into </span>the most distant parts of the earth? and hath not their removal, or banishment, been now of above 1700 years duration? And do they not still continue deaf and blind, obstinate and unbelieving? The Jews, at the time of the delivery of this prophecy, gloried in being the peculiar church and people of God; and would any Jew, of himself, have thought or have said, that his nation would, in process of time, become an infidel and reprobate nation; infidel and reprobate for many ages, oppressed by man, and forsaken of God? It was above 750 years before Christ that Isaiah predicted these things; and how could he have predicted them, unless he had been illuminated by the divine vision; or could they have succeeded accordingly, unless the Spirit of prophecy had been the Spirit of God?” See Bishop Newton <span class="ital">on the Prophecies, </span>vol. 1. p. 233.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:9-13 God sends Isaiah to foretell the ruin of his people. Many hear the sound of God's word, but do not feel the power of it. God sometimes, in righteous judgment, gives men up to blindness of mind, because they will not receive the truth in the love of it. But no humble inquirer after Christ, need to fear this awful doom, which is a spiritual judgment on those who will still hold fast their sins. Let every one pray for the enlightening of the Holy Spirit, that he may perceive how precious are the Divine mercies, by which alone we are secured against this dreadful danger. Yet the Lord would preserve a remnant, like the tenth, holy to him. And blessed be God, he still preserves his church; however professors or visible churches may be lopped off as unfruitful, the holy seed will shoot forth, from whom all the numerous branches of righteousness shall arise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>How long - The prophet did not dare to pray that this effect should not follow.

Isaiah assumes that he has not heard as yet God's final purpose; that there is some merciful intention kept in reserve, which is to take effect after the close of the period of judgment. <span class="cmt_word">The cities... the houses;</span> rather, <span class="accented">cities</span>... <span class="accented">houses</span>. An entire desolation of the whole land, and extermination of its inhabitants, is not prophesied, and never took place. Nebuchadnezzar "left of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-12.htm">2 Kings 25:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-10.htm">Jeremiah 39:10</a>). Even when the great mass of these persons went into Egypt and perished there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-11.htm">Jeremiah 44:11-27</a>), a certain number escaped and returned to Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-14.htm">Jeremiah 44:14, 28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The land</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the ground</span>, <span class="accented">the soil</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The seer, who was at first overwhelmed and intoxicated by the majestic sight, now recovers his self-consciousness."Then said I, Woe to me! for I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I am dwelling among a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts." That a man cannot see God without dying is true in itself, and was an Old Testament conviction throughout (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>, etc.). He must die, because the holiness of God is to the sinner a consuming fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-14.htm">Isaiah 33:14</a>); and the infinite distance between the creature and the Creator is sufficient of itself to produce a prostrating effect, which even the seraphim could not resist without veiling their faces. Isaiah therefore regarded himself as lost (nidme&#772;thi, like &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;, perii, a preterite denoting the fact which, although not outwardly completed, is yet effected so far as a man's own consciousness is concerned), and all the more because he himself was of unclean lips, and he was also a member of a nation of unclean lips. The unholiness of his own person was doubled, in consequence of the closeness of the natural connection, by the unholiness of the nation to which he belonged. He designates this unholiness as uncleanness of lips, because he found himself transported into the midst of choirs of beings who were praising the Lord with pure lips; and he calls the King Jehovah, because, although he had not seen Jehovah face to face, he had seen the throne, and the all-filling robe, and the seraphim who surrounded and did homage to Him that sat upon the throne; and therefore, as he had seen the heavenly King in His revealed majesty, he describes the scene according to the impression that he had received. But to stand here in front of Jehovah of hosts, the exalted King, to whom everything does homage, and to be obliged to remain mute in the consciousness of deep uncleanness, excited within him the annihilating anguish of self-condemnation. And this is expressed in the confession made by the contrite seer. </body></html>
