All is chaotic and anarchic; a fierce struggle for existence; the established order of society subverted; the experience of age derided by the petulance of youth. The picture of the corruption of a monarchy is as vivid and complete in its way as that which Thucydides (3:82-84) draws of the corruption of a democracy. It might seem to have been drawn from the Turkey or the Egypt of our own time.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-9 God was about to deprive Judah of every stay and support. The city and the land were to be made desolate, because their words and works had been rebellious against the Lord; even at his holy temple. If men do not stay themselves upon God, he will soon remove all other supports, and then they must sink. Christ is the Bread of life and the Water of life; if he be our Stay, we shall find that is a good part not to be taken away, Joh 6:27. Here note, 1. That the condition of sinners is exceedingly woful. 2. It is the soul that is damaged by sin. 3. Whatever evil befals sinners, be sure that they bring it on themselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the people shall be oppressed - This describes the state of anarchy and confusion which would exist under the reign of children and babes <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-4.htm">Isaiah 3:4</a>, when all law would be powerless, and all rights violated, and when the feeble would be oppressed and borne down by the strong. The word used here, properly denotes that "unjust exactions or demands" would be made, or that the people would be "urged" to fulfill them.<p>Every one by another - In turn they shall oppress and vex one another. Hebrew 'man by man; and man by his neighbor' - a strong mode of expression, denoting that there would be a state of mutual strife, and violation of rights; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-20.htm">1 Kings 20:20</a>.<p>The child ... - All ranks of society shall be broken up. All respect due from one rank in life to another shall be violated.<p>Shall behave himself proudly - The word used here means rather to "urge," or "press on." The child shall "crowd on" the old man. This was particularly descriptive of a state of anarchy and disorder, from the fact that the Jews inculcated so much respect and deference for age; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-2.htm">Isaiah 3:2</a>.<p>The ancient - The old man.<p>And the base - The man of low rank in life. The word properly means the man that is despised, the vile, the ignoble; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-23.htm">1 Samuel 18:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-9.htm">Proverbs 7:9</a>.<p>The honorable - All the forms of respect in life would be broken up; all the proper rules of deference between man and man would be violated.

Thus ends the fourth strophe of this "dies irae, dies illa," which is appended to the earlier prophetic word. But there follows, as an epiphonem, this nota bene in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-22.htm">Isaiah 2:22</a> : Oh, then, let man go, in whose nose is a breath; for what is he estimated at? The Septuagint leaves this v. out altogether. But was it so utterly unintelligible then? Jerome adopted a false pointing, and has therefore given this marvellous rendering: excelsus (ba&#770;ma&#770;h!) reputatus est ipse, by which Luther was apparently misled. But if we look backwards and forwards, it is impossible to mistake the meaning of the verse, which must be regarded not only as the resultant of what precedes it, but also as the transition to what follows. It is preceded by the prediction of the utter demolition of everything which ministers to the pride and vain confidence of men; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>. the same prediction is resumed, with a more special reference to the Jewish state, from which Jehovah is about to take away every prop, so that it shall utterly collapse. Accordingly the prophet exhorts, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-22.htm">Isaiah 2:22</a>, to a renunciation of trust in man, and everything belonging to him, just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-8.htm">Psalm 118:8-9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5</a>. The construction is as general as that of a gnome. The dat. Commodi &#1500;&#1499;&#1501; (Ges. 154, 3, e) renders the exhortation both friendly and urgent: from regard to yourselves, for your own good, for your own salvation, desist from man, i.e., from your confidence in him, in whose nose (in cujus naso, the singular, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-3.htm">Job 27:3</a>; whereas the plural is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a> in the same sense, in nares ejus, "into his nostrils") is a breath, a breath of life, which God gave to him, and can take back as soon as He will (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-14.htm">Job 34:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>). Upon the breath, which passes out and in through his nose, his whole earthly existence is suspended; and this, when once lost, is gone for ever (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-7.htm">Job 7:7</a>). It is upon this breath, therefore, that all the confidence placed in man must rest - a bad soil and foundation! Under these conditions, and with this liability to perish in a moment, the worth of man as a ground of confidence is really nothing. This thought is expressed here in the form of a question: At (for) what is he estimated, or to be estimated? The passive participle nechsha&#770;b combines with the idea of the actual (aestimatus) that of the necessary (aestimandus), and also of the possible or suitable (aestimabilis); and that all the more because the Semitic languages have no special forms for the latter notions. The Beth is Beth pret&#305;&#772;, corresponding to the Latin genitive (quanti) or ablative (quanto) - a modification of the Beth instrumenti, the price being regarded as the medium of exchange or purchase: "at what is he estimated," not with what is he compared, which would be expressed by &#8219;eth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>; compare &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-37.htm">Luke 22:37</a>) or &#8219;im (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-5.htm">Psalm 88:5</a>). The word is &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, not &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, because this looser form is only found in cases where a relative clause follows (eo quod, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>), and not bama equals h, because this termination with a&#772; is used exclusively where the next word begins with Aleph, or where it is a pausal word (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-21.htm">1 Kings 22:21</a>); in every other case we have bammeh. The question introduced with this quanto (quanti), "at what," cannot be answered by any positive definition of value. The worth of man, regarded in himself, and altogether apart from God, is really nothing. <p>The proclamation of judgment pauses at this porisma, but only for the purpose of gathering fresh strength. The prophet has foretold in four strophes the judgment of God upon every exalted thing in the kosmos that has fallen away from communion with God, just as Amos commences his book with a round of judgments, which are uttered in seven strophes of uniform scope, bursting like seven thunder-claps upon the nations of the existing stage of history. The seventh stroke falls upon Judah, over which the thunderstorm rests after finding such abundant booty. And in the same manner Isaiah, in the instance before us, reduces the universal proclamation of judgment to one more especially affecting Judah and Jerusalem. The current of the address breaks through the bounds of the strophe; and the exhortation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-22.htm">Isaiah 2:22</a> not to trust in man, the reason for which is assigned in what precedes, also forms a transition from the universal proclamation of judgment to the more special one in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>, where the prophet assigns a fresh ground for the exhortation. </body></html>
