"Prof. Alexander." This was fully accomplished in the time of Nebuchadnezzar; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14</a>.<p>And the prudent - This word in the original - &#1511;&#1505;&#1501;  qose&#772;m - means properly "a diviner," or a "soothsayer." But it is sometimes used in a good sense; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-10.htm">Proverbs 16:10</a>, "margin." The Chaldee understands it of a man "who is consulted," or whose opinion is asked, in times of perplexity or danger. The word was originally applied to false prophets, diviners, and soothsayers, who claimed the power of looking into futurity. It came, however, to denote also the man of sagacity, the statesman, the experienced counselor, who from the records of the past could judge of the future, and to whom, therefore, the nation could look in times of perplexity and danger. Vitringa supposes that it may refer here to the false prophets on whose advice the nation might be relying.<p>The ancient - The old man. Such men, especially among the Hebrews, were deemed particularly qualified to give advice. They had experience; they kept the traditions of their fathers; they had conversed with the wise of the preceding generation; and in a land where there were few books, and knowledge was to be gained mainly by conversation and experience, great respect was shown them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-32.htm">Leviticus 19:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-17.htm">2 Chronicles 31:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-6.htm">1 Kings 12:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-8.htm">1 Kings 12:8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

The meaning is either that these should die in war, as thousands of them did; or that men fit to be generals of armies should be removed by death before this time, so that they should have none to go out with their armies, and meet the enemy: <p>the judge and the prophet; there should be none to sit upon the bench, and administer justice to the people in civil affairs, and to determine causes relating to life and death; and none to instruct them in religious matters, and deliver the mind and will of God to them; and before this time the Jews were under the Roman jurisdiction, and had a Roman governor over them, and had not power to judge in capital cases, in matters of life and death, as they suggest, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-31.htm">John 18:31</a> and they say (z), that forty years before the destruction of the temple this power was taken from them; and at the time that Jerusalem was besieged, and taken by the Romans, and before that, they had no prophets among them; for though there were prophets in the Christian churches, yet none among them; this shows that this prophecy cannot be understood of the Babylonish captivity, because there were prophets then, as Jeremy, Ezekiel, and Daniel, but of Jerusalem's destruction by the Romans: <p>and the prudent and the ancient: with whom are wisdom, and who are fit to give advice and counsel in matters of difficulty; but these would be removed by famine or sword.
