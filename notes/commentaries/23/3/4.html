In an Eastern monarchy the rule of a young king, rash and without experience, guided by counsellors like himself, was naturally regarded as the greatest of evils, and the history of Rehoboam had impressed this truth on the mind of every Israelite.

The word rendered “babes” is really an abstract noun, occurring again only in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-4.htm" title="I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears on them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke, they did not hear: but they did evil before my eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.">Isaiah 66:4</a> (A.V. “delusions”). It is derived from a verb meaning “to outrage” or “to insult” (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-25.htm" title="But the men would not listen to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth to them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.">Jdg 19:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-4.htm" title="Then said Saul to his armor bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armor bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell on it.">1 Samuel 31:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-19.htm" title="And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.">Jeremiah 38:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-29.htm" title="And Balaam said to the ass, Because you have mocked me: I would there were a sword in my hand, for now would I kill you.">Numbers 22:29</a>), and seems here to denote those personal affronts and outrages which invariably accompany social confusions. The rendering “capriciousness,” preferred by many, does not suit <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-4.htm" title="I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears on them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke, they did not hear: but they did evil before my eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.">Isaiah 66:4</a>. Some take the word as adverbial acc. (see R.V. marg. “with childishness shall they rule”), others think the abstract is used for the concrete (“capricious youths”). But the translation given is perhaps the most forcible,—Outrage instead of Justice.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will give children</span> <span class="cmt_word">to be their princes</span>; rather, <span class="accented">youths</span> than "children." The extreme youth of the later kings of Judah at the date of their accession is very remarkable. After Hezekiah, only one was as much as twenty-five years old when he came to the throne. Jehoahaz was twenty-three (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31</a>); Amon, twenty-two (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-19.htm">2 Kings 21:19</a>); Zedekiah twenty-one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-18.htm">2 Kings 24:18</a>); Jehoiachin, eighteen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>); Manasseh, twelve (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-1.htm">2 Kings 21:1</a>); and Josiah eight (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-1.htm">2 Kings 22:1</a>). Thus this prophecy was fulfilled to the letter. <span class="cmt_word">And babes shall rule over them</span>; literally, <span class="accented">puerilities shall rule over them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the youths shall behave in a childish way. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-20.htm">Isaiah 2:20</a> forms the commencement to the fourth strophe: "In that day will a man cast away his idols of gold and his idols of silver, which they made for him to worship, to the moles and to the bats." The traditional text separates lachpor peroth into two words,<p>(Note: Abulwali equals d Parchon and others regard the double word as the singular of a substantive, applied to a particular bird (possibly a woodpecker), as a pecker of fruit (peroth). Kimchi would rather take lachpor as an infinitive (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-2.htm">Joshua 2:2</a>), to dig pits; and compares with it the talmudic word pe&#772;r, a pit or grave. No one adopts the rendering "into mouse-holes," simply because pe&#772;rah, a mouse (from an Arabic word fa'ara, to dig, or root up), was not a Hebrew word at all, but was adopted at a later period from the Arabic (hence the Hebraeo-Arabic purah, a mousetrap).)<p>though without its being possible to discover what they are supposed to mean. The reason for the separation was simply the fact that plurilitera were at one time altogether misunderstood and regarded as Composita: for other plurilitera, written as two words, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-18.htm">Hosea 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-20.htm">Jeremiah 46:20</a>. The prophet certainly pronounced the word lachparpa&#770;roth (Ewald, 157, c); and Chapharpa&#770;ra&#770;h is apparently a mole (lit. thrower up of the soil), talpa, as it is rendered by Jerome and interpreted by Rashi. Gesenius and Knobel, however, have raised this objection, that the mole is never found in houses. But are we necessarily to assume that they would throw their idols into lumber-rooms, and not hide them in holes and crevices out of doors? The mole, the shrew-mouse, and the bat, whose name (atalleph) is regarded by Schultens as a compound word (atal-eph, night-bird), are generically related, according to both ancient and modern naturalists. Bats are to birds what moles are to the smaller beasts of prey (vid., Levysohn, Zoologie des Talmud, p. 102). The lxx combine with these two words l'hishtachavoth (to worship). Malbim and Luzzatto adopt this rendering, and understand the words to mean that they would sink down to the most absurd descriptions of animal worship. But the accentuation, which does not divide the v. at &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;&#1500;&#1493;, as we should expect if this were the meaning, is based upon the correct interpretation. The idolaters, convinced of the worthlessness of their idols through the judicial interposition of God, and enraged at the disastrous manner in which they had been deceived, would throw away with curses the images of gold and silver which artists' hands had made according to their instructions, and hide them in the holes of bats and in mole-hills, to conceal them from the eyes of the Judge, and then take refuge there themselves after ridding themselves of this useless and damnable burden. </body></html>
