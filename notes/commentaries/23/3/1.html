So we have the “staff of bread” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-26.htm" title="And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and you shall eat, and not be satisfied.">Leviticus 26:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-16.htm" title="Moreover he called for a famine on the land: he broke the whole staff of bread.">Psalm 105:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-16.htm" title="Moreover he said to me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:">Ezekiel 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-16.htm" title="When I shall send on them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine on you, and will break your staff of bread:">Ezekiel 5:16</a>. Possibly, however, the interpretation is of the nature of a marginal gloss, which has found its way into the text, and “the stay and staff” (in the Hebrew the latter word is the feminine form of the former) are really identified with the “pillars of the state,” the great women as well as the great men who are named afterwards. On the other hand, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-7.htm" title="In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.">Isaiah 3:7</a> implies the pressure of famine, and the prophet may have intended to paint the complete failure of all resources, both material and political.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm" title="For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, does take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water.">Isaiah 3:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">For, </span>&c. — The prophet, having in the preceding chapter declared, in general terms, the terror of the day of the Lord, now descends to a more particular explication, and special confirmation of what he had advanced concerning it. <span class="ital">Behold — </span>Look upon what follows to be as certain as if it were already accomplished; <span class="ital">the Lord doth take away, &c., the stay and the staff </span>— All their supports, of what kind soever; all the things they trust to, and look for help and relief from; <span class="ital">the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water </span>— Bread is commonly called the staff of life: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-26.htm" title="And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and you shall eat, and not be satisfied.">Leviticus 26:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-13.htm" title="Son of man, when the land sins against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out my hand on it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine on it, and will cut off man and beast from it:">Ezekiel 14:13</a>. But by bread and water here are meant all kinds of aliment, whereby the body is supported. This judgment seems to relate especially to the siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans, when bread and water were both very scarce: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/14-1.htm" title="The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth....">Jeremiah 14:1-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-21.htm" title="Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent.

The city and the land were to be made desolate, because their words and works had been rebellious against the Lord; even at his holy temple. If men do not stay themselves upon God, he will soon remove all other supports, and then they must sink. Christ is the Bread of life and the Water of life; if he be our Stay, we shall find that is a good part not to be taken away, Joh 6:27. Here note, 1. That the condition of sinners is exceedingly woful. 2. It is the soul that is damaged by sin. 3.

The same prophecy is continued, and the force of the argument of the prophet will not be seen unless the chapters are read together; see the Analysis prefixed to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2.htm">Isaiah 2</a>. In the close of the second chapter <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-22.htm">Isaiah 2:22</a>, the prophet had cautioned his countrymen against confiding in man. In this chapter, a reason is given here why they should cease to do it - to wit, that God would soon take away their kings and princes.<p>The Lord - &#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;  ha&#772;'a&#770;do&#770;n; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>.<p>The Lord of hosts - see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>. The prophet calls the attention of the Jews particularly to the fact that this was about to be done by Yahweh "of hosts" - a title which he gives to God when he designs to indicate that that which is to be done implies special strength, power, and majesty. As the work which was now to be done was the removal of the mighty men on which the nation was depending, it is implied that it was a work of power which belonged especially to the God of armies - the Almighty.<p>Doth take away - Is about to remove. In the Hebrew, the word here is a "participle," and does not mark the precise time. It has reference here, however, to the future.<p>From Jerusalem ... - Note <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>.<p>The stay - In the Hebrew, the words translated "stay" and "staff" are the same, with the exception that the former is in the masculine, and the latter in the feminine gender. The meaning is, that God would remove "all kinds of support," or "everything" on which they relied. The reference is undoubtedly to the princes and mighty men on whose counsels and aid the nation was resting for defense; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-2.htm">Isaiah 3:2-3</a>.<p>The whole stay of bread - We use a similar expression when we say that "bread is the staff of life." The Hebrews often expressed the same idea, representing the "heart" in man as being "supported or upheld" by bread, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-5.htm">Genesis 18:5</a> (margin); <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-5.htm">Judges 19:5</a> (margin); <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-16.htm">Psalm 105:16</a>.<p>Stay of water - He would reduce them from their luxuries introduced by commerce <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2.htm">Isaiah 2</a> to absolute want. This often occurred in the sieges and wars of the nation; and in the famines which were the consequence of the wars. The reference here is probably to the invasion of the land by Nebuchadnezzar. The famine consequent on that invasion is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-21.htm">Jeremiah 38:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-9.htm">Jeremiah 38:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-4.htm">Lamentations 4:4</a> : "The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his month for thirst; the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 3<p>Isa 3:1-26.<p>1.

These titles of Jehovah, expressive of power and authority, are used to show that he is able to execute what he threatens to do; and the word "behold" is prefixed, to excite attention to what is about to be said: <p>doth take away from Jerusalem, and from Judea; the present tense is used for the future, because of the certainty of what would be done to the Jews, both in city and country; for as in the preceding chapter <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-1.htm">Isaiah 2:1</a> it is foretold what shall befall the antichristian party among the nations of the world, this is a prophecy of the destruction of the Jews by the Romans; at which time there would be a dreadful famine, signified by the taking away <p>the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water; bread and water being the stay and staff of man's life, which support and maintain it; and, in case of disobedience, a famine was threatened this people very early, and in much such terms as here, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a> and as there was a very sore famine at the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-6.htm">Jeremiah 52:6</a> so there was a very dreadful one when the city was besieged by the Romans, as related by Josephus, and predicted by Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-7.htm">Matthew 24:7</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the rod <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> and the staff, the whole support of bread, and the whole support of water,</span><p>(a) Because they trusted in their abundance and prosperity he shows that they should be taken from them.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">the Lord, the Lord of hosts</span>] as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-24.htm" title="Therefore said the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries, and avenge me of my enemies:">Isaiah 1:24</a> : <span class="bld">the Sovereign, Jehovah of Hosts</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the stay and the staff</span>] The second word is the fem. form of the first.

The general denunciations against Israel of the two preceding chapters are here turned especially against Jerusalem. God will deprive her of all her superior and more honorable classes (vers. 1-3); and will give her "children" for her rulers (ver. 4).
