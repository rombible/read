It has to be noted, however, (1) that this requires an inversion of the clauses; (2) that it introduces a feature scarcely in harmony with the general drift of the description; (3) that the laws of parallelism require us to take the “rich” of one clause as corresponding to the “wicked” of the other, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as in the sense of the wrongfully rich, the oppressors, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-6.htm" title="They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;">Psalm 49:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-16.htm" title="Be not you afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;">Psalm 49:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/73-3.htm" title="For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.">Psalm 73:3-5</a>. Men assigned to the Servant not the burial of a saint, with reverence and honour (such, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>as that of Stephen, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-2.htm" title="And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.">Acts 8:2</a>), but that of an unjust oppressor, for whom no man lamented, saying, “Ah lord! Ah my brother! Ah his glory!” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-18.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!">Jeremiah 22:18</a>), and this <span class= "ital">although </span>(not “because”) he had done no violence to deserve it. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-17.htm" title="Not for any injustice in my hands: also my prayer is pure.">Job 16:17</a>.) The rendering “because” has been adopted as giving a reason for the honourable burial which, it has been assumed, the words imply. It may be questioned, however, when we remember Isaiah’s words as to Shebna (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-16.htm" title="What have you here? and whom have you here, that you have hewed you out a sepulcher here, as he that hews him out a sepulcher on high, and that engraves an habitation for himself in a rock?">Isaiah 22:16</a>), whether he would have looked on such a burial as that recorded in the Gospels, clandestine, and with no public lamentation, as an adequate recognition of the holiness of the victim. The point of the last two clauses is that they declare emphatically the absolute rectitude of the sufferer in act, his absolute veracity in speech.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/53.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-9.htm" title="And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.">Isaiah 53:9</a></span>. <span class="ital">And he made his grave with the wicked </span>— And although he did not die for his own sins, but only for those of mankind, yet he was willing to die like a malefactor, or like a sinner, as all other men are, and to be put into a grave as they use to be; which was a further degree of his humiliation. He saith, <span class="ital">he made his grave, </span>because this was Christ’s own act, and he willingly yielded up himself to death and burial. And that which follows, <span class="ital">with the wicked, </span>does not denote the sameness of place, as if he should be buried in the same grave with other malefactors, but the sameness of condition. But the words may be rendered, <span class="ital">A grave was appointed for him with the wicked; but he was with the rich at his death. </span>Or, as Bishop Lowth reads it, <span class="ital">His grave was appointed with the wicked; but with the rich man was his tomb. </span>See his notes. “As our Lord was crucified between two thieves, it was doubtless intended he should be buried with them. ‘Thus his grave was appointed with the wicked;’ but Joseph of Arimathea came and asked for his body, and Pilate, convinced that he had committed no crime, readily granted Joseph’s request. Thus ‘he was with the rich at his death,’ that is, till his resurrection: and this took place contrary to the intention of his enemies, <span class="ital">because he had done no violence, </span>&c., for otherwise Joseph would scarcely have requested Pilate, and probably Pilate would not have consented, to deliver up the body of a crucified malefactor.” — Scott. But this latter clause may be connected with the following verse, and rendered, <span class="ital">Although he had done no violence,</span> &c<span class="ital">., yet it pleased the Lord, </span>&c.

It was for our sins, and in our stead, that our Lord Jesus suffered. We have all sinned, and have come short of the glory of God. Sinners have their beloved sin, their own evil way, of which they are fond. Our sins deserve all griefs and sorrows, even the most severe. We are saved from the ruin, to which by sin we become liable, by laying our sins on Christ. This atonement was to be made for our sins. And this is the only way of salvation. Our sins were the thorns in Christ's head, the nails in his hands and feet, the spear in his side. He was delivered to death for our offences. By his sufferings he purchased for us the Spirit and grace of God, to mortify our corruptions, which are the distempers of our souls. We may well endure our lighter sufferings, if He has taught us to esteem all things but loss for him, and to love him who has first loved us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/53.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he made his grave with the wicked - Jerome renders this, Et dabit impios pro sepultura et divitem pro morte sua. The Septuagint renders it, 'I will give the wicked instead of his burial (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;  anti te&#772;s taphe&#772;s), and the rich in the place, or instead of his death' (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  anti tou thanatou). The Chaldee renders it, 'He will deliver the wicked into Gehenna, and the rich in substance who oppress, by a death that is destructive, that the workers of iniquity may no more be established, and that they may no more speak deceit in their mouth.' The Syriac renders it beautifully, 'the wicked gave a grave.' Hengstenberg renders it, 'They appointed him his grave with the wicked (but he was with a rich man after his death); although he had done nothing unrighteous, and there was no guile in his mouth.' The sense, according to him, is, that not satisfied with his sufferings and death, they sought to insult him even in death, since they wished to bury his corpse among criminals. It is then incidentally remarked, that this object was not accomplished. This whole verse is exceedingly important; and every word in it deserves a serious examination, and attentive consideration. It has been subjected to the closest investigation by critics, and different interpretations have been given to it. They may be seen at length in Rosenmuller, Gesenius, and Hengstenberg. The word rendered 'he made' (&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503;  vayite&#772;n, from       &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;  na&#770;than) is a word of very frequent occurrence in the Scriptures. According to Gesenius, it means:<p>1. To give, as:<p>(a) to give the hand to a victor;<p>(b) to give into the hand of anyone, that is, the power;<p>(c) to give, that is, to turn the back;<p>(d) to give, that is, to yield fruit as a tree;<p>(e) to give, that is, to show compassion:<p>(f) to give honor, praise, etc.:<p>(g) to give into prison, or into custody.<p>2.

Rather, "His grave was appointed," or "they appointed Him His grave" [Hengstenberg]; that is, they intended (by crucifying Him with two thieves, Mt 27:38) that He should have His grave "with the wicked." Compare Joh 19:31, the denial of honorable burial being accounted a great ignominy (see on [854]Isa 14:19; Jer 26:23).<p>and with &#8230; rich&#8212;rather, "but He was with a rich man," &c. Gesenius, for the parallelism to "the wicked," translates "ungodly" (the effect of riches being to make one ungodly); but the Hebrew everywhere means "rich," never by itself ungodly; the parallelism, too, is one of contrast; namely, between their design and the fact, as it was ordered by God (Mt 27:57; Mr 15:43-46; Joh 19:39, 40); two rich men honored Him at His death, Joseph of Arimath&aelig;a, and Nicodemus.<p>in his death&#8212;Hebrew, "deaths." Lowth translates, "His tomb"; bamoth, from a different root, meaning "high places," and so mounds for sepulture (Eze 43:7). But all the versions oppose this, and the Hebrew hardly admits it. Rather translate, "after His death" [Hengstenberg]; as we say, "at His death." The plural, "deaths," intensifies the force; as Adam by sin "dying died" (Ge 2:17, Margin); that is, incurred death, physical and spiritual. So Messiah, His substitute, endured death in both senses; spiritual, during His temporary abandonment by the Father; physical, when He gave up the ghost.<p>because&#8212;rather, as the sense demands (so in Job 16:17), "although He had done no," &c. [Hengstenberg], (1Pe 2:20-22; 1Jo 3:5).<p>violence&#8212;that is, wrong.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/53.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He made his grave with the wicked; </span> and although he did not die for his own, but only for his people’s sins, yet he was willing to die like a malefactor, or like a sinner, as all other men are, and to be put into the grave, as they used to be; which was a further degree of his humiliation.

And it seems more reasonable, and more agreeable to the usage of the Holy Scripture, that this clause should design the same thing with the former, and that by rich he means the same persons whom he now called <span class="ital">wicked</span>, not as if all rich men were or must needs be wicked, but because for the most part they are so; upon which ground riches and rich men do commonly pass under an ill name in Scripture; of which see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-10.htm" title="For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yes, you shall diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.">Psalm 37:10</a> 49:6 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-24.htm" title="But woe to you that are rich! for you have received your consolation.">Luke 6:24</a> 18:24 <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-11.htm" title="For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it wither the grass, and the flower thereof falls, and the grace of the fashion of it perishes: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.">Jam 1:11</a> 5:1</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In his death, </span> Heb. in or at (or after, as this particle is frequently taken, as hath been already noted) <span class="ital">his deaths</span>; for Christ’s death might well be called deaths, in the plural number, because he underwent many kinds of death, and many deadly dangers and pains, which are frequently called by the name of death in Scripture, of which instances have been formerly given; and he might say, with no less truth than Paul did, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-31.htm" title="I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our LORD, I die daily.">1 Corinthians 15:31</a></span>, <span class="ital">I die daily</span>, and <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="Are they ministers of Christ?

But the last part of the foregoing clause cannot, without violence, be pulled asunder from the former, wherewith it is so closely joined, not only by a conjunction copulative, and, but also by being under the government of the same verb; and therefore this latter clause of the verse, if thus rendered, must be added as the reason of what is said to be done in the former. And so the sense of the place may be thus conceived, This was all the reward of the unspotted innocency of all his words and actions, to be thus ignominiously used.

These words are generally supposed to refer to a fact that was afterwards done; that Christ, who died with wicked men, as if he himself had been one, was buried in a rich man's grave. Could the words admit of the following transposition, they would exactly agree with it, "and he made his grave with the rich; and with the wicked in his death"; for he died between two thieves, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joseph of Arimathaea, a rich man. Or the meaning perhaps in general is, that, after his death, both rich men and wicked men were concerned in his sepulchre, and about his grave; two rich men, Nicodemus and Joseph, in taking down his body from the cross, in embalming it, and in laying it in the tomb of the latter; and wicked men, Roman soldiers, were employed in guarding the sepulchre, that his disciples might not take away the body. Or the sense is, "he" the people, the nation of the Jews, through whose enmity against him he suffered death, "gave", intended, and designed, that "his grave" should be with "the wicked"; and therefore accused him to the Roman governor, and got him condemned capitally, and condemned to a Roman death, crucifixion, that he might be buried where such sort of persons usually were; and then it may be supplied, "but he made it"; that is, God ordered and appointed, in his overruling providence, that it should be "with the rich in his death", as it was. Aben Ezra observes, that the word  which we translate "in his death", signifies a structure over a grave, "a sepulchral monument"; and then it may be rendered impersonally thus, "his grave was put or placed with the wicked, but his tomb", or sepulchral monument, was "with the rich"; his grave was indeed put under the care and custody of the wicked soldiers; yet a famous tomb being erected over it, at the expense of a rich man, Joseph of Arimathaea, which was designed for himself, made the burial of Christ honourable: which honour was done him, <p>because he had done no violence: or injury to any man's person or property; had not been guilty of rapine and oppression, theft and robbery; murder and cruelty; he had not been a stirrer up of sedition, an encourager of mobs, riots, and tumults, to the harm of the civil government: <p>neither was any deceit in his mouth: no false doctrine was delivered by him; he was no deceiver of the people, as he was charged; he did not attempt to seduce them from the true worship of God, or persuade them to believe anything contrary to the law of Moses, and the prophets; he was no enemy to church or state, nor indeed guilty of any manner of sin, nor given to any arts of trick and dissimulation; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>.

The unrelenting antipathy which the Servant experienced through life is continued even after his death, and expresses itself in the manner of his burial.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And they</span> (R.V.) <span class="ital">made his grave with the wicked</span>] The subject is indefinite, the construction being equivalent to a passive: “And his grave was made” &c. “With the wicked” need not imply that a special burial-ground was set apart for them as a class, but only that such persons were buried ignominiously and away from the family sepulchre, like Absalom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-17.htm" title="And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones on him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.">2 Samuel 18:17</a>). From <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-23.htm" title="And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him to Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.">Jeremiah 26:23</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-6.htm" title="And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof on the graves of the children of the people.">2 Kings 23:6</a>) it appears that it was a disgrace to be buried among the “common people.” In this case the “wicked” probably means the notoriously wicked, criminals, apostates, and such like. With these the Servant was numbered because his calamities had seemed to mark him out as a heinous sinner in the sight of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and with the rich in his death</span>] This clause must express the same idea as the preceding. To take the two antithetically: “they meant his grave to be with the wicked, but he was with the rich in his death” (Delitzsch) is utterly unwarrantable. It is, no doubt, somewhat difficult to justify this sense of “rich” as synonymous with “wicked” from O.T. usage, although it might perhaps be suggested by the common identification of poverty with piety. This explanation, however, is not quite satisfactory, and several emendations have been proposed, such as “the oppressor” (<span class="greekheb">עָשׁוֹקִ</span> for <span class="greekheb">עָשִׁיר</span>), “the defrauder” (<span class="greekheb">עָשִׁיק</span>, Aramaic), “evil-doers” (<span class="greekheb">עֹשֵׂי רַע</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in his death</span>] lit. “in his deaths.” The use of the plural is variously explained. Some find in it an intimation of the collective character of the subject spoken of under the name of the Servant; but even if the Servant be a collective idea, it is inconceivable that the writer should have here abandoned the personification which he has so strictly maintained throughout. Nor is it any relief to say that it means “in his state of death.” It is better to read the singular with the LXX. There is, however, another reading found in a few MSS. and adopted by many commentators, according to which the clause would form a perfect parallelism with the first line:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“And with the rich (or oppressor, &c.) <span class="ital">his sepulchral mound</span>.” But the word <span class="ital">bâmâh</span> (= high-place) is not elsewhere used in this sense.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">because he had done no violence &c</span>.] Render with R.V. <span class="bld">although</span> (“in spite of the fact that”) &c. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-17.htm" title="Not for any injustice in my hands: also my prayer is pure.">Job 16:17</a>. With this assertion of his innocence the narrative of the Servant’s career reaches its conclusion. While absolute sinlessness is not explicitly predicated of him, but only freedom from “violence” and “deceit,” yet the image of the lamb led to the slaughter, and his patient resignation to the will of God, strongly suggest that the prophet had in his mind the conception of a perfectly sinless character.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/53.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he made his grave with the wicked</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they assigned him his grave with the wicked.</span> The verb is used impersonally.

All these different features are predicates of the erat that is latent in non species ei neque decor and non adspectus. Nibhzeh is introduced again palindromically at the close in Isaiah's peculiar style; consequently Martini's conjecture &#1500;&#1488; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;  &#1504;&#1489;&#1494;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; is to be rejected. This nibhzeh (cf., ba&#770;zo&#772;h, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-7.htm">Isaiah 49:7</a>) is the keynote of the description which looks back in this plaintive tone. The predicate cha&#774;dal '&#305;&#772;sh&#305;&#772;m is misunderstood by nearly all the commentators, inasmuch as they take &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; as synonymous with &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, whereas it is rather used in the sense of &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (lords), as distinguished from bene&#772; 'a&#770;da&#770;m, or people generally (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-9.htm">Isaiah 2:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-17.htm">Isaiah 2:17</a>). The only other passages in which it occurs are <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-4.htm">Proverbs 8:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-4.htm">Psalm 141:4</a>; and in both instances it signifies persons of rank. Hence Cocceius explains it thus: "wanting in men, i.e., having no respectable men with Him, to support Him with their authority." It might also be understood as meaning the ending one among men, i.e., the one who takes the last place (S. &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, Jer. novissimus); but in this case He Himself would be described as &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, whereas it is absolutely affirmed that He had not the appearance or distinction of such an one. But the rendering deficiens (wanting) is quite correct; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/19-14.htm">Job 19:14</a>, "my kinsfolk have failed" (defecerunt, cha&#770;delu&#772;, cognati mei). The Arabic chadhalahu or chadhala &#8219;anhu (also points to the true meaning; and from this we have the derivatives cha&#770;dhil, refusing assistance, leaving without help; and machdhu&#770;l, helpless, forsaken (see Lane's Arabic Lexicon). In Hebrew, cha&#770;dal has not only the transitive meaning to discontinue or leave off a thing, but the intransitive, to case or be in want, so that cha&#774;dal '&#305;&#772;sh&#305;&#772;m may mean one in want of men of rank, i.e., finding no sympathy from such men. The chief men of His nation who towered above the multitude, the great men of this world, withdrew their hands from Him, drew back from Him: He had none of the men of any distinction at His side. Moreover, He was &#1502;&#1499;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, a man of sorrow of heart in all its forms, i.e., a man whose chief distinction was, that His life was one of constant painful endurance. And He was also &#1495;&#1500;&#1497; &#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, that is to say, not one known through His sickness (according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-13.htm">Deuteronomy 1:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-15.htm">Deuteronomy 1:15</a>), which is hardly sufficient to express the genitive construction; nor an acquaintance of disease (S. &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#837;, familiaris morbo), which would be expressed by &#1502;&#1497;&#1491;&#1468;&#1506; or &#1502;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;; but scitus morbi, i.e., one who was placed in a state to make the acquaintance of disease. The deponent passive &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, acquainted (like ba&#770;tua&#774;ch, confisus; za&#770;kbu&#772;r, mindful; peritus, pervaded, experienced), is supported by &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;  equals  &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;; Gr. &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;. The meaning is not, that He had by nature a sickly body, falling out of one disease into another; but that the wrath instigated by sin, and the zeal of self-sacrifice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-10.htm">Psalm 69:10</a>), burnt like the fire of a fever in His soul and body, so that even if He had not died a violent death, He would have succumbed to the force of the powers of destruction that were innate in humanity in consequence of sin, and of His own self-consuming conflict with them. Moreover, He was kemaste&#772;r pa&#770;n&#305;&#772;m mimmennu&#772;. This cannot mean, "like one hiding his face from us," as Hengstenberg supposes (with an allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a>); or, what is comparatively better, "like one causing the hiding of the face from him:" for although the feminine of the participle is written &#1502;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;, and in the plural &#1502;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; for &#1502;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is quite possible, we never meet with maste&#772;r for mast&#305;&#772;r, like haste&#772;r for hast&#305;&#772;r in the infinitive (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-15.htm">Isaiah 29:15</a>, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>). Hence maste&#772;r must be a noun (of the form marbe&#772;ts, marbe&#772;q, mashche&#772;th); and the words mean either "like the hiding of the face on our part," or like one who met with this from us, or (what is more natural) like the hiding of the face before his presence (according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-17.htm">Isaiah 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-8.htm">Isaiah 54:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>, and many other passages), i.e., like one whose repulsive face it is impossible to endure, so that men turn away their face or cover it with their dress (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-10.htm">Job 30:10</a>). And lastly, all the predicates are summed up in the expressive word nibhzeh: He was despised, and we did not think Him dear and worthy, but rather "esteemed Him not," or rather did not estimate Him at all, or as Luther expresses it, "estimated Him at nothing" (cha&#770;shabh, to reckon, value, esteem, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-8.htm">Isaiah 33:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>). <p>The second turn closes here. The preaching concerning His calling and His future was not believed; but the Man of sorrows was greatly despised among us. </body></html>
