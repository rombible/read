The refreshment <span class= "ital">after </span>travail, <span class= "ital">because </span>of the travail, was already present to the sufferer’s consciousness.<p><span class= "bld">By his knowledge . . .</span>—The phrase admits of two meanings, objective and subjective: (1) by their knowledge of Him; or (2) by His own knowledge; and each expresses a truth. Men are saved by knowing Christ. To know Him and the Father is eternal life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>). On the other hand, the Christ Himself makes His knowledge of the Father the ground of His power to impart that knowledge to men, and so to justify and save them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-25.htm" title="O righteous Father, the world has not known you: but I have known you, and these have known that you have sent me.">John 17:25</a>). Without that knowledge He could not have led them to know God as He knew. If we dare not say that the prophet distinctly contemplated both meanings, we may rejoice that he was guided to use a phrase which includes both. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm" title="And the spirit of the LORD shall rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;">Isaiah 11:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-7.htm" title="For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 2:7</a> are in favour of (2).<p><span class= "bld">For he shall bear.</span>—The conjunction is not necessarily more than <span class= "ital">and. </span>The importance of the renewal of the assurance given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-4.htm" title="Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.">Isaiah 53:4</a> lies in its declaring the perpetuity of the atoning work. The sacrifice of the Servant is “for ever” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-12.htm" title="But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;">Hebrews 10:12</a>). He “ever liveth to make intercession for us” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-25.htm" title="Why he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come to God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.">Hebrews 7:25</a>). He taketh away the sin of the world, through the æons of all duration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-29.htm" title="The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.">John 1:29</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/isaiah/53.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Isaiah<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE SUFFERING SERVANT-V<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-11.htm" title="He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.">Isaiah 53:11</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> These are all but the closing words of this great prophecy, and are the fitting crown of all that has gone before. We have been listening to the voice of a member of the race to whom the Servant of the Lord belonged, whether we limit that to the Jewish people or include in it all humanity. That voice has been confessing for the speaker and his brethren their common misapprehensions of the Servant, their blindness to the meaning of His sufferings and the mystery of His death. It has been proclaiming the true significance of these as now he had learned them, and has in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-10.htm" title="Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he has put him to grief: when you shall make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.">Isaiah 53:10</a> touched the mystery of the reward and triumph of the Servant.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> That note of His glory and coronation is caught up in the two closing verses, which, in substance, are the continuation of the idea of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-10.htm" title="Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he has put him to grief: when you shall make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.">Isaiah 53:10</a>. But this identity of substance makes the variety of form the more emphatic. Observe the ‘<span class="ital">My</span> Servant’ of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-11.htm" title="He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.">Isaiah 53:11</a>, and the ‘<span class="ital">I</span> will divide’ of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-12.htm" title="Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he has poured out his soul to death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.">Isaiah 53:12</a>. These oblige us to take this as the voice of God. The confession and belief of earth is hushed, that the recognition and the reward of the Servant may be declared from heaven. An added solemnity is thus given to the words, and the prophecy comes round again to the keynote on which it started in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-13.htm" title="Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.">Isaiah 52:13</a>, ‘<span class="ital">My</span> Servant.’ Notice, too, how the same characteristic is here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-10.htm" title="Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he has put him to grief: when you shall make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.">Isaiah 53:10</a> -that the recapitulation of the sufferings is almost equally prominent with the description of the reward. The two are so woven together that no power can part them. We may take these two verses as setting forth mainly two things-the divine promise that the Servant shall give righteousness to many, and the divine promise that the Servant shall conquer many for Himself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> As to the exposition, ‘of’ here is probably casual, not partitive, as the Authorised Version has it; ‘travail’ is not to be understood in the sense of childbirth, but of toil and suffering; ‘soul’ is equivalent to <span class="ital">life</span>. This fruit of His soul’s travail is further defined in the words which follow. The great result which will be beheld by Him and will fill and content His heart is that ‘by His knowledge He shall justify many.’ ‘By <span class="ital">His</span> knowledge’ certainly means, by the knowledge of Him on the part of others. The phrase might be taken either objectively or subjectively, but it seems to me that only the former yields an adequate sense. ‘My righteous servant’ is scarcely emphatic enough. The words in the original stand in an unusual order, which might be represented by ‘the righteous one, My servant,’ and is intended to put emphasis on the Servant’s righteousness, as well as to suggest the connection between His righteousness and His ‘justifying,’ in virtue of His being righteous. ‘Justify’ is an unusual form, and means to procure for, or impart righteousness to. ‘<span class="ital">The</span> many’ has stress on the article, and is the antithesis not to <span class="ital">all</span>, but to <span class="ital">few</span>. We might render it ‘the masses,’ an indefinite expression, which if not declaring universality, approaches very near to it, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-19.htm" title="For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.">Romans 5:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-28.htm" title="For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.">Matthew 26:28</a>. ‘He shall bear,’ a future referring to the Servant in a state of exaltation, and pointing to His continuous work after death. This bearing is the root of our righteousness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We may put the thoughts here in a definite order.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The great work which the Servant carries on.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>It consists in giving or imparting righteousness. It seems to me that it is out of place to be too narrow here in interpreting so as to draw distinctions between righteousness imparted and righteousness bestowed. We should rather take the general idea of <span class="ital">making righteous</span>, making, in fact, like Himself. Note that this is the work which is Christ’s characteristic one. All thoughts of His blessings to the world which omit that are imperfect.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The preparation for that making of us righteous.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The roots of our being made righteous by the righteous Servant are found in His bearing our sins. His sin-bearing work is basis of our righteousness. Christ justifies men by giving to them His own righteousness, and taking in turn their sins on Himself that He may expiate them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Not only ‘did He bear our sins in His own body on the tree,’ but He <span class="ital">will</span> bear them in His exaltation to the Throne, and only because He continuously and eternally does so are we justified on earth and shall we be sanctified in heaven.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The condition on which He imparts righteousness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>‘His knowledge,’ which is to be taken in the profound Biblical sense as including not only understanding but experience also.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Parallels are found in ‘This is life eternal to know Thee’ {<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>}, and in ‘That I may know Him’ {<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm" title="That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death;">Php 3:10</a>}. So this prophecy comes very near to the New Testament proclamation of righteousness by faith.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">IV. The grand sweep of the Servant’s work.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>‘The many’ is indefinite, and its very indefiniteness approximates it to universality. A shadowy vision of a great multitude that no man can number stretches out, as to the horizon, before the prophet. How many they are he knows not. He knows that they are numerous enough to ‘satisfy’ the Servant for all His sufferings. He knows, too, that there is no limit to the happy crowd except that which is set by the necessary condition of joining the bands of ‘the justified’-namely, ‘the knowledge of Him.’ They who receive the benefits which the Servant has died and will live to bring cannot be few; they may be all. If any are shut out, they are self-excluded.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">V. The Servant’s satisfaction.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>It may be that the word employed means ‘full,’ rather than ‘content,’ but the latter idea can scarcely be altogether absent from it. We have, then, the great hope that the Servant, gazing on the results of His sufferings, will be content, content to have borne them, content with what they have effected.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘The glory dies not and the grief is past.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And the ‘grief’ has had for fruit not only ‘glory’ gathering round the thorn-pierced head, but reflected glory shining on the brows of ‘the many,’ whom He has justified and sanctified by their experience of Him and His power. The creative week ended with the ‘rest’ of the Creator, not because His energy was tired and needed repose, but because He had fully carried out His purpose, and saw the perfected idea embodied in a creation that was ‘very good.’ The redemptive work ends with the Servant’s satisfied contemplation of the many whom He has made like Himself, His better creation.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/53.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>53:10-12 Come, and see how Christ loved us! We could not put him in our stead, but he put himself. Thus he took away the sin of the world, by taking it on himself. He made himself subject to death, which to us is the wages of sin. Observe the graces and glories of his state of exaltation. Christ will not commit the care of his family to any other. God's purposes shall take effect. And whatever is undertaken according to God's pleasure shall prosper. He shall see it accomplished in the conversion and salvation of sinners. There are many whom Christ justifies, even as many as he gave his life a ransom for. By faith we are justified; thus God is most glorified, free grace most advanced, self most abased, and our happiness secured. We must know him, and believe in him, as one that bore our sins, and saved us from sinking under the load, by taking it upon himself. Sin and Satan, death and hell, the world and the flesh, are the strong foes he has vanquished. What God designed for the Redeemer he shall certainly possess. When he led captivity captive, he received gifts for men, that he might give gifts to men. While we survey the sufferings of the Son of God, let us remember our long catalogue of transgressions, and consider him as suffering under the load of our guilt. Here is laid a firm foundation for the trembling sinner to rest his soul upon. We are the purchase of his blood, and the monuments of his grace; for this he continually pleads and prevails, destroying the works of the devil.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/53.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He shall see of the travail of his soul - This is the language of Yahweh, who is again introduced as speaking. The sense is, he shall see the fruit, or the result of his sufferings, and shall be satisfied. He shall see so much good resulting from his great sorrows; so much happiness, and so many saved, that the benefit shall be an ample compensation for all that he endured. The word rendered here 'travail' (&#1506;&#1502;&#1500;  &#8219;a&#770;ma&#770;l), denotes properly labor, toil; wearisome labor; labor and toil which produce exhaustion; and hence, sometimes vexation, sorrow, grief, trouble.

The word 'travail' with us has two senses, first, labor with pain, severe toil; and secondly, the pains of childbirth. The word is used here to denote excessive toil, labor, weariness; and refers to the arduous and wearisome labor and trial involved in the work of redemption, as that which exhausted the powers of the Messiah as a man, and sunk him down to the grave.<p>And shall be satisfied - That is, evidently, he shall be permitted to see so much fruit of his labors and sorrows as to be an ample recompence for all that he has done. It is not improbable that the image here is taken from a farmer who labors in preparing his soil for the seed, and who waits for the harvest; and who, when he sees the rich and yellow field of grain in autumn, or the wain heavily laden with sheaves, is abundantly satisfied for what he has done. He has pleasure in the contemplation of his labor, and of the result; and he does not regret the wearisome days and the deep anxiety with which he made preparation for the harvest. So with the Redeemer. There will be rich and most ample results for all that he has done. And when he shall look on the multitude that shall be saved; when he shall see the true religion spreading over the world; when he shall behold an immense host which no man can number gathered into heaven; and when he shall witness the glory that shall result to God from all that he has done, he shall see enough to be an ample compensation for all that he has endured, and he shall look on his work and its glorious results with pleasure.<p>We may remark here that this implies that great and most glorious results will come out of this work. The salvation of a large portion of the race, of multitudes which no man can number, will be necessary to be any suitable remuneration for the sufferings of the Son of God. We may be assured that he will be 'satisfied,' only when multitudes are saved; and it is, therefore, morally certain that a large portion of the race, taken as a whole, will enter into heaven. Hitherto the number has been small. The great mass have rejected him, and have been lost. But there are brighter times before the church and the world. The pure gospel of the Redeemer is yet to spread around the globe, and it is yet to become, and to be for ages, the religion of the world. Age after age is to roll on when all shall know him and obey him; and in those future times, what immense multitudes shall enter into heaven! So that it may yet be seen, that the number of those who will be lost from the whole human family, compared with those who will be saved, will be no greater in proportion than the criminals in a well-organized community who are imprisoned are, compared with the number of obedient, virtuous, and peaceful citizens.<p>By his knowledge - That is, by the knowledge of him. The idea is, by becoming fully acquainted with him and his plan of salvation. The word knowledge here is evidently used in a large sense to denote all that constitutes acquaintance with him. Thus Paul says <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>, 'That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection.' It is only by the knowledge of the Messiah; by an acquaintance with his character, doctrines, sufferings, death, and resurrection, that anyone can be justified. Thus the Saviour says <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>, 'And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.' People are to become acquainted with him; with his doctrines, and with his religion, or they can never be regarded and treated as righteous in the sight of a holy God.<p>Shall my righteous servant - On the meaning of the word 'servant,' as applied to the Messiah, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13</a>. The word 'righteous' (&#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511;  tsadiyq), Lowth supposes should be omitted. His reasons are:<p>1. That three manuscripts, two of them ancient, omit it.<p>2. That it makes a solecism in this place, for, according to the constant usage of the Hebrew language, the adjective, in a phrase of this kind, ought to follow the substantive; and,<p>3. That it makes the hemistich too long.<p>But none of these reasons are sufficient to justify a change in the text. The phrase literally is, 'the righteous, my servant;' and the sense is, evidently, 'my righteous servant.' The word righteous, applied to the Messiah, is designed to denote not only his personal holiness, but to have reference to the fact that he would' make many righteous (&#1497;&#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511;  yitseddiyq). It is applicable to him, because he was eminently holy and pure, and because also he was the source of righteousness to others; and in the work of justification it is important in the highest degree to fix the attention on the fact, that he by whom the sinner was to be justified was himself perfectly holy, and able to secure the justification and salvation of all who entrusted their souls to him. No man could feel secure of salvation unless he could commit his soul to one who was perfectly holy, and able to 'bring in everlasting righteousness.'<p>Justify - (&#1497;&#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511;  yatsediyq). The word &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;  tsa&#770;daq is of very frequent occurrence in the Bible; and no word is more important to a correct understanding of the plan of salvation than this, and the corresponding Greek word &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;  dikaio&#772;. On the meaning of the Greek word, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>. The Hebrew word means to be right, straight, as if spoken of a way <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-3.htm">Psalm 23:3</a>. Hence,<p>1.

"The travail of his soul" is the toil and labour he endured, in working out the salvation of his people; his obedience and death, his sorrows and sufferings; particularly those birth throes of his soul, under a sense of divine wrath, for the allusion is to women in travail; and all the agonies and pains of death which he went through. Now the fruit of all this he sees with inexpressible pleasure, and which gives him an infinite satisfaction; namely, the complete redemption of all the chosen ones, and the glory of the divine perfections displayed therein, as well as his own glory, which follows upon it; particularly this will be true of him as man and Mediator, when he shall have all his children with him in glory; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>. The words are by some rendered, "seeing himself or his soul freed from trouble, he shall be satisfied" (c); so he saw it, and found it, when he rose from the dead, and was justified in the Spirit; ascended to his God and Father, was set down at his right hand, and was made glad with his countenance, enjoying to the full eternal glory and happiness with him: and by others this, "after the travail (d) of his soul, he shall see a seed, and shall be satisfied"; as a woman, after her travail and sharp pains are over, having brought forth a son, looks upon it with joy and pleasure, and is satisfied, and forgets her former pain and anguish; so Christ, after all his sorrows and sufferings, sees a large number of souls regenerated, sanctified, justified, and brought to heaven, in consequence of them, which is a most pleasing and satisfactory sight unto him, <p>By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; Christ is the servant of the Lord; See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-3.htm">Isaiah 49:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13</a>. He is said to be "righteous", because of the holiness of his nature, and the righteousness of his life as a man; and because of his faithful discharge of his work and office as Mediator; and because he is the author and bringer in of an everlasting righteousness, by which he justifies his people; that is, acquits and absolves them, pronounces them righteous, and frees them from condemnation and death; he is the procuring and meritorious cause of their justification; his righteousness is the matter of it; in him, as their Head, are they justified, and by him the sentence is pronounced: for this is to be understood not of making men holy and righteous inherently, that is sanctification; nor of a teaching men doctrinally the way and method of justifying men, which is no other than ministers do; but it is a forensic act, a pronouncing and declaring men righteous, as opposed to condemnation: and they are many who are so justified; the many who were ordained to eternal life; the many whose sins Christ bore, and gave his life a ransom for; the many sons that are brought by him to glory. This shows that they are not a few, which serves to magnify the grace of God, exalt the satisfaction and righteousness of Christ, and encourage distressed sinners to look to him for justification of life; and yet they are not all men, for all men have not faith, nor are they saved; though all Christ's spiritual seed and offspring shall be justified, and shall glory: and this is "by" or "through his knowledge"; the knowledge of him, of Christ, which is no other than faith in him, by which a man sees and knows him, and believes in him, as the Lord his righteousness; and this agrees with the New Testament doctrine of justification by faith; which is no other than the manifestation, knowledge, sense, and perception of it by faith. <p>For he shall bear their iniquities; this is the reason of Christ's justifying many, the ground and foundation of it; he undertook to satisfy for their sins; these, as before observed, were laid on him; being laid on him, he bore them, the whole of them, and all the punishment due to them; whereby he made satisfaction for them, and bore them away, so as they are to be seen no more; and upon this justification proceeds. <p>(c)    "exemptum a molestia se ipsum (vel animam suam, Jun.); videns, satiabitur", Junius &amp; Tremellius.

An amplification of the meaning of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-10.htm" title="Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he has put him to grief: when you shall make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.">Isaiah 53:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">He shall see &c.</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">Of the travail of his soul he shall see, shall be satisfied</span>. It is doubtful if the preposition “of” can express <span class="ital">result</span>, as the E.V. suggests, or can introduce the object of the verb “he shall see.” It may be used in its local sense (“away from,” or “free from”) or causally (“in consequence of”), hardly in a temporal sense (“after”). The asyndetic construction of the two verbs probably indicates that one is to be subordinated to the other: <span class="bld">he shall see with satisfaction</span>, sc. the cause of Jehovah prospering in his hand (as <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-10.htm" title="Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he has put him to grief: when you shall make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.">Isaiah 53:10</a></span>). The LXX. deserves attention: “And it pleased the Lord to deliver (a variant reading of the last clause of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-10.htm" title="Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he has put him to grief: when you shall make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.">Isaiah 53:10</a></span>) (him) from the trouble of his soul: to cause him to see light” &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by his knowledge</span>] The gen. is not that of the obj. (“by the knowledge of him”) but of the subj.; the knowledge of God and salvation which he possesses, and which he communicates to others. The reference is to the prophetic activity of the Servant (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.">Isaiah 42:1</a> ff., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-2.htm" title="And he has made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand has he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver has he hid me;">Isaiah 49:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-4.htm" title="The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakens morning by morning, he wakens my ear to hear as the learned.">Isaiah 50:4</a> f.) which had seemed to be cut short by his death, but will be resumed and crowned with success in his exalted state.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall my righteous servant justify many</span>] Rather: <span class="bld">shall a righteous one, my servant, make the many righteous;</span> but the Hebr. is very peculiar. The ordinary sense of the word for “justify” (“declare righteous”) is here unsuitable, and the only other passage where it bears the ethical sense of “making righteous” is probably based on this verse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-3.htm" title="And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.">Daniel 12:3</a>, “they that turn the many to righteousness”). The <span class="ital">many</span> contains a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-14.htm" title="As many were astonished at you; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:">Isaiah 52:14</a> f. The clause would read more smoothly if we could suppose that the word rendered “a righteous one” has arisen through dittography; but the source of the difficulty probably lies deeper.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he shall bear their iniquities</span>] Cf. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-4.htm" title="Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.">Isaiah 53:4</a></span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/53.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied</span>; rather, <span class="accented">because of the travail of his soul he shall see</span>, <span class="accented">and be satisfied</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-11</a>, "He made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross, <span class="accented">Wherefore</span> God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is above every name: that at the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father"). No cross - no crown.

Nothing is so effectual in turning men to righteousness as teaching them the true knowledge of God  - his nature, his purposes with regard to them, his feelings towards them. Christ, from his own knowledge, gave men this knowledge, and so did all that could be done to draw them to his Father. And his efforts were not without result. The fruit of his teaching has been the justification of many - ay, of "the many," as both Isaiah and St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-19.htm">Romans 5:19</a>) testify. For he shall bear their iniquities; rather, <span class="accented">and their iniquities he himself shall bear.</span> The initial part of the clause is not "causal," but merely connective. There are two main things which Christ does for his people - he makes them righteous by infusing into them of his own righteousness; and he bears the burden of their iniquities, taking them upon himself, and by his perpetual intercession obtaining God's forgiveness of them. As Delitzsch says, "His continued taking of our trespasses upon himself is merely the constant presence and presentation of his atonement, which has been offered once for all. The dead yet living One, because of his one self-sacrifice, is an eternal Priest, who now lives to distribute the blessings which he has acquired" ('Commentary on Isaiah,' vol. 2:p. 338). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/53.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, as contrasted with &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, continues the true state of the case as contrasted with their false judgment. "Whereas He was pierced for our sins, bruised for our iniquities: the punishment was laid upon Him for our peace; and through His stripes we were healed." The question is, whether <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a> describes what He was during His life, or what He was in His death. The words decide in favour of the latter. For although cha&#770;la&#770;l is applied to a person mortally wounded but not yet dead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-52.htm">Jeremiah 51:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-27.htm">Psalm 69:27</a>), and cha&#770;lal to a heart wounded to death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-22.htm">Psalm 109:22</a>); the pure passives used here, which denote a calamity inflicted by violence from without, more especially mecho&#772;la&#770;l, which is not the participle polal of ch&#305;&#772;l (made to twist one's self with pain), but the participle poal of cha&#770;l (pierced, transfossus, the passive of mecho&#772;le&#772;l, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>), and the substantive clauses, which express a fact that has become complete in all its circumstances, can hardly be understood in any other way than as denoting, that "the servant of God" floated before the mind of the speaker in all the sufferings of death, just as was the case with Zechariah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>. There were no stronger expressions to be found in the language, to denote a violent and painful death. As min, with the passive, does not answer to the Greek &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;, but to &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;, the meaning is not that it was our sins and iniquities that had pierced Him through like swords, and crushed Him like heavy burdens, but that He was pierced and crushed on account of our sins and iniquities. It was not His own sins and iniquities, but ours, which He had taken upon Himself, that He might make atonement for them in our stead, that were the cause of His having to suffer so cruel and painful a death. <p>The ultimate cause is not mentioned; but &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; which follows points to it. His suffering was a mu&#772;sa&#770;r, which is an indirect affirmation that it was God who had inflicted it upon Him, for who else could the yo&#772;se&#772;r (meyasse&#772;r) be? We have rendered mu&#772;sa&#770;r "punishment;" and there was no other word in the language for this idea; for though &#1504;&#1511;&#1501; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; (to which Hofmann refers) have indeed the idea of punishment associated with them, the former signifies &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, the latter &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, whereas mu&#772;sa&#770;r not only denotes &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, as the chastisement of love (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11</a>), but also as the infliction of punishment ( equals  &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-22.htm">Proverbs 7:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-14.htm">Jeremiah 30:14</a>), just as David, when he prayed that God might not punish him in His anger and hot displeasure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-2.htm">Psalm 6:2</a>), could not find a more suitable expression for punishment, regarded as the execution of judgment, than &#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512; (&#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1495;). The word itself, which follows the form of mu&#772;sa&#770;d (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>), signifies primarily being chastised (from ya&#770;sar  equals  va&#770;sar, constringere, coercere), and included from the very outset the idea of practical chastisement, which then passed over into that of admonition in words, of warning by example, and of chastity as a moral quality. In the case before us, in which the reference is to a sufferer, and to a mu&#772;sa&#770;r resting upon him, this can only mean actual chastisement. If the expression had been &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, it would merely mean that God had caused Him, who had taken upon Himself our sins and iniquities and thus made Himself representatively or vicariously guilty, to endure the chastisement which those sins deserved. but it is &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;. The connection of the words is the same as that of &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-31.htm">Proverbs 15:31</a>. As the latter signifies "reproof leading to life," so the former signifies "the chastisement which leads to our peace." It is true that the suffix belongs to the one idea, that that has grown up through this combination of the words, like ber&#305;&#772;th shelo&#772;m&#305;&#772;, "my peace-covenant" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-10.htm">Isaiah 54:10</a>); but what else could our "peace-chastisement" be, than the chastisement that brings us peace, or puts us into a state of salvation? This is the idea involved in Stier's rendering, "restoring chastisement," and Hofmann's, "the chastisement wholesome for us." The difference in the exposition simply lies in the view entertained of the mu&#772;sa&#770;r, in which neither of these commentators will allow that there is any idea of a visitation of justice here. But according to our interpretation, the genitive &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;, which defines the mu&#772;sa&#770;r so far as its object and results are concerned, clearly shows that this manifestation of the justice of God, this satisfaction procured by His holiness, had His love for its foundation and end. It was our peace, or, what is more in accordance with the full idea of the word, our general well-being, our blessedness, which these sufferings arrived at and secured (the synonyms of sha&#770;lo&#772;m are to&#772;bh and yeshu&#772;&#8219;a&#770;h, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>). In what follows, "and by His stripes (cha&#774;bhu&#772;ra&#770;h  equals  chabbu&#772;ra&#770;h, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a>) we have been healed," sha&#770;lo&#772;m is defined as a condition of salvation brought about by healing. "Venustissimum &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;," exclaims Vitringa here. He means the same as Jerome when he says, suo vulnere vulnera nostra curavit. The stripes and weals that were inflicted upon Him have made us sound and well (the lxx keeps the collective singular, and renders it very aptly &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; &#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;; cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>). We were sick unto death because of our sins; but He, the sinless one, took upon Himself a suffering unto death, which was, as it were, the concentration and essence of the woes that we had deserved; and this voluntary endurance, this submission to the justice of the Holy One, in accordance with the counsels of divine love, became the source of our healing. </body></html>
