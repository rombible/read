The force of the contrast is emphasised, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-33.htm" title="And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab, and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting.">Jeremiah 48:33</a> (“a cheer which is no cheer,” Cheyne), by the use of the same word (<span class= "ital">hedad</span>) as that which in the next verse is employed for the song of those that tread the grapes. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-30.htm" title="Therefore prophesy you against them all these words, and say to them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar on his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.">Jeremiah 25:30</a>.)

More souls are ruined by pride than by any other sin whatever. Also, the very proud are commonly very passionate. With lies many seek to gain the gratification of pride and passion, but they shall not compass proud and angry projects. Moab was famous for fields and vineyards; but they shall be laid waste by the invading army. God can soon turn laughter into mourning, and joy into heaviness. In God let us always rejoice with holy triumph; in earthly things let us always rejoice with holy trembling. The prophet looks with concern on the desolations of such a pleasant country; it causes inward grief. The false gods of Moab are unable to help; and the God of Israel, the only true God, can and will make good what he has spoken. Let Moab know her ruin is very near, and prepare. The most awful declarations of Divine wrath, discover the way of escape to those who take warning. There is no escape, but by submission to the Son of David, and devoting ourselves to him. And, at length, when the appointed time comes, all the glory, prosperity, and multitude of the wicked shall perish.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore, I will bewail - So great is the desolation that I, the prophet, will lament it, though it belongs to another nation than mine own. The expression indicates that the calamity will be great (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a>).<p>With the weeping of Jazer - That is, I will pour out the same lamentation for the vine of Sibmah which I do for Jazer; implying that it would be deep and bitter sorrow (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-32.htm">Jeremiah 48:32</a>).<p>I will water thee with my tears - Indicating the grievous calamities that were coming upon those places, on account of the pride of the nation. They were to Isaiah foreign nations, but he had a heart that could feel for their calamities.<p>For the shouting for thy summer fruits - The shouting attending the ingathering of the harvest (note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a>). The word used here (&#1492;&#1497;&#1491;&#1491;  he&#772;yda&#770;d), denotes, properly, a joyful acclamation, a shout of joy or rejoicing, such as was manifested by the vintager and presser of grapes <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-30.htm">Jeremiah 25:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-33.htm">Jeremiah 48:33</a>; or such as was made by the warrior <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-14.htm">Jeremiah 51:14</a>. Here it means, that in the time when they would expect the usual shout of the harvest, it should not be heard, but instead, thereof, there should be the triumph of the warrior. Literally, 'upon thy summer fruits, and upon thy harvests has the shouting fallen;' that is, the shout of the warrior has fallen upon that harvest instead of the rejoicing of the farmer. So Jeremiah evidently understands it <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-32.htm">Jeremiah 48:32</a> : 'The spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits, and upon thy vintage.' Lowth proposes here a correction of the Hebrew text, but without necessity or authority. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

In the parallel passage (Jer 48:32) the words substantially express the same sense.

Or, as it is in the margin, <span class="ital">the shout or alarm is fallen upon thy summer fruits and thy harvest</span>, instead of that joyful shout which was then used, to which he here alludes; which seems to be the truer translation, not only because this Hebrew word is elsewhere used concerning <span class="ital">the shout</span> of an enemy falling upon a people, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-30.htm" title="Therefore prophesy you against them all these words, and say to them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar on his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.">Jeremiah 25:30</a> 51:14</span>, but especially by considering the parallel place, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-32.htm" title="O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for you with the weeping of Jazer: your plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen on your summer fruits and on your vintage.">Jeremiah 48:32</a></span>, where, <span class="ital">for the shout is fallen</span>, it is, <span class="ital">the spoiler is fallen upon</span>, &c. If it be objected, that the next verse speaks of the ceasing of their joyful shouts, and that this Hebrew word is there used for <span class="ital">vintage shouting</span>, which at first made me incline to the former interpretation, that seems to be fully answered from <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-33.htm" title="And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab, and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting.">Jeremiah 48:33</a></span>, which speaks likewise of the ceasing of their joy and joyful shouts, but withal adds, in the close of the verse, what may end this controversy, <span class="ital">their shouting shall be no shouting</span>; they shall indeed have a shouting, but not such a one as they used to have, a joyful shouting of their own people, but an insulting shout of their enemies. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah,.... That is, bewail the one, as he had done the other, both places with the fruits about them being destroyed by the enemy; or "therefore with weeping I will bewail" (most vehemently lament, an usual Hebraism) "Jazer", and "the vine of Sibmah": the prophet here represents the Moabites weeping for their vines more especially, they being a people addicted to drunkenness, in which their father was begotten; hence Bacchus is said to be the founder of many of their cities, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-32.htm">Jeremiah 48:32</a>.

"Give counsel, form a decision, make thy shadow like night in the midst of noon; hide the outcasts, do not betray the wanderers. Let mine outcasts tarry in thee, Moab; be a covert to it from before the spoiler." In their extremity they appeal to Zion for counsel, and the once proud but now thoroughly humbled Moabites place the decision of their fate in the hands of the men of Judah (so according to the Keri), and stand before Zion praying most earnestly for shelter and protection. Their fear of the enemy is so great, that in the light of the noon-day sun they desire to be covered with the protecting shade of Zion as with the blackness of night, that they may not be seen by the foe. The short-sentences correspond to the anxious urgency of the prayer (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-8.htm">Isaiah 33:8</a>). Pelila&#770;h (cf., peililyya&#770;h, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>) is the decision of a judge (pa&#770;lil); just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a> sheilshiyya&#770;h is the age and standing of three years. The figure of the shadow is the same as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2-3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>, etc.; no&#772;de&#772;d is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-14.htm">Isaiah 21:14</a>; nidda&#770;chai as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>; se&#772;ther as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>, and other passages; sho&#772;de&#772;d as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-1.htm">Isaiah 33:1</a>; mippene&#772; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-15.htm">Isaiah 21:15</a>. The whole is word for word Isaiah's. There is no necessity to read nidche&#772; instead of nidda&#770;c Mo'a&#770;b in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-4.htm">Isaiah 16:4</a>; still less is ay a collective termination, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-4.htm">Isaiah 20:4</a>. Nor are the words to be rendered "my outcasts ... of Moab," and the expression to be taken as a syntaxis ornata (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-6.htm">Isaiah 17:6</a>). On the contrary, such an expression is absolutely impossible here, where the speaker is alluding to himself. It is better to abide by the punctuation as we have it, with nidda&#770;chai (zakeph) closing the first clause of <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-4.htm">Isaiah 16:4</a>, and Moab (tebir, which is subordinate to the following tiphchah, and with this to athnach) opening the second as an absolute noun. This is the way in which we have rendered it above: "Moab ... be a shield to it ... " (though without taking la&#770;mo&#772; as equivalent to lo&#772;).<p>The question then arises, By what means has Zion awakened such reverence and confidence on the part of Moab? This question is answered in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-4.htm">Isaiah 16:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-5.htm">Isaiah 16:5</a> : "For the extortioner is at an end, desolation has disappeared, treaders down are away from the land. And a throne is established by grace, and there sits thereon in truth in the tent of David one judging, and zealous for right, and practised in righteousness." The imperial world-power, which pressed out both marrow and blood (me&#772;tz, a noun of the same form as le&#772;tz, like m&#305;&#772;tz in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-33.htm">Proverbs 30:33</a>, pressure), and devastated and trod down everything (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-20.htm">Isaiah 29:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-1.htm">Isaiah 33:1</a>, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8</a>), is swept away from the land on this side of the Jordan; Jerusalem is not subject to it now, but has come forth more gloriously out of all her oppressions than ever she did before. And the throne of the kingdom of Judah has not fallen down, but by the manifestation of Jehovah's grace has been newly established. There no longer sits thereon a king who dishonours Him, and endangers His kingdom; but the tent-roof of the fallen and now re-erected hut of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>) is spread over a King in whom the truth of the promise of Jehovah is verified, inasmuch as justice and righteousness are realized through all that He does. The Messianic times must therefore have dawned (so the Targum understands it), since grace and truth (chesed ve'emeth) and "justice and righteousness" (mishpa&#770;t u&#772;tzeda&#770;ka&#770;h) are the divino-human signs of those times, and as it were their kindred genii; and who can here fail to recall to mind the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a> (cf., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-5.htm">Isaiah 33:5-6</a>)? The king depicted here is the same as "the lion out of Judah," threatened against Moab in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-9.htm">Isaiah 15:9</a>. Only by thus submitting to Him and imploring His grace will it escape the judgment. </body></html>
