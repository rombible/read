More souls are ruined by pride than by any other sin whatever. Also, the very proud are commonly very passionate. With lies many seek to gain the gratification of pride and passion, but they shall not compass proud and angry projects. Moab was famous for fields and vineyards; but they shall be laid waste by the invading army. God can soon turn laughter into mourning, and joy into heaviness. In God let us always rejoice with holy triumph; in earthly things let us always rejoice with holy trembling. The prophet looks with concern on the desolations of such a pleasant country; it causes inward grief. The false gods of Moab are unable to help; and the God of Israel, the only true God, can and will make good what he has spoken. Let Moab know her ruin is very near, and prepare. The most awful declarations of Divine wrath, discover the way of escape to those who take warning. There is no escape, but by submission to the Son of David, and devoting ourselves to him. And, at length, when the appointed time comes, all the glory, prosperity, and multitude of the wicked shall perish.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And gladness ... - The gladness and joy that was commonly felt in the field producing a rich and luxuriant harvest.<p>Out of the plentiful field - Hebrew, 'From Carmel;' but Carmel means a fruitful field as well as the mountain of that name (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-18.htm">Isaiah 10:18</a>).<p>I have made their vintage shouting to cease - That is, by the desolation that has come upon the land.

The word <span class="accented">carmel</span> seems to designate "garden," or "orchard ground" generally, without reference to the degree of fertility.

Those who have heard the vintage-songs in the north of Italy and elsewhere will appreciate the sadness of this silence. <span class="cmt_word">The treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses</span>. Wine-presses were in or near the vineyards. They consisted of two vats, or two reservoirs cut in the rock, one above the other, with a passage of communication between them. The grapes were placed in the upper vat or reservoir, and were crushed by the naked feet of the vintagers. Sometimes as many as seven persons "trod the wine-press" together (Wilkinson, 'Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 1. p. 45). It was usual for them to sing as they trod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-30.htm">Jeremiah 25:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-33.htm">Jeremiah 48:33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I have made their vintage shouting to cease.</span> The prophet is the mouthpiece of God. Accidentally, as it were, he here betrays the personality which is behind him. It is not he, but God, who has caused the invasion which has reduced the vintagers to silence. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There they show themselves, on the spot to which their land once reached before it passed into the possession of Israel - there, on its farthest boundary in the direction towards Judah, which was seated above; and taking heart, address the following petitions to Zion, or to the Davidic court, on the other side. "Give counsel, form a decision, make thy shadow like night in the midst of noon; hide the outcasts, do not betray the wanderers. Let mine outcasts tarry in thee, Moab; be a covert to it from before the spoiler." In their extremity they appeal to Zion for counsel, and the once proud but now thoroughly humbled Moabites place the decision of their fate in the hands of the men of Judah (so according to the Keri), and stand before Zion praying most earnestly for shelter and protection. Their fear of the enemy is so great, that in the light of the noon-day sun they desire to be covered with the protecting shade of Zion as with the blackness of night, that they may not be seen by the foe. The short-sentences correspond to the anxious urgency of the prayer (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-8.htm">Isaiah 33:8</a>). Pelila&#770;h (cf., peililyya&#770;h, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>) is the decision of a judge (pa&#770;lil); just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a> sheilshiyya&#770;h is the age and standing of three years. The figure of the shadow is the same as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2-3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>, etc.; no&#772;de&#772;d is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-14.htm">Isaiah 21:14</a>; nidda&#770;chai as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>; se&#772;ther as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>, and other passages; sho&#772;de&#772;d as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-1.htm">Isaiah 33:1</a>; mippene&#772; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-15.htm">Isaiah 21:15</a>. The whole is word for word Isaiah's. There is no necessity to read nidche&#772; instead of nidda&#770;c Mo'a&#770;b in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-4.htm">Isaiah 16:4</a>; still less is ay a collective termination, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-4.htm">Isaiah 20:4</a>. Nor are the words to be rendered "my outcasts ... of Moab," and the expression to be taken as a syntaxis ornata (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-6.htm">Isaiah 17:6</a>). On the contrary, such an expression is absolutely impossible here, where the speaker is alluding to himself. It is better to abide by the punctuation as we have it, with nidda&#770;chai (zakeph) closing the first clause of <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-4.htm">Isaiah 16:4</a>, and Moab (tebir, which is subordinate to the following tiphchah, and with this to athnach) opening the second as an absolute noun. This is the way in which we have rendered it above: "Moab ... be a shield to it ... " (though without taking la&#770;mo&#772; as equivalent to lo&#772;).<p>The question then arises, By what means has Zion awakened such reverence and confidence on the part of Moab? This question is answered in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-4.htm">Isaiah 16:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-5.htm">Isaiah 16:5</a> : "For the extortioner is at an end, desolation has disappeared, treaders down are away from the land. And a throne is established by grace, and there sits thereon in truth in the tent of David one judging, and zealous for right, and practised in righteousness." The imperial world-power, which pressed out both marrow and blood (me&#772;tz, a noun of the same form as le&#772;tz, like m&#305;&#772;tz in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-33.htm">Proverbs 30:33</a>, pressure), and devastated and trod down everything (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-20.htm">Isaiah 29:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-1.htm">Isaiah 33:1</a>, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8</a>), is swept away from the land on this side of the Jordan; Jerusalem is not subject to it now, but has come forth more gloriously out of all her oppressions than ever she did before. And the throne of the kingdom of Judah has not fallen down, but by the manifestation of Jehovah's grace has been newly established. There no longer sits thereon a king who dishonours Him, and endangers His kingdom; but the tent-roof of the fallen and now re-erected hut of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>) is spread over a King in whom the truth of the promise of Jehovah is verified, inasmuch as justice and righteousness are realized through all that He does. The Messianic times must therefore have dawned (so the Targum understands it), since grace and truth (chesed ve'emeth) and "justice and righteousness" (mishpa&#770;t u&#772;tzeda&#770;ka&#770;h) are the divino-human signs of those times, and as it were their kindred genii; and who can here fail to recall to mind the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a> (cf., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-5.htm">Isaiah 33:5-6</a>)? The king depicted here is the same as "the lion out of Judah," threatened against Moab in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-9.htm">Isaiah 15:9</a>. Only by thus submitting to Him and imploring His grace will it escape the judgment. </body></html>
