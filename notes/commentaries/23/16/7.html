More souls are ruined by pride than by any other sin whatever. Also, the very proud are commonly very passionate. With lies many seek to gain the gratification of pride and passion, but they shall not compass proud and angry projects. Moab was famous for fields and vineyards; but they shall be laid waste by the invading army. God can soon turn laughter into mourning, and joy into heaviness. In God let us always rejoice with holy triumph; in earthly things let us always rejoice with holy trembling. The prophet looks with concern on the desolations of such a pleasant country; it causes inward grief. The false gods of Moab are unable to help; and the God of Israel, the only true God, can and will make good what he has spoken. Let Moab know her ruin is very near, and prepare. The most awful declarations of Divine wrath, discover the way of escape to those who take warning. There is no escape, but by submission to the Son of David, and devoting ourselves to him. And, at length, when the appointed time comes, all the glory, prosperity, and multitude of the wicked shall perish.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab - One part of the nation shall mourn for another; they shall howl, or lament, in alternate responses. Jerome renders it, 'the people (shall howl) to the city; the city to the provinces.' The general idea is, that there would be an universal lamentation throughout the land. This would be the punishment which would result from their pride in neglecting to send the tribute and seeking the favor of the Jews; or they would lament because the expectation of finding a refuge among the Israelites was taken away.<p>For the foundations - On account of the foundations of Kir-hareseth, for they shall be overthrown; that is, that city shall be destroyed. The word rendered here 'foundations' (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;  'a&#774;sh&#305;&#770;yshe&#772;y), occurs nowhere else but in this place, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>. The Septuagint renders it: 'The inhabitants.' The Chaldee, 'Men.' Jeremiah, in the parallel place, renders it also 'men' <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-31.htm">Jeremiah 48:31</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>, it is rendered 'flagons of wine' - and it has been supposed by many that it has this sense here, as this would agree with what is immediately added of the fields of Heshbon, and the vine of Sibmah. Rosenmuller renders it by 'strong people, or heroes;' and supposes that it means that the "strong" people of Kir-hareseth would be destroyed, and that they would mourn on that account. The probable sense is, that that on which the city rested, or was based, was to be destroyed. So Kimchi, Jarchi, and the Syriac understand it.<p>Kir-ha-reseth - literally, "wall of potsherds, or of bricks." Aquila renders it, &#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#837;  Toicho&#772; ostrakino&#772;.

This was a city of Moab, but where it was situated is unknown. Vitringa supposes that it was the same as Kir Moab <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>, which, Gesenius says, is not improbable, for it is now mentioned as in ruins, and as one of the chief cities. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

One Moabite shall mourn for another; the living for the dead; or one part of the country for another; or to Moab, they shall howl in turns, answering to one another: <p>everyone shall howl: every Moabite, or the whole country of Moab shall howl, being everywhere desolate: <p>for the foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn: surely they are stricken; this was a very principal city in the land of Moab, and a very strong one, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-25.htm">2 Kings 3:25</a>. It signifies, according to some, "the city of the sun", so called, it may be, because the sun was worshipped here; or, according to others, "the earthen city", or "city of brick", because its houses and walls were made of brick; and so the Vulgate Latin version renders it, "the walls of burnt brick". Now this strong city was to be razed even to the foundations, so that these would be discovered, which would occasion mourning to its inhabitants, and those of other places. Kimchi interprets "the foundations", of the great men and princes of Moab, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-31.htm">Jeremiah 48:31</a> so the Targum, <p>"and they shall howl over the men of the city of their strength;'' <p>R. Jonah, of the men of the army, the foundation of the kingdom; so Ben Melech. The word translated "foundations" signifies also flagons or bottles, and so Aben Ezra and Abendana understand it here; and accordingly the words may be thus rendered, "for the bottles of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn, verily they are broken" (d); this agrees with the signification of the word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1</a> and with what follows, concerning the vine of Sibmah; the reason of the mourning seems to be, that there would be no wine, and the bottles would lie useless, and be broken. <p>(d) "de lagenis Kir-hareseth gemetis, ubique confractae sunt", De Dieu; "propter dolia Cir-hareseth gemetis"; so some in Vatablus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore shall Moab wail for Moab, every one shall wail: for the foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn; surely <i>they are</i> <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> stricken.</span><p>(g) For all your mourning, yet the city will be destroyed even to the foundation.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">the foundations</span>] R.V. renders rightly <span class="bld">raisin-cakes</span>. These cakes of compressed grapes are mentioned less as an article of commerce than as a delicacy used at religious feasts (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-1.htm" title="Then said the LORD to me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine.">Hosea 3:1</a>, R.V.). The word never means “foundations.” The parallel passage in Jeremiah substitutes the tamer “men.” <span class="ital">Kir-hareseth</span> is the same as Kir-heres (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-11.htm" title="Why my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kirharesh.">Isaiah 16:11</a></span>) and perhaps identical with Kir of Moab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm" title="The burden of Moab.

(Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/48-31.htm" title="Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; my heart shall mourn for the men of Kirheres....">Jeremiah 48:31-32</a>.)

Herod., 8:99; 9:24). <span class="cmt_word">For the foundations of Kir-Hareseth shall ye mourn</span>. The word here translated "foundations" is elsewhere always rendered "flagons" or "flagons of wine" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-19.htm">2 Samuel 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-5.htm">Song of Solomon 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>). And this rendering is more agreeable to the context than "foundations," since it is the loss of the products of the soil which is threatened in the next three verses. "Kir-Hareseth" is probably the same place as the "Kir-Moab" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>. It was one of the principal cities of Moab (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-25.htm">2 Kings 2:25</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But just because this lion is Judah and its government, the summons goes forth to the Moabites, who have fled to Edom, and even to Sela, i.e., Petra (Wady Musa), near Mount Hor in Arabia Petraea, to which it gave its name, to turn for protection to Jerusalem. "Send a land-ruler's tribute of lambs from Sela desert-wards to the mountain of the daughter of Zion." This v. is like a long-drawn trumpet-blast. The prophecy against Moab takes the same turn here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-32.htm">Isaiah 14:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-7.htm">Isaiah 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-16.htm">Isaiah 19:16</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-18.htm">Isaiah 23:18</a>. The judgment first of all produces slavish fear; and this is afterwards refined into loving attachment. Submission to the house of David is Moab's only deliverance. This is what the prophet, weeping with those that weep, calls out to them in such long-drawn, vehement, and urgent tones, even into the farthest hiding-place in which they have concealed themselves, viz., the rocky city of the Edomites. The tribute of lambs which was due to the ruling prince is called briefly car mo&#772;she&#772;l-'eretz. This tribute, which the holders of the pasture-land so rich in flocks have hitherto sent to Samaria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4</a>), they are now to send to Jerusalem, the "mountain of the daughter of Zion" (as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-32.htm">Isaiah 10:32</a>, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-7.htm">Isaiah 18:7</a>), the way to which lay through "the desert," i.e., first of all in a diagonal direction through the Arabah, which stretched downwards to Aelath. </body></html>
