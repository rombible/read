Which very probably happened to Belshazzar, who, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-30.htm" title="In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.">Daniel 5:30</a>, was slain in the night in which the city was taken by Cyrus, when his people had neither opportunity nor heart to bestow an honourable interment upon him, and the conquerors would not suffer them to do it. <span class="ital">Like an abominable branch </span>— Like a rotten twig of a tree, which he that prunes the trees, casts away: <span class="ital">and as raiment of those that are slain</span> — Which, being mangled, and besmeared with mire and blood, is cast away with contempt. <span class="ital">That go down to the pit </span>— Who, being slain, are cast into some pit.

And this might literally happen to Belshazzar’s dead body. <span class="ital">Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial </span>— Not buried, as they are. <span class="ital">Because thou hast slain thy people </span>— Thou hast exercised great tyranny and cruelty, not only to thine enemies, but even to thine own subjects. <span class="ital">The seed of evil-doers </span>— Such as Belshazzar was, being descended from that Nebuchadnezzar who had made such horrid slaughters and devastations in the world, merely to gratify his own insatiable lusts, and who had been so impious toward God and his temple, and so bloody toward his church and people; <span class="ital">shall never be renowned </span>— Or, <span class="ital">shall not be renowned for ever: </span>although I have long borne with thee and thy family.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-23 The whole plan of Divine Providence is arranged with a view to the good of the people of God. A settlement in the land of promise is of God's mercy. Let the church receive those whom God receives. God's people, wherever their lot is cast, should endeavour to recommend religion by a right and winning conversation. Those that would not be reconciled to them, should be humbled by them. This may be applied to the success of the gospel, when those were brought to obey it who had opposed it. God himself undertakes to work a blessed change. They shall have rest from their sorrow and fear, the sense of their present burdens, and the dread of worse. Babylon abounded in riches. The king of Babylon having the absolute command of so much wealth, by the help of it ruled the nations. This refers especially to the people of the Jews; and it filled up the measure of the king of Babylon's sins. Tyrants sacrifice their true interest to their lusts and passions. It is gracious ambition to covet to be like the Most Holy, for he has said, Be ye holy, for I am holy; but it is sinful ambition to aim to be like the Most High, for he has said, He who exalts himself shall be abased. The devil thus drew our first parents to sin. Utter ruin should be brought upon him. Those that will not cease to sin, God will make to cease. He should be slain, and go down to the grave; this is the common fate of tyrants. True glory, that is, true grace, will go up with the soul to heaven, but vain pomp will go down with the body to the grave; there is an end of it. To be denied burial, if for righteousness' sake, may be rejoiced in, Mt 5:12. But if the just punishment of sin, it denotes that impenitent sinners shall rise to everlasting shame and contempt. Many triumphs should be in his fall. God will reckon with those that disturb the peace of mankind. The receiving the king of Babylon into the regions of the dead, shows there is a world of spirits, to which the souls of men remove at death. And that souls have converse with each other, though we have none with them; and that death and hell will be death and hell indeed, to all who fall unholy, from the height of this world's pomps, and the fulness of its pleasures. Learn from all this, that the seed of evil-doers shall never be renowned. The royal city is to be ruined and forsaken. Thus the utter destruction of the New Testament Babylon is illustrated, Re 18:2. When a people will not be made clean with the besom of reformation, what can they expect but to be swept off the face of the earth with the besom of destruction?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All the kings of the nations - That is, this is the common way in which the kings are buried.<p>Lie in glory - They lie in a magnificent mausoleum; they are surrounded with splendor even in their tombs. It is well known that vast sums of money were expended to rear magnificent mausoleums as the burial place of kings. With this design, probably, the pyramids of Egypt were reared; and the temple of Bel in Babylon, we are told, was employed for this purpose. Josephus says that vast quantities of money were buried in the sepulchre of David. The kings of Israel were buried in a royal burying place on Mount Zion <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-20.htm">2 Chronicles 21:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-24.htm">2 Chronicles 35:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-16.htm">Nehemiah 3:16</a>.

Of other nations, besides those he governed, and even of those whom he had subdued, at least their ancestors, the greatest part of them however; for the word "all" does not always signify every individual, though by the repetition of it, it here bids fair for such a sense, there being but very few, or scarce any exceptions to this observation; for, on some account or another, both good and bad kings are interred in great state: <p>even all of them lie in glory; in rich tombs and stately monuments, erected for the honour of them; and where they "sleep", as the word signifies, with their fathers, their ancestors, and are at rest, in the state of the dead, where they will continue to the resurrection: <p>everyone in his own house; or grave, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-23.htm">Job 30:23</a> the same with his long home, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a> or the house of his world: in reference to which, the Targum paraphrases it by the same phrase here; and though their graves were not in their dwelling houses or palaces, yet often near them, and in their own country, and were what had been erected, or caused to be erected by them, in their lifetime. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">every one in his own house</span>] This yields a perfectly good sense as it stands, the “house” being the tomb prepared by the king in his lifetime.

The care taken to prepare tombs was not confined to Egypt, though there obtaining its greatest development. Among others, the Persian kings certainly prepared their own sepulchers; and probably the practice was general. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"How art thou fallen from the sky, thou star of light, sun of the dawn, hurled down to the earth, thou that didst throw down nations from above?" &#1492;&#1497;&#1500;&#1500; is here the morning star (from ha&#770;lal, to shine, resolved from hillel, after the form &#1502;&#1488;&#1503;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-10.htm">Jeremiah 13:10</a>, &#1505;&#1506;&#1507;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-113.htm">Psalm 119:113</a>, or rather attaching itself as a third class to the forms &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;, &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1501;: compare the Arabic sairaf, exchanger; saikal, sword-cleaner). It derives its name in other ancient languages also from its striking brilliancy, and is here called ben-shachar (sun of the dawn), just as in the classical mythology it is called son of Eos, from the fact that it rises before the sun, and swims in the morning light as if that were the source of its birth.<p>(Note: It is singular, however, that among the Semitic nations the morning star is not personified as a male (Heo&#772;sphoros or Pho&#772;sphoros), but as a female (Astarte, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-8.htm">Isaiah 17:8</a>), and that it is called Na&#770;gha&#770;h, Ashtoreth, Zuhara, but never by a name derived from ha&#770;lal; whilst the moon is regarded as a male deity (Sin), and in Arabic hila&#770;l signifies the new moon, which might be called ben- shacar (son of the dawn), from the fact that, from the time when it passes out of the invisibility of its first phase, it is seen at sunrise, and is as it were born out of the dawn.)<p>Lucifer, as a name given to the devil, was derived from this passage, which the fathers (and lately Stier) interpreted, without any warrant whatever, as relating to the apostasy and punishment of the angelic leaders. The appellation is a perfectly appropriate one for the king of Babel, on account of the early date of the Babylonian culture, which reached back as far as the grey twilight of primeval times, and also because of its predominant astrological character. The additional epithet cho&#772;le&#772;sh &#8219;al-go&#772;yim is founded upon the idea of the influxus siderum:<p>(Note: In a similar manner, the sun-god (San) is called the "conqueror of the king's enemies," "breaker of opposition," etc., on the early Babylonian monuments (see G. Rawlinson, The Five Great Monarchies, i.160).)<p>cholesh signifies "overthrowing" or laying down (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-13.htm">Exodus 17:13</a>), and with &#8219;al, "bringing defeat upon;" whilst the Talmud (b. Sabbath 149b) uses it in the sense of projiciens sortem, and thus throws light upon the cholesh ( equals  purah, lot) of the Mishnah. A retrospective glance is now cast at the self-deification of the king of Babylon, in which he was the antitype of the devil and the type of antichrist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-36.htm">Daniel 11:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>), and which had met with its reward. </body></html>
