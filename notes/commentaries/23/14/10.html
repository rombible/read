The king of Babylon, the report of whose coming had roused awe and wonder, is found to be as weak as any of the other Rephaim, the <span class= "ital">eidôla, </span>or shadowy forms, of Homer (<span class= "ital">Il, xxiii.</span>, 72). With these words the vision of the spectral world ends, and the next verse takes up the taunting song of the liberated Israelites, the language of which is, however, influenced by the imagery of the vision.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-23 The whole plan of Divine Providence is arranged with a view to the good of the people of God. A settlement in the land of promise is of God's mercy. Let the church receive those whom God receives. God's people, wherever their lot is cast, should endeavour to recommend religion by a right and winning conversation. Those that would not be reconciled to them, should be humbled by them. This may be applied to the success of the gospel, when those were brought to obey it who had opposed it. God himself undertakes to work a blessed change. They shall have rest from their sorrow and fear, the sense of their present burdens, and the dread of worse. Babylon abounded in riches. The king of Babylon having the absolute command of so much wealth, by the help of it ruled the nations. This refers especially to the people of the Jews; and it filled up the measure of the king of Babylon's sins. Tyrants sacrifice their true interest to their lusts and passions. It is gracious ambition to covet to be like the Most Holy, for he has said, Be ye holy, for I am holy; but it is sinful ambition to aim to be like the Most High, for he has said, He who exalts himself shall be abased. The devil thus drew our first parents to sin. Utter ruin should be brought upon him. Those that will not cease to sin, God will make to cease. He should be slain, and go down to the grave; this is the common fate of tyrants. True glory, that is, true grace, will go up with the soul to heaven, but vain pomp will go down with the body to the grave; there is an end of it. To be denied burial, if for righteousness' sake, may be rejoiced in, Mt 5:12. But if the just punishment of sin, it denotes that impenitent sinners shall rise to everlasting shame and contempt. Many triumphs should be in his fall. God will reckon with those that disturb the peace of mankind. The receiving the king of Babylon into the regions of the dead, shows there is a world of spirits, to which the souls of men remove at death. And that souls have converse with each other, though we have none with them; and that death and hell will be death and hell indeed, to all who fall unholy, from the height of this world's pomps, and the fulness of its pleasures. Learn from all this, that the seed of evil-doers shall never be renowned. The royal city is to be ruined and forsaken. Thus the utter destruction of the New Testament Babylon is illustrated, Re 18:2. When a people will not be made clean with the besom of reformation, what can they expect but to be swept off the face of the earth with the besom of destruction?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All they shall speak ... - Language of astonishment that one so proud, and who apparently never expected to die, should be brought down to that humiliating condition.

So they would say, could they speak, and are here represented as if they did: <p>art thou become also weak as we? who had been more powerful than they, had been too many for them, and had subdued them, and ruled over them, and was not only looked upon as invincible but as immortal, yea, as a deity; and yet now was become "sick", as the word (b) signifies, or by sickness brought to death, and by death enfeebled and rendered weak and without strength, stripped of all natural strength, as well as of all civil power and authority: <p>art thou become like unto us? who thought himself, and was flattered by others, that there were none like unto him; but now as the rest of the dead, and upon a level with them. So will it be with the Romish antichrist, who now exalts himself above all that is called God, and reigns over the kings of the earth, and shows himself as if he was God, and of whom his parasites say, "who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?" when he shall be consumed by Christ, and cast into the lake of fire with the devil and false prophet, he will be like the kings of the earth deceived by him, and the rest of the worshippers of him, and be as weak as they, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>. <p>(b) a "aegrotuss fuit". <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Art thou also become weak as</span> <span class="cmt_word">we</span>? rather, <span class="accented">So thou also art made weak as we!</span> (On the supposed weakness of the dead, see the comment on ver. 9.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The song of the redeemed is a song concerning the fall of the king of Babel. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-3.htm">Isaiah 14:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4</a>. Instead of the hiphil hinniach (to let down) of <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-1.htm">Isaiah 14:1</a>, we have here, as in the original passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-19.htm">Deuteronomy 25:19</a>, the form he&#772;niach, which is commonly used in the sense of quieting, or procuring rest. &#1506;&#1510;&#1489; is trouble which plagues (as &#1506;&#1502;&#1500; is trouble which oppresses), and ro&#772;gez restlessness which wears out with anxious care (<a href="http://biblehub.com/job/3-26.htm">Job 3:26</a>, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-18.htm">Ezekiel 12:18</a>). The assimilated min before the two words is pronounced mi&#774;, with a weak reduplication, instead of me&#772;, as elsewhere, before &#1495;, &#1492;, and even before &#1512;    (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-28.htm">1 Samuel 23:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-16.htm">2 Samuel 18:16</a>). In the relative clause &#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1470;&#1489;&#1498; &#1488;&#1513;&#1512;, &#1488;&#1513;&#1512; is not the Hebrew casus adverb. answering to the Latin ablative qu servo te usi sunt; not do &#1489;&#1498; ... &#1488;&#1513;&#1512; belong to one another in the sense of quo, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-3.htm">Deuteronomy 21:3</a>, qu (vitul); but it is regarded as an acc. obj. according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-14.htm">Exodus 1:14</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39</a>, qu'on t'a fait servir, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-5.htm">Numbers 32:5</a>, qu'on donne la terre (Luzzatto). When delivered from such a yoke of bondage, Israel would raise a ma&#770;sha&#770;l. According to its primary and general meaning, ma&#770;sha&#770;l signifies figurative language, and hence poetry generally, more especially that kind of proverbial poetry which loves the emblematical, and, in fact, any artistic composition that is piquant in its character; so that the idea of what is satirical or defiant may easily be associated with it, as in the passage before us.<p>The words are addressed to the Israel of the future in the Israel of the present, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-1.htm">Isaiah 12:1</a>. The former would then sing, and say as follows. "How hath the oppressor ceased! The place of torture ceased! Jehovah hath broken the rod of the wicked, the ruler's staff, which cmote nations in wrath with strokes without ceasing subjugated nations wrathfully with hunting than nevers stays." Not one of the early translators ever thought of deriving the hap. leg. madheba&#770;h from the Aramaean dehab (gold), as Vitringa, Aurivillius, and Rosenmller have done. The former have all translated the word as if it were marhe&#772;ba&#770;h (haughty, violent treatment), as corrected by J. D. Michaelis, Doederlein, Knobel, and others. But we may arrive at the same result without altering a single letter, if we take &#1491;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489; as equivalent to &#1491;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489;, &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, to melt or pine away, whether we go back to the kal or to the hiphil of the verb, and regard the Mem as used in a material or local sense. We understand it, according to madmenah (dunghill) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-10.htm">Isaiah 25:10</a>, as denoting the place where they were reduced to pining away, i.e., as applied to Babylon as the house of servitude where Israel had been wearied to death. The tyrant's sceptre, mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-5.htm">Isaiah 14:5</a>, is the Chaldean world-power regarded as concentrated in the king of Babel (cf., she&#772;bet in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>). This tyrant's sceptre smote nations with incessant blows and hunting: maccath is construed with macceh, the derivative of the same verb; and murda&#770;ph, a hophal noun (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-3.htm">Isaiah 29:3</a>), with rodeh, which is kindred in meaning. Doederlein's conjecture (mirdath), which has been adopted by most modern commentators, is quite unnecessary. Unceasing continuance is expressed first of all with bilti, which is used as a preposition, and followed by sa&#770;ra&#770;h, a participial noun like ca&#770;la&#770;h, and then with b'li, which is construed with the finite verb as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-20.htm">Genesis 31:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-18.htm">Job 41:18</a>; for b'li cha&#770;sa&#770;k is an attributive clause: with a hunting which did not restrain itself, did not stop, and therefore did not spare. Nor is it only Israel and other subjugated nations that now breathe again. </body></html>
