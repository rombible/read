The use of the word, however, in mediæval Latin as a name of Satan, whose fall was supposed to be shadowed forth in this and the following verse, makes its selection here singularly unfortunate. Few English readers realise the fact that it is the king of Babylon, and not the devil, who is addressed as Lucifer. While this has been the history of the Latin word, its Greek and English equivalents have risen to a higher place, and the “morning star” has become a name of the Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-16.htm" title="I Jesus have sent my angel to testify to you these things in the churches.

By putting these and such like words into the mouths of the kings of Babylon, the prophet means to show their excessive pride, and the confidence which they entertained, that they should perpetually reign over the Jews.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-23 The whole plan of Divine Providence is arranged with a view to the good of the people of God. A settlement in the land of promise is of God's mercy. Let the church receive those whom God receives. God's people, wherever their lot is cast, should endeavour to recommend religion by a right and winning conversation. Those that would not be reconciled to them, should be humbled by them. This may be applied to the success of the gospel, when those were brought to obey it who had opposed it. God himself undertakes to work a blessed change. They shall have rest from their sorrow and fear, the sense of their present burdens, and the dread of worse. Babylon abounded in riches. The king of Babylon having the absolute command of so much wealth, by the help of it ruled the nations. This refers especially to the people of the Jews; and it filled up the measure of the king of Babylon's sins. Tyrants sacrifice their true interest to their lusts and passions. It is gracious ambition to covet to be like the Most Holy, for he has said, Be ye holy, for I am holy; but it is sinful ambition to aim to be like the Most High, for he has said, He who exalts himself shall be abased. The devil thus drew our first parents to sin. Utter ruin should be brought upon him. Those that will not cease to sin, God will make to cease. He should be slain, and go down to the grave; this is the common fate of tyrants. True glory, that is, true grace, will go up with the soul to heaven, but vain pomp will go down with the body to the grave; there is an end of it. To be denied burial, if for righteousness' sake, may be rejoiced in, Mt 5:12. But if the just punishment of sin, it denotes that impenitent sinners shall rise to everlasting shame and contempt. Many triumphs should be in his fall. God will reckon with those that disturb the peace of mankind. The receiving the king of Babylon into the regions of the dead, shows there is a world of spirits, to which the souls of men remove at death. And that souls have converse with each other, though we have none with them; and that death and hell will be death and hell indeed, to all who fall unholy, from the height of this world's pomps, and the fulness of its pleasures. Learn from all this, that the seed of evil-doers shall never be renowned. The royal city is to be ruined and forsaken. Thus the utter destruction of the New Testament Babylon is illustrated, Re 18:2. When a people will not be made clean with the besom of reformation, what can they expect but to be swept off the face of the earth with the besom of destruction?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>How art thou fallen from heaven - A new image is presented here. It is that of the bright morning star; and a comparison of the once magnificent monarch with that beautiful star. He is now exhibited as having fallen from his place in the east to the earth. His glory is dimmed; his brightness quenched. Nothing can be more poetic and beautiful than a comparison of a magnificent monarch with the bright morning star! Nothing more striking in representing his death, than the idea of that star falling to the earth!<p>Lucifer - Margin, 'Day-star' (&#1492;&#1497;&#1500;&#1500;  he&#772;yle&#772;l, from &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;  ha&#770;lal, "to shine"). The word in Hebrew occurs as a noun nowhere else. In two other places <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-12.htm">Ezekiel 21:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-2.htm">Zechariah 11:2</a>, it is used as a verb in the imperative mood of Hiphil, and is translated 'howl' from the verb &#1497;&#1500;&#1500;  ya&#772;lal, "to howl" or "cry." Gesenius and Rosenmuller suppose that it should be so rendered here. So Noyes renders it, 'Howl, son of the morning!' But the common translation seems to be preferable. The Septuagint renders it, &#x395;&#788;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  Heo&#772;sphoros, and the Vulgate, 'Lucifer, the morning star.' The Chaldee, 'How art thou fallen from high, who wert splendid among the sons of men.' There can be no doubt that the object in the eve of the prophet was the bright morning star; and his design was to compare this magnificent oriental monarch with that. The comparison of a monarch with the sun, or the other heavenly bodies, is common in the Scriptures.<p>Son of the morning - This is a Hebraism (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>), and signifies that that bright star is, as it were, the production, or the offspring of morning; or that it belongs to the morning. The word 'son' often thus denotes possession, or that one thing belongs to another. The same star in one place represents the Son of God himself; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a> : 'I am - the bright and morning star.'<p>Which didst weaken the nations - By thy oppressions and exactions, rendering once mighty nations feeble. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Isa 14:12-15.

And it is a very usual thing, both in prophetical and in profane writers, to describe the princes and potentates of the world under the title of the sun or stars of heaven. Some understand this place of the devil; to whom indeed it may be mystically applied; but as he is never called by this name in Scripture, so it cannot be literally meant of him, but of the king of Babylon, as is undeniably evident from the whole context, which certainly speaks of one and the same person, and describes him as plainly as words can do it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Song of Solomon of the morning:</span> the title of son is given in Scripture not only to a person or thing begotten or produced by another, but also in general to any thing which is any way related to another; in which sense we read of <span class="ital">a son of stripes</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-2.htm" title="And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number.">Deu 25:2</a></span>, <span class="ital">the son of a night</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-10.htm" title="Then said the LORD, You have had pity on the gourd, for the which you have not labored, neither made it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:">Jonah 4:10</a></span>, <span class="ital">a son of perdition</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-12.htm" title="While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name: those that you gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.">John 17:12</a></span>, and, which is more agreeable to the present case, <span class="ital">the sons of Arcturus</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-32.htm" title="Can you bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or can you guide Arcturus with his sons?">Job 38:32</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>How art thou fallen from heaven,.... This is not to be understood of the fall of Satan, and the apostate angels, from their first estate, when they were cast down from heaven to hell, though there may be an allusion to it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-18.htm">Luke 10:18</a> but the words are a continuation of the speech of the dead to the king of Babylon, wondering at it, as a thing almost incredible, that he who seemed to be so established on the throne of his kingdom, which was his heaven, that he should be deposed or fall from it. So the destruction of the Roman Pagan emperors is signified by the casting out of the dragon and his angels from heaven, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a> and in like manner Rome Papal, or the Romish antichrist, will fall from his heaven of outward splendour and happiness, of honour and authority, now, possessed by him: <p>O Lucifer, son of the morning! alluding to the star Venus, which is the phosphorus or morning star, which ushers in the light of the morning, and shows that day is at hand; by which is meant, not Satan, who is never in Scripture called Lucifer, though he was once an angel of light, and sometimes transforms himself into one, and the good angels are called morning stars, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a> and such he and his angels once were; but the king of Babylon is intended, whose royal glory and majesty, as outshining all the rest of the kings of the earth, is expressed by those names; and which perhaps were such as he took himself, or were given him by his courtiers. The Targum is, <p>"how art thou fallen from on high, who was shining among the sons of men, as the star Venus among the stars.'' <p>Jarchi, as the Talmud (c), applies it to Nebuchadnezzar; though, if any particular person is pointed at, Belshazzar is rather designed, the last of the kings of Babylon. The church of Rome, in the times of the apostles, was famous for its light and knowledge; its faith was spoken of throughout all the earth; and its bishops or pastors were bright stars, in the morning of the Gospel dispensation: <p>how art thou cut down to the ground; like a tall tree that is cut down, and laid along the ground, and can never rise and flourish more, to which sometimes great monarchs and monarchies are compared; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-18.htm">Isaiah 10:18</a> and this denotes that the king of Babylon should die, not a natural, but a violent death, as Belshazzar did, with whom the Babylonish monarchy fell, and never rose more; and this is a representation of the sudden, violent, and irrecoverable ruin of the Romish antichrist, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-21.htm">Revelation 18:21</a>, <p>which didst weaken the nations! by subduing them, taking cities and towns, plundering the inhabitants of their substance, carrying them captive, or obliging them to a yearly tribute, by which means he weakened them, and kept them under. So the Romish antichrist has got the power over many nations of the earth, and has reigned over the kings of it, and by various methods has drained them of their wealth and riches, and so greatly enfeebled them; nay, they have of themselves given their power and strength unto the beast, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-12.htm">Revelation 17:12</a>. Several of the Jewish writers observe, that the word here used signifies to cast lots; and so it is used in the Misna (d), and explained in the Talmud (e); and is applied to the king of Babylon casting lots upon the nations and kingdoms whom he should go to war with, and subdue first; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-19.htm">Ezekiel 21:19</a>. The Targum is, <p>"thou art cast down to the earth, who killedst the people:'' <p>a fit description of antichrist, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>. <p>(c) T.

The translation “Lucifer” (light-bearer) is quite correct, and is needlessly abandoned by the R.V.

The word translated "Lucifer" means properly "shining one," and no doubt here designates a star; but whether any particular star or no is uncertain. The LXX. translated by <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, whence our "Lucifer." The subjoined epithet, "son of the morning" or "of the dawn," accords well with this rendering. <span class="cmt_word">How art thou cut down to the ground!</span> One of Isaiah's favorite changes of metaphor. It is a favorite metaphor also to which he reverts - that of representing the destruction of a nation by the felling of a tree or of a forest (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-33.htm">Isaiah 10:33, 34</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Which didst weaken the nations</span>; rather, <span class="accented">which didst prostrate the nations</span>.

Instead of the hiphil hinniach (to let down) of <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-1.htm">Isaiah 14:1</a>, we have here, as in the original passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-19.htm">Deuteronomy 25:19</a>, the form he&#772;niach, which is commonly used in the sense of quieting, or procuring rest. &#1506;&#1510;&#1489; is trouble which plagues (as &#1506;&#1502;&#1500; is trouble which oppresses), and ro&#772;gez restlessness which wears out with anxious care (<a href="http://biblehub.com/job/3-26.htm">Job 3:26</a>, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-18.htm">Ezekiel 12:18</a>). The assimilated min before the two words is pronounced mi&#774;, with a weak reduplication, instead of me&#772;, as elsewhere, before &#1495;, &#1492;, and even before &#1512;    (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-28.htm">1 Samuel 23:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-16.htm">2 Samuel 18:16</a>). In the relative clause &#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1470;&#1489;&#1498; &#1488;&#1513;&#1512;, &#1488;&#1513;&#1512; is not the Hebrew casus adverb. answering to the Latin ablative qu servo te usi sunt; not do &#1489;&#1498; ... &#1488;&#1513;&#1512; belong to one another in the sense of quo, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-3.htm">Deuteronomy 21:3</a>, qu (vitul); but it is regarded as an acc. obj. according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-14.htm">Exodus 1:14</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39</a>, qu'on t'a fait servir, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-5.htm">Numbers 32:5</a>, qu'on donne la terre (Luzzatto). When delivered from such a yoke of bondage, Israel would raise a ma&#770;sha&#770;l. According to its primary and general meaning, ma&#770;sha&#770;l signifies figurative language, and hence poetry generally, more especially that kind of proverbial poetry which loves the emblematical, and, in fact, any artistic composition that is piquant in its character; so that the idea of what is satirical or defiant may easily be associated with it, as in the passage before us.<p>The words are addressed to the Israel of the future in the Israel of the present, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-1.htm">Isaiah 12:1</a>. The former would then sing, and say as follows. "How hath the oppressor ceased! The place of torture ceased! Jehovah hath broken the rod of the wicked, the ruler's staff, which cmote nations in wrath with strokes without ceasing subjugated nations wrathfully with hunting than nevers stays." Not one of the early translators ever thought of deriving the hap. leg. madheba&#770;h from the Aramaean dehab (gold), as Vitringa, Aurivillius, and Rosenmller have done. The former have all translated the word as if it were marhe&#772;ba&#770;h (haughty, violent treatment), as corrected by J. D. Michaelis, Doederlein, Knobel, and others. But we may arrive at the same result without altering a single letter, if we take &#1491;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489; as equivalent to &#1491;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489;, &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, to melt or pine away, whether we go back to the kal or to the hiphil of the verb, and regard the Mem as used in a material or local sense. We understand it, according to madmenah (dunghill) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-10.htm">Isaiah 25:10</a>, as denoting the place where they were reduced to pining away, i.e., as applied to Babylon as the house of servitude where Israel had been wearied to death. The tyrant's sceptre, mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-5.htm">Isaiah 14:5</a>, is the Chaldean world-power regarded as concentrated in the king of Babel (cf., she&#772;bet in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>). This tyrant's sceptre smote nations with incessant blows and hunting: maccath is construed with macceh, the derivative of the same verb; and murda&#770;ph, a hophal noun (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-3.htm">Isaiah 29:3</a>), with rodeh, which is kindred in meaning. Doederlein's conjecture (mirdath), which has been adopted by most modern commentators, is quite unnecessary. Unceasing continuance is expressed first of all with bilti, which is used as a preposition, and followed by sa&#770;ra&#770;h, a participial noun like ca&#770;la&#770;h, and then with b'li, which is construed with the finite verb as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-20.htm">Genesis 31:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-18.htm">Job 41:18</a>; for b'li cha&#770;sa&#770;k is an attributive clause: with a hunting which did not restrain itself, did not stop, and therefore did not spare. Nor is it only Israel and other subjugated nations that now breathe again. </body></html>
