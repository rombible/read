Here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-14.htm" title="The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.">Exodus 15:14</a>, “Palestina” is used, not in the wider meaning with which we are familiar, but specifically as the country of the Philistines. The historical circumstances connected with the “oracle” before us are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-18.htm" title="Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.">2Chronicles 18:18</a>. The Philistines had invaded the low country (<span class= "ital">Shetph</span>ē<span class= "ital">lah</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and the district known as the <span class= "ital">Negeb, </span>or “south” of Judah, in the reign of Ahaz. He had called in the help of Tiglath-pileser, the Assyrian king, to assist him as against Rezin and Pekah (Isaiah 7), so probably against these new invaders. Sargon (who succeeded Tiglath-pileser, B.C. 723) invaded Ashdod in B.C. 710 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-1.htm" title="In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it;">Isaiah 20:1</a>; <span class= "ital">Records of the Past, vii.</span> 40). Sennacherib records a like attack on Ashkelon and (according to Rawlinson’s interpretation) Ekron (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, vii.</span> 61). With these data we are able to enter on the interpretation of Isaiah’s prediction.<p><span class= "bld">Because the rod of him that smote thee is broken.</span>—The “rod,” as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-24.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwell in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite you with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against you, after the manner of Egypt.">Isaiah 10:24</a>, is the power of Tiglath-pileser. The Philistines were exulting in his death, or in that of Ahaz as his ally, as though their peril was past. They are told that their exultation was premature.<p><span class= "bld">Out of the serpent’s root.</span>—The three forms of serpent life (we need not be careful about their identification from the zoologist’s point of view) may represent the three Assyrian kings named above, from whose invasions the Philistines were to suffer. Each form was more terrible than the preceding. The fiery flying serpent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-6.htm" title="The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from where come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches on the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures on the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit them.">Isaiah 30:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-6.htm" title="And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.">Numbers 21:6</a>), which represented Sennacherib, was the most formidable of the three. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-1.htm" title="In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.">Isaiah 27:1</a>, the “piercing serpent,” the “crooked serpent,” and the “dragon” are symbols of the Assyrian power. Some critics, however, led chiefly by the first words of the next verse, find in the three serpents—(1) Ahaz, (2) Hezekiah, (3) the ideal king of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1-9</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:28-32 Assurance is given of the destruction of the Philistines and their power, by famine and war. Hezekiah would be more terrible to them than Uzziah had been. Instead of rejoicing, there would be lamentation, for the whole land would be ruined. Such destruction will come upon the proud and rebellious, but the Lord founded Zion for a refuge to poor sinners, who flee from the wrath to come, and trust in his mercy through Christ Jesus. Let us tell all around of our comforts and security, and exhort them to seek the same refuge and salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rejoice not thou - Rejoice not at the death of Ahaz, king of Judah. It shall be no advantage to thee. It shall not be the means of making an invasion on Judah more practicable.<p>Whole Palestina - We apply the name "Palestine" to the whole land of Canaan. Formerly, the name referred only to Philistia, from which we have derived the name Palestine. The word &#1508;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;  peleshet means properly the land of sojourners or strangers, from &#1508;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;  pa&#772;lash, "to rove about, to wander, to migrate." The Septuagint renders it, &#x391;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  Allophuloi - 'strangers,' or 'foreigners,' and &#x393;&#x3b7;&#834; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  Ge&#772; allophulo&#772;n - 'land of strangers.' Philistia was situated on the southwestern side of the land of Canaan, extending along the Mediterranean Sea from Gaza on the south, to Lydda on the north. The Philistines were a powerful people, and had often been engaged in wars with Judah. They had made a successful attack on it in the time of Ahaz; and amidst the feebleness and distractions which they supposed might succeed on the change of the government of Judah, and the administration of an inexperienced prince like Hezekiah, they hoped to be still more successful, and would naturally rejoice at the death of Ahaz. When the prophet says '" whole" Palestina,' he means to say that no part of Philistia would have occasion to rejoice at the succession of Hezekiah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a>).<p>Because the rod of him that smote thee is broken - It was not true that they had been smitten during the reign of Ahaz, but it had been done by his predecessor Uzziah. Perhaps the prophet refers to that prince, and to his death. He had smitten and subdued them. At his death they would rejoice; and their joy had been continued during the reigns of Jotham and Ahaz. They would now rejoice the more that a young and inexperienced prince was to ascend the throne. Their joy had been that "Uzziah" had died, and that joy had been augmenting since his death. But the prophet now tells them that they will have no further occasion for such joy.<p>For out of the serpent's root - That is, there shall spring forth from the serpent, or shall succeed the serpent, as a shoot or sprout springs from the root of a decayed tree (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>). By the serpent here, is undoutedly intended king Uzziah, who had so severely chastised the Philistines. The word 'serpent' &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;  na&#772;cha&#770;sh denotes a serpent of any kind, and usually one far less venomous than that which is meant by the word translated cockatrice. Probably the prophet does not give this name "serpent" to Uzziah or to Ahaz, or the name "cockatrice" to Hezekiah, because he regarded the names as properly descriptive of their character, but because they were so regarded by the Philistines. They were as odious and offensive to them, and as destructive of their plans, as venomous reptiles would be.<p>Shall come forth a cockatrice - (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-5.htm">Isaiah 59:5</a>). A basilisk, or adder, a serpent of most venomous nature (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-8.htm">Isaiah 11:8</a>). That is, though Uzziah is dead, yet there shall spring up from him one far more destructive to you than he was; one who shall carry the desolations of war much further, and who shall more effectually subdue you. Most commentators have concurred in supposing that Hezekiah is here referred to, who 'smote the Philistines even unto Gaza and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city' <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-8.htm">2 Kings 18:8</a>. This is, doubtless, the correct interpretation. The Chaldee renders it, however, 'Because there shall proceed from the descendants of Jesse the Messiah, and his works shall be among you as a flying serpent.' This interpretation Rosenmuller supposes is correct; but it is evidently foreign to the scope of the passage. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29.

Uzziah was doubtless regarded by the Philistines as a biting "serpent." But though the effects of his bite have been got rid of, a more deadly viper, or "cockatrice" (literally, "viper's offspring," as Philistia would regard him), namely, Hezekiah awaits you (2Ki 18:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Of him that smote thee:</span> most understand this of Uzziah, who did them much mischief, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-6.htm" title="And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.">2 Chronicles 26:6</a></span>; but he was dead thirty-two years before this time, and therefore their joy for his death was long since past.

It seems better to understand it more generally of the royal race or foregoing kings of Judah, who had been a terrible scourge to them, whose rod might be said to be broken, because that sceptre was come into the hands of slothful and degenerate princes, such as Ahaz was, who had been lately broken by the Philistines, and who probably was alive when this prophecy was delivered, because he here speaks of Hezekiah not as a present, but as a future king.

The land of the Philistines; the inhabitants of Palestine are meant, who rejoiced at the death of Uzziah, who was too powerful for them, and during the reign of Ahaz, of whom they had the better; and, now he was dead, they hoped things would still be more favourable to them, since a young prince, Hezekiah, succeeded him; but they would find, by sad experience, that they had no occasion to rejoice in these changes: "whole Palestine" is mentioned, because it was divided into five districts or lordships, over which there were five lords, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-4.htm">1 Samuel 6:4</a> and as they were all rejoicing in their late successes in Ahaz's time, and in hopes of still greater, so they would all suffer in the calamity hereafter threatened: <p>because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: meaning not Ahaz, for be did not smite the Philistines, but was smitten by them, for they invaded his country, and took many of his cities; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18</a> but rather Uzziah, who broke down the walls of their cities, and built others, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a> wherefore they rejoiced at his death; and their joy continued during the reigns of Jotham and Ahaz, and was increased at the death of Ahaz, a new and young king being placed on the throne. Some understand this of the breaking of the Assyrian, the rod of God's anger, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-25.htm">Isaiah 14:25</a> by whom the Philistines had been smitten, and therefore rejoiced at his ruin; and to this the Targum seems to incline, paraphrasing it thus, <p>"because the government is broken, whom ye served.'' <p>Such that interpret in this way, by the "serpent" after mentioned understand Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, whose successors were more troublesome to the Philistines than he; and by the "cockatrice" Sennacherib; and by the "fiery flying serpent" Nebuchadnezzar. Cocceius thinks that the sense of the prophecy is, that the Philistines should not rejoice at the sceptre being taken away from the Jews, and they being carried captive into Babylon, since it would not be to their advantage; for after Nebuchadnezzar and his sons, meant by the "serpent", should come the Medes and Persians, signified by the "cockatrice": and after them the Macedonians or Greeks, designed by the "flying fiery serpent", under Alexander, who should "kill" their "root", take Tyre their metropolis, at the siege of which was a famine; and then "slay their remnant", the city of Gaza, the last of their cities, whose inhabitants he slew; but the first sense of the prophecy, as it is most common, so most easy and natural: <p>for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice: that is, from the posterity, of Uzziah king of Judah, who greatly annoyed the Philistines, for which reason he is compared to a "serpent", should arise Hezekiah compared to a "cockatrice", because he would be, and he was, more harmful and distressing to them; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-8.htm">2 Kings 18:8</a>, <p>and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent; not the fruit of the cockatrice, but of the serpent; and intends the same as before, Hezekiah, likened to such a creature, because of the fury and swiftness with which he was to come, and did come, against the Philistines, and the hurt he did to them: the "serpent" to which he is compared is called "fiery", or "burning", because it inflames where it bites; of which see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a> and "flying", not because it has wings, though some serpents are said to have them; but because, when it leaps or darts upon a man, it is with such swiftness, that it seems to fly; the serpent called "acontias", or "serpens jaculus", is here alluded to. The Targum applies the passage to the Messiah, thus, <p>"for out of the children's children of Jesse shall come forth the Messiah, and his works shall be among you as a flying serpent.'' <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Rejoice not thou, all <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth an adder, and his fruit <i>shall be</i> a fiery flying serpent.</span><p>(r) He wills the Philistines not to rejoice because the Jews are diminished in their power, for their strength will be greater than it ever was.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">29</span>. <span class="ital">whole Palestina</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">Philistia, all of thee</span>.

It is probably a creation of the popular imagination, here used poetically.

Isaiah addresses the country as "whole Palestine," because, while it was made up of a number of principalities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-18.htm">1 Samuel 6:18</a>), his message concerned it in its entirety. <span class="cmt_word">The rod of him that smote thee is broken.</span> This can scarcely refer to the death of Ahaz, since Ahaz did not smite the Philistines, but was smitten by them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18</a>).

He con<span class="accented">quered</span> Ascalon ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 432) and Ekron (ibid., p. 433), and had the kings of Gaze and Ashdod among his tributaries (ibid., p. 438, note 11). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Thus far the prophet has spoken in the name of God. But the prophecy closes with a word of God Himself, spoken through the prophet. "And I will rise up against them, saith Jehovah of hosts, and root out in Babel name and remnant, sprout and shoot, saith Jehovah. And make it the possession of hedgehogs and marshes of water, and sweep it away with the bosom of destruction, saith Jehovah of hosts." &#1513;&#1501; &#1493;&#1513;&#1488;&#1512; and &#1504;&#1497;&#1503; &#1493;&#1504;&#1499;&#1491; are two pairs of alliterative proverbial words, and are used to signify "the whole, without exception" (compare the Arabic expression "Kiesel und Kies," "flint and pebble," in the sense of "altogether:" Nldecke, Poesie der alten Araber, p. 162). Jehovah rises against the descendants of the king of Babylon, and exterminates Babylon utterly, root and branch. The destructive forces, which Babylon has hitherto been able to control by raising artificial defences, are now let loose; and the Euphrates, left without a dam, lays the whole region under water. Hedgehogs now take the place of men, and marshes the place of palaces. The kippod occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-14.htm">Zephaniah 2:14</a>, in the company of birds; but according to the derivation of the word and the dialects, it denotes the hedgehog, which possesses the power of rolling itself up (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;), and which, although it can neither fly, nor climb with any peculiar facility, on account of its mode of walking, could easily get upon the knob of a pillar that had been thrown down (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-14.htm">Zephaniah 2:14</a>). The concluding threat makes the mode of Babel's origin the omen of its end: the city of &#1496;&#1497;&#1496;, i.e., Babylon, which had been built for the most part of clay or brick-earth, would be strangely swept away. The pilpel &#1496;&#1488;&#1496;&#1488; (or &#1496;&#1488;&#1496;&#1488;, as Kimchi conjugates it in Michlol 150ab, and in accordance with which some codices and early editions read &#1493;&#1496;&#1488;&#1496;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; with double zere) belongs to the cognate root which is mentioned at <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/42-5.htm">Psalm 42:5</a>, with an opening &#1491;, &#1496;, &#1505; (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-8.htm">Isaiah 27:8</a>), and which signifies to drive or thrust away. &#1502;&#1496;&#1488;&#1496;&#1488; is that with which anything is driven out or swept away, viz., a broom. Jehovah treats Babylon as rubbish, and sweeps it away, destruction (hashme&#772;d: an inf. absol. used as a substantive) serving Him as a broom. </body></html>
