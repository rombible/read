Christ is the light of the world. And by his grace he opens the understandings Satan has blinded, and sets at liberty from the bondage of sin. The Lord has supported his church. And now he makes new promises, which shall as certainly be fulfilled as the old ones were. When the Gentiles are brought into the church, he is glorified in them and by them. Let us give to God those things which are his, taking heed that we do not serve the creature more than the Creator.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/42.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, the former things are come to pass - That is, the former things which he had foretold. This is the evidence to which he appeals in proof that he alone was God, and this is the basis on which he calls upon them to believe that what he had predicted in regard to future things would also come to pass. He had by his prophets foretold events which had now been fulfilled, and this should lead them to confide in him alone as the true God.<p>And new things do I declare - Things pertaining to future events, relating to the coming of the Messiah, and to the universal prevalence of his religion in the world.<p>Before they spring forth - There is here a beautiful image. The metaphor is taken from plants and flowers, the word &#1510;&#1502;&#1495;  tsa&#770;mach properly referring to the springing up of plants, or to their sending out shoots, buds, or flowers. The phrase literally means, 'before they begin to germinate,' that is, before there are any indications of life, or growth in the plant. The sense is, that God predicted the future events before there was anything by which it might be inferred that such occurrences would take place. It was not done by mere sagacity - as men like Burke and Canning may sometimes predict future events with great probability by marking certain political indications or developments. God did this when there were no such indications, and when it must have been done by mere omniscience. In this respect, all his predictions differ from the conjectures of man, and from all the reasonings which are founded on mere sagacity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/42.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. former things&#8212;Former predictions of God, which were now fulfilled, are here adduced as proof that they ought to trust in Him alone as God; namely, the predictions as to Israel's restoration from Babylon.<p>new&#8212;namely, predictions as to Messiah, who is to bring all nations to the worship of Jehovah (Isa 42:1, 4, 6).<p>spring forth&#8212;The same image from plants just beginning to germinate occurs in Isa 43:19; 58:8.

Jehovah is still the speaker. He begins by promising a new revelation (ver. 9). Then, before the revelation is made, he calls upon the nations - especially those in the vicinity of Palestine  - to rejoice at what is about to happen (vers. 10-12). After this he proceeds to make the announcement promised in ver. 9  - an announcement that he is about to deliver his people (ver. 16) and to execute vengeance on their enemies (vers. 13-15 and 17). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the former things are come to pass</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> former prophecies have been fulfilled. Israel has been led lute captivity, and in her captivity has suffered grievous things. The reference is, perhaps, especially to such prophecies as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-5.htm">Isaiah 39:5-7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And new things do I declare</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>). The voluntary restoration of a captive people to their own land by the power to which they were subject, and which could compel their services, was emphatically a "new thing" in the world's history. How unwilling the sovereign power was ordinarily to lose such services may be seen by the narrative in Exodus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5.htm">Exodus 5-14</a>.), and again by the account which Herodotus gives (1:73, 74) of the ground of quarrel between Alyattes and Cyaxares. <span class="cmt_word">Before they spring forth</span>; or, <span class="accented">shoot forth.</span> The metaphor is one taken from the vegetable world (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-8.htm">Isaiah 45:8</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/42.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With this unassuming appearance there is associated a tender pastoral care. "A bruised reed He does not break, and a glimmering wick He does not put out: according to truth He brings out right." "Bruised:" ra&#770;tsu&#772;ts signifies here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6</a>, what is cracked, and therefore half-broken already. Glimmering: ke&#772;heh (a form indicative of defects, like &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;), that which is burning feebly, and very nearly extinguished. Tertullian understands by the "bruised reed" (arundinem contusam) the faith of Israel, and by the "glimmering wick" (linum ardens) the momentary zeal of the Gentiles. But the words hardly admit of this distinction; the reference is rather a general one, to those whose inner and outer life is only hanging by a slender thread. In the statement that in such a case as this He does not completely break or extinguish, there is more implied than is really expressed. Not only will He not destroy the life that is dying out, but He will actually save it; His course is not to destroy, but to save. If we explain the words that follow as meaning, "He will carry out right to truth," i.e., to its fullest efficacy and permanence (lxx &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;; instead of which we find &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, "unto victory," in <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-20.htm">Matthew 12:20</a>,<p>(Note: "Ad victoriam enim kri'sin perducit qui ad veritatem perducit." - Anger.)<p>as if the reading were &#1500;&#1504;&#1510;&#1495;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-4.htm">Habakkuk 1:4</a>), the connection between the first and last clauses of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-3.htm">Isaiah 42:3</a> is a very loose one. It becomes much closer if we take the &#1500; as indicating the standard, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-3.htm">Isaiah 11:3</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1</a>, and adopt the rendering "according to truth" (Hitzig and Knobel). It is on its subjective and practical side that truth is referred to here, viz., as denoting such a knowledge, and acknowledgement of the true facts in the complicated affairs of men, as will promote both equity and kindness. </body></html>
