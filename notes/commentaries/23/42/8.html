It follows from that meaning that God cannot look with indifference on the transfer to the “graven image” of the worship due to Him. With his vision of Cyrus still present to his thoughts, the prophet again presses the unique point of prediction as distinguishing the religion of Israel from that of the heathen. The “former things” refer probably not to the remote past, but to Isaiah’s earlier prophecies, say the whole Assyrian cycle, on which he now looks back from his new stand-point; or even, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-22.htm" title="Let them bring them forth, and show us what shall happen: let them show the former things, what they be, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us things for to come.">Isaiah 41:22</a>, to the near future of the conquests of Cyrus as compared with that which was to usher in the restoration of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/42.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/42-8.htm" title="I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images....">Isaiah 42:8-9</a></span>. <span class="ital">I am the Lord </span>— Hebrew, <span class="ital">Jehovah; </span>who have all being in and of myself, and give being to all my creatures.

Christ is the light of the world. And by his grace he opens the understandings Satan has blinded, and sets at liberty from the bondage of sin. The Lord has supported his church. And now he makes new promises, which shall as certainly be fulfilled as the old ones were. When the Gentiles are brought into the church, he is glorified in them and by them.

Here is also a change in the address. In the previous verses, God had addressed the Messiah. Here he turns to the people, and assures them that he is the only true God, and that he will not suffer the praise that is due to him to be given to any other, or to any graven image. The name Yahweh signifies being, or essential existence (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>). It is a name which is given to none but the true God, and which is everywhere in the Scriptures used to distinguish him from all others.<p>That is my name - That is the name which I have chosen by which to distinguish myself from all idols, and which I regard as appropriately expressive of my existence and perfections. Thus it is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-18.htm">Psalm 83:18</a> (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-5.htm">Psalm 96:5</a>). "And my glory." The glory, honor, or praise that is due to me.<p>Will I not give - I will not allow it to ascribed to another; I will not allow another to assume or receive the honor which is due to me.<p>To another - To any other; whether it be man, or whether it be an idol. God claims that all appropriate honors should be rendered to him, and that men should cherish no opinions, maintain no doctrines, indulge in no feelings, that would be derogatory to the honor of his name. This declaration is designed to counteract the propensity everywhere manifest to attribute to man that which belongs to God, or to ascribe to our own wisdom, skill, or power, that which he alone can accomplish.<p>Neither my praise - The praise which is due to me. He would not permit graven images to receive the praise of having done that which he himself had accomplished. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/42.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

Jehovah, a name expressive of his self-existence, eternity, and immutability; a name by which be made himself known to Israel of old, and which is peculiar to him, and does not belong to another, and so distinguishes him from all false gods; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a> or, "Hu is my name" (p); to which  "he himself the same", answers; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-27.htm">Psalm 102:27</a>, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a> and this is one of the names of God with the Jews (q); as Hou is with the Turks to this day; which, in Arabic, signifies "him": that is, God, as Monsieur Thevenot (r) observes; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-12.htm">Isaiah 48:12</a>, <p>and my glory will I not give to another; that is, to another god, to a strange god, to an idol; as that has not the nature, it ought not to have the name of deity, nor divine worship given to it: this the Lord will not admit of, but will punish those, be they Heathens, or are called Christians, that give the glory to idols that is due unto his name. This is not to be understood to the exclusion of the Son and Spirit, who are with the Father the one Jehovah, and share in the same glory; the Son is the brightness of his Father's glory, and the Spirit is the Spirit of glory, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a> nor will he suffer the glory of the justification, salvation, and conversion of men, to be given to their works, will, and power, which is entirely due to his own grace, to the blood and righteousness of his Son, and to the energy of the divine Spirit: <p>neither my praise to graven images; which serves to explain the former clause, what is meant by his "glory", and who by "another", to whom he will not give it. Papists should observe this, for it respects not merely or only the graven images of the Heathens, but chiefly those among them that bear the Christian name; for this relates to New Testament times. The Targum is, <p>"and my glory, in which I am revealed to you, I will not give to another people; nor my praise to worshippers of images.'' <p>(p)  (q) Seder Tephillot. fol. 1. 2. &amp; 4, 1. Ed.

"He will not cry, nor lift up, nor cause to be heard in the street, His voice." "His voice" is the object of "lift up," as well as "cause to be heard." With our existing division of the verse, it must at least be supplied in thought. Although he is certain of His divine call, and brings to the nations the highest and best, His manner of appearing is nevertheless quiet, gentle, and humble; the very opposite of those lying teachers, who endeavoured to exalt themselves by noisy demonstrations. He does not seek His own, and therefore denies Himself; He brings what commends itself, and therefore requires no forced trumpeting. </body></html>
