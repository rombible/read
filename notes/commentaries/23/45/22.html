None besides is able to help; he is the Saviour, who can save without the assistance of any, but without whom none can save. If the heart is brought into the obedience of Christ, the knee will cheerfully obey his commands. To Christ men shall come from every nation for blessings; all that hate his cause shall be put to shame, and all believers shall rejoice in him as their Friend and Portion. All must come to him: may we now come to him as the Lord our Righteousness, walking according to his commandments.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/45.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Look unto me, and be ye saved - This is said in view of the declaration made in the previous verse, that he is a just God and a Saviour. It is because he sustains this character that all are invited to look to him; and the doctrine is, that the fact that God is at the same time just and yet a Saviour, or can save consistently with his justice, is an argument why they should took to him, and confide in him. If he is at the same time just - true to his promises; righteous in his dealings; maintaining the honor of his law and government, and showing his hatred of sin; and also merciful, kind, and forgiving, it is a ground of confidence in him, and we should rejoice in the privilege of looking to him for salvation. The phrase 'look unto me' means the same as, direct the attention to as we do to one from whom we expect aid. It denotes a conviction on our part of helplessness - as when a man is drowning, he casts an imploring eye to one on the shore who can help him; or when a man is dying, he casts an imploring eye on a physician for assistance. Thus the direction to look to God for salvation implies a deep conviction of helplessness and of sin; and a deep conviction that he only can save. At the same time it shows the ease of salvation. What is more easy than to look to one for help? What more easy than to cast the eyes toward God the Saviour? What more reasonable than that he should require us to do it? And what more just than that God, if people will not look to him in order that they may be saved, should cast them off forever? Assuredly, if a dying, ruined, and helpless sinner will not do so simple a thing as to look to God for salvation, he ought to be excluded from heaven, and the universe will acquiesce in the decision which consigns him to despair.<p>All the ends of the earth - For the meaning of this phrase, see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>. The invitation here proves:<p>1. That the offers of the gospel are universal. None are excluded. The ends of the earth, the remotest parts of the world, are invited to embrace salvation, and all those portions of the world might, under this invitation, come and accept the offers of life.<p>2. That God is willing to save all; since he would not give an invitation at all unless he was willing to save them.<p>3. That there is ample provision for their salvation; since God could not invite them to accept of what was not provided for them, nor could he ask them to partake of salvation which had no existence.<p>4. That it is his serious and settled purpose that all the ends of the earth shall be invited to embrace the offers of life.<p>The invitation has gone from his lips, and the command has gone forth that it should be carried to every creature <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>, and now it pertains to his church to bear the glad news of salvation around the world. God intends that it shall be done, and on his church rests the responsibility of seeing it speedily executed.<p>For I am God - This is a reason why they should look to him to be saved. It is clear that none but the true God can save the soul. No one else but he can pronounce sin forgiven; no one but he can rescue from a deserved hell. No idol, no man, no angel can save; and if, therefore, the sinner is saved, he must come to the true God, and depend on him. That he may thus come, whatever may have been his character, is abundantly proved by this passage. This verse contains truth enough, if properly understood and applied, to save the world; and on the ground of this, all people, of all ages, nations, climes, ranks, and character, might come and obtain eternal salvation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/45.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. Look &#8230; and be ye saved&#8212;The second imperative expresses the result which will follow obedience to the first (Ge 42:18); ye shall be saved (Joh 3:14, 15). Nu 21:9: "If a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass he lived." What so simple as a look? Not do something, but look to the Saviour (Ac 16:30, 31). Believers look by faith, the eye of the soul. The look is that of one turning (see Margin) to God, as at once "Just and the Saviour" (Isa 45:21), that is, the look of conversion (Ps 22:27).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/45.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Upon these considerations, I advise all people upon earth, from one end to the other, to cast away their <span class="ital">idols</span>, and to turn their eyes and hearts to me, expecting salvation from me, and from me only; and their labour shall not be in vain; for they shall be saved: the imperative being put for the future, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-18.htm" title="And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:">Genesis 42:18</a></span>, and oft elsewhere. And this is not only an exhortation to the Gentiles to turn from <span class="ital">idols</span> to God, but a prediction that they shall turn to him, and look upon Christ, who shall be the author of salvation to all that obey him, whether Jews or Gentiles, which is confirmed by the following verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/45.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Look unto me,.... And not to idols, nor to any creature, nor to the works of your hands; to your own righteousness and doings; to your wounds; to your tears and humiliations; to your own hearts and frames; to your graces and the exercise of them; all must be looked off of, and Christ only looked unto by a direct act of faith, for righteousness, for pardon, for all supplies of grace, and for glory and eternal happiness. He is to be looked unto as the Son of God, whose glory is the glory of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth; as the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world; as the only Mediator between God and man; as the Saviour and Redeemer of lost sinners; and considered in all his offices and relations: under all circumstances he is to be looked to; when in the dark, look to him for light; when dead and lifeless, look to him for life; when weak, look to him for strength; when sick, look to him for healing; when hungry, look to him for food; and when disconsolate, look to him for comfort; for none ever look to him and are ashamed or disappointed, they have what they look for; and as it is profitable, so pleasant to look to Jesus, and he himself is well pleased with it; and therefore here encourages to it, adding, <p>and be ye saved; or, "ye shall be saved" (e): Christ is set up in the Gospel, and the ministration of it to be looked at, that men may be saved by him; and it is the will of God, not only that men should look to him, but that whosoever sees him, and believes in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life: the ministers of the Gospel are appointed to show men the way of salvation by Christ, and to assure them that he that believes in him shall be saved; and saints in all ages have looked unto him, and have been saved by him; and therefore this may be taken for a sure and certain thing, that such that look to Christ, as the Israelites did to the brasen serpent, the type of him, shall be saved, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14</a>, <p>all the ends of the earth; all that live at the furthest part of the earth; Christ has a people there, the Father has given him for his possession, and which are the purchase of his blood, and for whose sins he became the propitiation; and to these he sends his Gospel and his ministers, to find them out, and publish salvation to them, and to assure them, that however distant they are, both as to place and state, yet through looking to him by faith they shall be saved, even though they are the worst and vilest of sinners: <p>for I am God, and there is none else; and so mighty to save, able to save to the uttermost, all that come to him, and to God by him, be they where they will; since he is truly God, there is virtue enough in his blood to pardon sin, and cleanse from it; and in his righteousness to justify from all sin; and in his sacrifice to expiate it; and therefore sensible sinners may safely look to him, and venture their souls on him.

The second imperative expresses the consequence of the first: “Turn to Me and ye shall be saved.” “Salvation” here has still its ordinary sense of deliverance; although the great judgement is past, it is plainly assumed that only those who own Jehovah’s sovereignty shall be spared (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-23.htm" title="I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That to me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.">Isaiah 45:23</a></span>). But the thought that it depends on knowledge of the true God, who is the God of salvation, conveys the suggestion at least of a more positive meaning; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">22–25</span>.

Israel is redeemed by Jehovah with everlasting redemption: ye are not put to shame nor confounded to everlasting eternities." The perfects are expressive of the ideal past. Jehovah shows Himself as a Savour by the fact, that whereas the makers of idols perish, Israel is redeemed an everlasting redemption (acc. obj. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-6.htm">Isaiah 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-17.htm">Isaiah 22:17</a>; Ges. 138, 1, Anm. 1), i.e., so that its redemption is one that lasts for aeons (&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>) - observe that teshu&#772;&#8219;a&#770;h does not literally signify redemption or rescue, but transfer into a state of wide expanse, i.e., of freedom and happiness. The plural &#8219;o&#772;la&#770;m&#305;&#772;m (eternities  equals  &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; aeua) belongs, according to Knobel, to the later period of the language; but it is met with as early as in old Asaphite psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-6.htm">Psalm 77:6</a>). When the further promise is added, Ye shall not be put to shame, etc., this clearly shows, what is also certain on other grounds - namely, that the redemption is not thought of merely as an outward and bodily one, but also as inward and spiritual, and indeed (in accordance with the prophetic blending of the end of the captivity with the end of all things) as a final one. Israel will never bring upon itself again such a penal judgment as that of the captivity by falling away from God; that is to say, its state of sin will end with its state of punishment, even &#1506;&#1489; &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;, i.e., since &#1506;&#1491; has no plural, &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;. </body></html>
