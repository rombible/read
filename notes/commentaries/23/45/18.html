But how common to hear God called to account for his dealings with man! Cyrus provided for the returning Jews. Those redeemed by Christ shall be provided for. The restoration would convince many, and convert some; and all that truly join the Lord, find his service perfect freedom. Though God be his people's God and Saviour, yet sometimes he lays them under his frowns; but let them wait upon the Lord who hides his face. There is a world without end; and it will be well or ill with us, according as it shall be with us in that world. The Lord we serve and trust, is God alone. All that God has said is plain, satisfactory, and just. As God in his word calls us to seek him, so he never denied believing prayers, nor disappointed believing expectations. He gives grace sufficient, and comfort and satisfaction of soul.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/45.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For thus saith the Lord - This verse is designed to induce them to put uuwavering confidence in the true God. For this purpose, the prophet enumerates the great things which God had done in proof that he alone was A mighty, and was worthy of trust.<p>He hath established it - That is, the earth. The language here is derived from the supposition that the earth is laid upon a foundation, and is made firm. The Septuagint renders this, 'God who displayed the earth to view, and who, having made it, divided it (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;  dio&#772;risen aute&#772;n) that is, parcelled it out to be inhabited. This accords well with the scope of the passage.<p>He created it not in vain - He did not form it to remain a vast desert without inhabitants.<p>He formed it to be inhabited - By man, and the various tribes of animals. He makes it a convenient habitation for them; adapts its climates, its soil, and its productions, to their nature; and makes it yield abundance for their support. The main idea, I think, in the statement of this general truth, is, that God designed that the earth at large should be inhabited; and that, therefore, he intended that Judea - thru lying waste while the captives were in Babylon - should be re-populated, and again become the happy abode of the returning exiles. So Grotius interprets it. The Jews, from this passage, infer, that the earth shall be inhabited after the resurrection - an idea which has every probability, since there will not be fewer reasons why the earth shall be inhabited then than there are now; nor can there be any reasons why the earth should then exist in vain anymore than now.<p>And there is none else - (See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-6.htm">Isaiah 45:6</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/45.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

The Jews, from this passage, infer that, after the resurrection, the earth shall be inhabited, for there can be no reason why the earth should then exist in vain any more than now (2Pe 3:13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/45.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This description of God is here added, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

These words, and what follow, are the words of the Son of God, of the Lord the Saviour, in whom Israel is saved with an everlasting salvation; and this is said to assure them of it, as well as to distinguish himself from the gods of the Gentiles, who made not the heavens and the earth, as he had done; for by the Word of the Lord, the essential Word of God, were the heavens made in the beginning; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a>, <p>God himself, that formed the earth, and made it, he hath established it; the Saviour is God himself, truly and properly God, who has all the perfections of deity in him; and this appears as from his creation of the heavens, so from his forming, making and establishing the earth; he made the chaos of the earth out of nothing; he formed that chaos he made into a beautiful order, and prepared, as the last word (c) signifies, fitted, and furnished it with everything convenient for man and beast: <p>he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited; the earth indeed was "tohu" when it was first created, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, which word is used of the chaos of the earth first made, here rendered "in vain"; but then it was not created to continue so, nor did it continue so; for though it was first without form, it was soon formed in a beautiful manner, and fitted for the habitation of men and beasts, and especially the former; and more especially for the habitation of the saints, those sons of men, with whom the delights of Christ were from eternity, and whom he foresaw would dwell in the habitable parts of the earth, which was a pleasure to him; and for the sake of them was it made to be inhabited, and not by them with the wicked promiscuously only as now, but when purified, and refined by fire, to be the habitation of the righteous, with Christ at the head of them; as will be the case in the thousand years' reign: <p>I am the Lord, there is none else; the one Jehovah with the Father and the Spirit, and there is no other that is the Creator of the heavens and the earth. <p>(c) "parsvit eam", Musculus; "aptavit, instruit", Gataker; "exaptavit", Cocceius, Vitringa, <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/45.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be <span class="cverse3">{u}</span> inhabited: I <i>am</i> the LORD; and <i>there is</i> none else.</span><p>(u) That is, of men, but chiefly of his Church.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/45.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. The words <span class="ital">God himself</span> form a sort of parenthesis, and should be rendered as in R.V., <span class="bld">he is God</span> (or <span class="bld">the God</span>).

The names by which He calls Himself express his absolute blamelessness, and His absolute right of supremacy over Israel. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; is an imperative, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-8.htm">Genesis 23:8</a>; the third person would be written &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;.

The fault-finders in Israel were to leave the people of whom Jehovah was the Maker (a retrospective allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-10.htm">Isaiah 45:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9</a>), in the hands of Him who has created everything, and on whom everything depends. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-12.htm">Isaiah 45:12</a> "I, I have made the earth, and created men upon it; I, my hands have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I called forth." &#1497;&#1491;&#1497; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, according to Ges. 121, 3, is equivalent to my hands, and mine alone - a similar arrangement of words to those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-27.htm">Genesis 24:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-10.htm">2 Chronicles 28:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:15</a>. Hitzig is wrong in his rendering, "all their host do I command." That of Ewald is the correct one, "did I appoint;" for tsivva&#770;sh, followed by an accusative of the person, means to give a definite order or command to any one, the command in this case being the order to come into actual existence ( equals  esse jussi, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>). </body></html>
