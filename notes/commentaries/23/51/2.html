This should cause low thoughts of ourselves, and high thoughts of Divine grace. It is the greatest comfort to be made serviceable to the glory of God. The more holiness men have, and the more good they do, the more gladness they have. Let us seriously reflect upon our guilt. To do so will tend to keep the heart humble, and the conscience awake and tender.

They were directed to remember that God had taken Abraham and Sarah from a distant land, and that from so humble a beginning he had increased them to a great nation. The argument is, that he was able to bless and increase the exile Jews, though comparatively feeble and few.<p>For I called him alone - Hebrew, 'For one I called him;' that is, he was alone; there was but one, and he increased to a mighty nation. So Jerome, Quia unum vocavi eum. So the Septuagint, &#x39f;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; hoti heis e&#772;n - 'For he was one.' The point of the declaration here is, that God had called one individual - Abraham - and that he had caused him to increase until a mighty nation had sprung from him, and that he had the same power to increase the little remnant that remained in Babylon until they should again become a mighty people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/51.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. alone&#8212;translate, "I called him when he was but one" (Eze 33:24). The argument is: the same God who had so blessed "one" individual, as to become a mighty nation (Ge 12:1; 22:7), can also increase and bless the small remnant of Israel, both that left in the Babylonish captivity, and that left in the present and latter days (Zec 14:2); "the residue" (Isa 13:8, 9).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/51.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I called him</span> from his own country and kindred to follow me to an unknown land, where I promised that I would multiply and bless him, as is particularly explained, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/12-1.htm" title="Now the LORD had said to Abram, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and from your father's house, to a land that I will show you:...">Genesis 12:1-3</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Alone, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">one</span>; either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The strict rendering of the Massoretic text would be “that I might bless” &c.; but the verbs should no doubt be pointed as consec. impfs.
