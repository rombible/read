Gesenius (Commentary) says that three codices read &#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;  &#8219;ammiym ("peoples"), instead of &#1506;&#1502;&#1497;  &#8219;amiy ("my people"); and that thirteen MSS. read &#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;  le'u&#770;miym ("nations"), instead of &#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;  leu&#770;miy ("my nation"). Noyes also has adopted this reading. But the authority is too slight to justify a change in the text. The Vulgate reads it in accordance with the present Hebrew text, and so substantially do the Septuagint. They render it, 'Hear me, hear me, my people, and ye kings, give ear unto me.' It is not necessary to suppose any change in the text. The address is to the Jews; and the design is, to comfort them in view of the fact that the pagan would be brought to partake of the privileges and blessings of the true religion. They would not only be restored to their own land, but the true religion would be extended also to the distant nations of the earth. In view of this great and glorious truth, Yahweh calls on his people to hearken to him, and receive the glad announcement. It was a truth in which they were deeply interested, and to which they should therefore attend.<p>For a law shall proceed from me - The idea here is, that Yahweh would give law to the distant nations by the diffusion of the true religion.<p>And I will make my judgment to rest for a light - The word 'judgment' here is equivalent to law, or statute, or to the institutions of the true religion. The word rendered here 'to rest' (&#1506;&#1512;&#1490;&#1497;&#1506;  &#8219;aregiya&#8219; from &#1512;&#1490;&#1506;  ra&#770;ga&#8219;), Lowth renders, 'I will cause to break forth.' Noyes renders it, 'I will establish.' The Vulgate, Requiescet - 'Shall rest.' The Septuagint renders it simply, 'My judgment for a light of the nation.' The word properly means 'to make afraid,' to terrify, to restrain by threats; rendered 'divideth' in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-12.htm">Job 26:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-15.htm">Isaiah 51:15</a>; then, to be afraid, to shrink from fear, and hence, to be still, or quiet, as if cowering down from fear. Here it means that he would set firmly his law; he would place it so that it would be established and immovable. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/51.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. my people&#8212;the Jews. This reading is better than that of Gesenius: "O peoples &#8230; nations," namely, the Gentiles. The Jews are called on to hear and rejoice in the extension of the true religion to the nations; for, at the first preaching of the Gospel, as in the final age to come, it was from Jerusalem that the gospel law was, and is, to go forth (Isa 2:3).<p>law &#8230; judgment&#8212;the gospel dispensation and institutions (Isa 42:1, "judgment").<p>make &#8230; to rest&#8212;establish firmly; found.<p>light, &c.&#8212;(Isa 42:6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/51.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Hearken unto me, my people:</span> seeing the Gentiles will hearken to me, as I have formerly told you, take heed that you Jews, whom I chose to be my peculiar people, do not reject my counsel, nor forsake your own mercies, as I fear you will do. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A law; </span> a new law, even the doctrine of the gospel, which ought to have the force of a law with you, and I expect your obedience to it, no less than to my law delivered by Moses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will make my judgment to rest: judgment</span> is here the same thing with law in the former clause, the word of God, which is frequently called judgment, as hath been observed again and again, or the evangelical doctrine, of which he saith that he <span class="ital">will make it to rest</span>, i.e. settle and establish it; whereby he may-possibly intimate the stability and perpetuity of this light in the church, that it shall not be like the light of the Mosaical dispensation, which was only to shine for a season, even <span class="ital">until the time of reformation</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-10.htm" title="Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.">Hebrews 9:10</a></span>, when all those dark shadows were to vanish and give place to the Sun of righteousness, and to that kingdom and state that should never be moved, as we read, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-44.htm" title="And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.">Daniel 2:44</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/12-26.htm" title="Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he has promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven....">Hebrews 12:26-28</a></span>, and in many other places. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For a light of the people, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">of</span> or <span class="ital">to the peoples</span>; not only to you Jews, but unto people of all sorts and nations, who shall receive and walk in that light which you will reject, and use all possible endeavours to extinguish. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/51.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Hearken unto me, my people,.... His special people, whether Jews or Gentiles, chosen by him, taken into covenant with him; given to Christ, redeemed by him as a peculiar people, and called by his grace; these are exhorted to hearken to him; to his word, as the Targum; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-1.htm">Isaiah 51:1</a>, <p>and give ear unto me, O my nation; not the nation of the Jews only, but the Gentiles; a nation taken out of a nation, even out of all nations; a chosen and a holy nation. The Septuagint and Arabic versions render it "kings"; such are made kings and priests unto God: see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, <p>for a law shall proceed from me; not the Sinai law, but the Gospel; that doctrine that is said to go out of Zion, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>, as Kimchi rightly observes, who adds, <p>"for the King Messiah shall teach the people to walk in the ways of the Lord; and this shall be after the war of Gog and Magog:'' <p>and this law or doctrine of God comes from Christ, and is dictated, directed, and made effectual by his Spirit: <p>and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people; this is the same with the law, or doctrine of the Gospel, called "judgment", because it comes from the God of judgment, flows from his wisdom and counsel, and is a declaration of his will; it expands his method of justifying sinners, and is the means of awakening, convincing, and judging the consciences of men, and of informing and establishing the judgments of the saints, and by which the world will be judged at the last day. Now this is <p>for a light of the people; to enlighten unconverted ones, such who sit in darkness, to turn them from it, and call them out of it into marvellous light; and to illuminate the saints yet more and more, both with respect to doctrine and duty. And this is said to be made to "rest"; which denotes both the continuance of it in the world, until all the ends of it are answered; and the spiritual rest it gives to weary souls now, as well as points out to them that which remains for them hereafter. Though the words may be rendered, "I will cause my judgment to break forth" (h); like the morning, suddenly, and in a "moment" (i); to which agrees what follows. <p>(h) "erumpere faciam", De Dieu.

For <span class="ital">a law</span> (<span class="ital">tôrâh</span>) read, as usual, <span class="bld">instruction</span>. The word <span class="ital">judgment</span> in the next line is probably to be rendered “religion” as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.">Isaiah 42:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/42-3.htm" title="A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment to truth....">Isaiah 42:3-4</a> (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.">Isaiah 42:1</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The verb rendered “make to rest” has three meanings in the O.T. (<span class="ital">a</span>) to “cause to rest” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-2.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, The people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.">Jeremiah 31:2</a>) or “be at rest” (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-14.htm" title="The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.">Isaiah 34:14</a>), (<span class="ital">b</span>) to “set in commotion” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-34.htm" title="Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.">Jeremiah 50:34</a>, see on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-15.htm" title="But I am the LORD your God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The LORD of hosts is his name.">Isaiah 51:15</a></span> below), and (<span class="ital">c</span>) to “do a thing in the twinkling of an eye” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-19.htm" title="Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?">Jeremiah 49:19</a>). Of these (<span class="ital">a</span>) is alone possible in the present connexion, though hardly quite suitable; the sense “establish,” given by some critics, seems to have no sufficient support. By the LXX. the word is taken with <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-5.htm" title="My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and my arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait on me, and on my arm shall they trust.">Isaiah 51:5</a></span>, and in the sense (<span class="ital">c</span>), and this suggests the true reading, although it requires a slight modification of the following word. The construction would be the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-19.htm" title="Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?">Jeremiah 49:19</a>, and the rendering perhaps, “Suddenly I bring near my righteousness.” The word is at all events superfluous in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-4.htm" title="Listen to me, my people; and give ear to me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people.">Isaiah 51:4</a></span>, the last clause of which reads simply: <span class="bld">and my judgement for a light of the peoples</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-6.htm" title="And he said, It is a light thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give you for a light to the Gentiles, that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.">Isaiah 49:6</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">4–6</span>. The universal extension of the true religion is the second ground of comfort which the prophet is commissioned to offer to his fellow believers. The language of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/51-4.htm" title="Listen to me, my people; and give ear to me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people....">Isaiah 51:4-5</a></span> is obviously moulded on that of ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/42-1.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles....">Isaiah 42:1-4</a>; the functions there assigned to the Servant of the Lord are here assumed by Jehovah Himself. At the same time the thought is implied that the restored Israel is to be the bearer of salvation to the world at large, and thus the further idea is suggested that the ideal represented by the Servant will be realised by the people of Israel when it emerges purified from the discipline of the Captivity.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hearken unto me</span>; rather, <span class="accented">attend</span> to me - a stronger term than "hearken" - attend, and hear of a greater blessing than the restoration of the land of Judah to cultivation and fruitfulness.
