In this world of changes, it is a short step from joy to sorrow, but in that world, sorrow shall never come in view. They prayed for the display of God's power; he answers them with consolations of his grace. Did we dread to sin against God, we should not fear the frowns of men.

The Chaldee renders it, 'In the shadow of my power have I protected thee, that I might raise up the people of whom it was said, that they should be multiplied as the stars of heaven.' But the language here is evidently entirely figurative. It refers to the restoration of the Jews to their own land; to the re-establishment of religion there; to the introduction of the new economy under the Messiah, and to all the great changes which would be consequent on that. This is compared with the work of forming the heavens, and laying the foundation of the earth. It would require almighty power; and it would produce so great changes, that it might be compared to the work of creating the universe out of nothing. Probably also the idea is included here that stability would be given to the true religion by what God was about to do permanency that might be compared with the firmness and duration of the heavens and the earth.<p>And say unto Zion ... - That is, God would restore them to their own land, and acknowledge them as his own. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/51.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

The doctrines of God, and not men, as appears by their truth, purity, harmony and efficacy; they are the words of faith and sound doctrine, of peace and reconciliation, of pardon and righteousness, of salvation and eternal life; and these were put into the mouth of Christ, to be published and declared by him as the great Prophet of the church; for which he was abundantly qualified as man and Mediator, by being anointed with the Holy Ghost, without measure, and by having the tongue of the learned given him: hence he declares, that the doctrine he preached was not his own as man, but his Father's, and that he spoke nothing of himself, but what he heard of him, and was taught by him, and had a commandment from him to say; and which words or doctrines he delivered to his apostles, and put into their mouths to make known unto men; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-16.htm">John 7:16</a>. <p>And have covered thee in the shadow of my hand; protected and defended both the church and its members, Christ and his ministers, his interest and kingdom, his Gospel, and the truths of it, with its ordinances; and continued them from age to age, notwithstanding the virulence and violence of false teachers and persecutors, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-2.htm">Isaiah 49:2</a>, <p>that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth; form and establish Gospel churches in the world, in the Roman empire, and elsewhere, both by the words and doctrines of the Gospel; by the ministry of the apostles, and other preachers of the word; and by the hand of almighty power, the efficacious grace of God attending the same: so the Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions connect this clause with the former, <p>by which I have settled the heavens, &amp;c; these are called "heavens", for their purity, brightness, and glory they have from the Lord; for the doctrines and ordinances of the Gospel, which are from heaven, and not of men; and for the true members of them, which are men born from above, and partakers of the heavenly calling; and for the ministers of the Gospel, those stars of light, which here hold forth the light of the divine word to men; and where the sun of righteousness arises with healing in his wings, and where the clouds drop down the rain of heavenly doctrine: these are said to be "planted", as if they were gardens, as the churches of Christ are, planted with all kind of pleasant plants, with trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he may be glorified; and these, being watered with the dew of heaven, flourish and bring forth fruit: but planting rather denotes the stability and duration of the churches of Christ, which will continue as long as the days of heaven: or "that thou mayest plant" (t); referring either to the ministers of the word, who are instruments in planting churches, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-7.htm">1 Corinthians 3:7</a>, or to Christ, the chief master builder and founder of them; though this may principally respect the making of the new heaven, and the new earth, which will be of Christ's forming and making, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a> for it is not to be understood of the first making of the heavens and earth in a natural sense, or in a political sense of the settling and establishing of the Jewish nation: <p>and say unto Zion, thou art my people; the church of God, consisting whether of Jews or Gentiles, especially the latter, who once were not, but now, being called through the ministry of the word, are the people of God: and more particularly this will be declared and made manifest in the New Jerusalem state, when all the elect of God will be gathered in, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>. <p>(t) "ut plantes", V.

(1) It throws an important light on the idea of the Servant of the Lord. Language which is elsewhere used of the Servant is here applied to Israel, to whom the verse is undoubtedly addressed. This would be a strong confirmation of the theory that the Servant is in some sense a personification of Israel. (2) The conception of a new moral universe about to be created is partly anticipated both in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-6.htm" title="Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look on the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.">Isaiah 51:6</a></span> (where the transitoriness of the present world is asserted), and in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm" title="Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Are you not it that has cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?">Isaiah 51:9</a></span> f. (see the notes above). This verse, however, adds the further idea that the new creation is the ultimate goal of God’s dealings with Israel, whose religious mission culminates in a universal and everlasting salvation.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I have put my words in thy mouth</span>. Some commentators detach this verse altogether from the preceding passage, and regard it as a fragment intruded here out of its proper place by some unaccountable accident. From the close resemblance of the expressions used to those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-2.htm">Isaiah 49:2</a>, they consider that the person addressed must be "the Servant of Jehovah," and hence conclude that the verse "originally stood in some other context" (Cheyne). It is, however, quite possible to regard Israel as still addressed; since Israel too was the recipient of God's words (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-21.htm">Isaiah 59:21</a>), and was protected by God's hand from destruction, and kept in existence until the happy time should come when God would create a new heaven and a new earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>) for Israel's dwelling-place<span class="cmt_word">, and say unto Zion</span> - <span class="accented">i.e. to</span> the "new Jerusalem" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">Thou art my people</span>. This crowning promise well terminates the comforting address wherewith Jehovah at this time saw fit to cheer and encourage his captive people. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/51.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But just as such an exhortation as this followed very naturally from the grand promises with which they prophecy commenced, so does a longing for the promised salvation spring out of this exhortation, together with the assurance of its eventual realization. "Awake, awake, clothe thyself in might, O arm of Jehovah; awake, as in the days of ancient time, the ages of the olden world! Was it not thou that didst split Rahab in pieces, and pierced the dragon? Was it not thou that didst dry up the sea, the waters of the great billow; that didst turn the depths of the sea into a way for redeemed to pass through? Ad the emancipated of Jehovah will return, and come to Zion with shouting, and everlasting joy upon their head: they grasp at gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing flee away." The paradisaical restoration of Zion, the new world of righteousness and salvation, is a work of the arm of Jehovah, i.e., of the manifestation of His might. His arm is now in a sleeping state. It is not lifeless, indeed, but motionless. Therefore the church calls out to it three times, "Awake" (&#8219;u&#772;r&#305;&#772;: to avoid monotony, the milra and milel tones are interchanged, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-12.htm">Judges 5:12</a>).<p>(Note: See Norzi and Luzzatto's Grammatica della Lingua Ebr. 513.)<p>It is to arise and put on strength out of the fulness of omnipotence (la&#770;bhe&#772;sh as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/93-1.htm">Psalm 93:1</a>; cf., &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-17.htm">Revelation 11:17</a>, and &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bf; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;, arm thyself with strength, in Il. 19:36; 9:231). The arm of Jehovah is able to accomplish what the prophecy affirms and the church hopes for; since it has already miraculously redeemed Israel once. Rahabh is Egypt represented as a monster of the waters (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-7.htm">Isaiah 30:7</a>), and tann&#305;&#772;n is the same (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>), but with particular reference to Pharaoh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>). &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488;, tu illud, is equivalent to "thou, yea thou" (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-16.htm">Isaiah 37:16</a>). The Red Sea is described as the "waters of the great deep" (teho&#772;m rabba&#770;h), because the great storehouse of waters that lie below the solid ground were partially manifested there. &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1502;&#1492; has double pashta; it is therefore milel, and therefore the third pr.  equals  &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; (Ges. 109, Anf.). <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a> is repeated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-11.htm">Isaiah 51:11</a>, being attached to &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; of the previous verse, jut as it is there. Instead of &#1504;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468; &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1497;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, which we find here, we have there &#1493;&#1504;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468; &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1497;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;; in everything else the two passages are word for word the same. Hitzig, Ewald, and Knobel suppose that <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-11.htm">Isaiah 51:11</a> was not written by the author of these addresses, but was interpolated by some one else. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a> we meet with just the same kind of repetition from chapters 1-39; and in the first part we find, at any rate, repetitions in the form of refrains and others of a smaller kind (like <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-15.htm">Isaiah 19:15</a>, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-13.htm">Isaiah 9:13</a>). And <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-11.htm">Isaiah 51:11</a> forms a conclusion here, just as it does in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>. An argument is founded upon the olden time with reference to the things to be expected now; the look into the future is cleared and strengthened by the look into the past. And thus will the emancipated of Jehovah return, being liberated from the present calamity as they were delivered from the Egyptian then. The first half of this prophecy is here brought to a close. It concludes with expressions of longing and of hope, the echo of promises that had gone before. </body></html>
