He that designs such joy for us at last, will he not work such deliverance in the mean time, as our cases require? In this world of changes, it is a short step from joy to sorrow, but in that world, sorrow shall never come in view. They prayed for the display of God's power; he answers them with consolations of his grace. Did we dread to sin against God, we should not fear the frowns of men. Happy is the man that fears God always. And Christ's church shall enjoy security by the power and providence of the Almighty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But I am the Lord thy God - In order to show them that he was able to save them, God again refers to the fact that he had divided the sea, and delivered their fathers from bondage and oppression.<p>That divided the sea - The Red Sea. The Chaldee renders this, 'That rebuked the sea.' The Septuagint, &#x39f;&#788; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  ho tarasso&#772;n - 'Who disturbs the sea.' or, who excites a tempest. Lowth renders it, 'Who stilleth at once the sea.' The Hebrew word is the same which occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-4.htm">Isaiah 51:4</a>, where it is rendered, 'I will make my judgment to rest' (&#1512;&#1490;&#1506;  ra&#770;ga&#8219;). Probably the idea here is, that he restrains the raging of the sea as if by fear; that is, makes it tranquil or still by rebuking it. He had this power over all raging seas, and he had shown it in a special manner by his rebuking the Red Sea and making it rest, and causing a way to be made through it, when the children of Israel came out of Egypt.<p>The Lord of hosts is his name - (See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/51.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. divided &#8230; sea&#8212;the Red Sea. The same Hebrew word as "make to rest" (Isa 51:4). Rather, "that terrify the sea," that is, restrain it by My rebuke, "when its waves roar" [Gesenius]. The Hebrew favors Maurer, "that terrify the sea so that the waves roar." The sense favors Gesenius (Jer 5:22; 31:35), or English Version (Isa 51:9, 10, which favors the special reference to the exodus from Egypt).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/51.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/51.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But I am the Lord thy God that divided the sea, whose waves roared,....

Or this is to be understood of the power of God at any time in stilling and quieting the sea when it rages; which signification the word (s) here used has, as Aben Ezra observes; which power is expressed by a rebuke or reproof of it. And so the Targum, <p>"I am the Lord thy God, that rebuketh the sea:'' <p>and in like manner the Syriac version; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-9.htm">Psalm 106:9</a> with which compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-26.htm">Matthew 8:26</a>.

The reference is once more to the great miracle wrought at the Exodus, when the Red Sea was "divided" before the host of Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whose waves roared</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-27.htm">Exodus 14:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-10.htm">Exodus 15:10</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/51.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But just as such an exhortation as this followed very naturally from the grand promises with which they prophecy commenced, so does a longing for the promised salvation spring out of this exhortation, together with the assurance of its eventual realization. "Awake, awake, clothe thyself in might, O arm of Jehovah; awake, as in the days of ancient time, the ages of the olden world! Was it not thou that didst split Rahab in pieces, and pierced the dragon? Was it not thou that didst dry up the sea, the waters of the great billow; that didst turn the depths of the sea into a way for redeemed to pass through? Ad the emancipated of Jehovah will return, and come to Zion with shouting, and everlasting joy upon their head: they grasp at gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing flee away." The paradisaical restoration of Zion, the new world of righteousness and salvation, is a work of the arm of Jehovah, i.e., of the manifestation of His might. His arm is now in a sleeping state. It is not lifeless, indeed, but motionless. Therefore the church calls out to it three times, "Awake" (&#8219;u&#772;r&#305;&#772;: to avoid monotony, the milra and milel tones are interchanged, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-12.htm">Judges 5:12</a>).<p>(Note: See Norzi and Luzzatto's Grammatica della Lingua Ebr. 513.)<p>It is to arise and put on strength out of the fulness of omnipotence (la&#770;bhe&#772;sh as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/93-1.htm">Psalm 93:1</a>; cf., &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-17.htm">Revelation 11:17</a>, and &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bf; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;, arm thyself with strength, in Il. 19:36; 9:231). The arm of Jehovah is able to accomplish what the prophecy affirms and the church hopes for; since it has already miraculously redeemed Israel once. Rahabh is Egypt represented as a monster of the waters (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-7.htm">Isaiah 30:7</a>), and tann&#305;&#772;n is the same (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>), but with particular reference to Pharaoh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>). &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488;, tu illud, is equivalent to "thou, yea thou" (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-16.htm">Isaiah 37:16</a>). The Red Sea is described as the "waters of the great deep" (teho&#772;m rabba&#770;h), because the great storehouse of waters that lie below the solid ground were partially manifested there. &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1502;&#1492; has double pashta; it is therefore milel, and therefore the third pr.  equals  &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; (Ges. 109, Anf.). <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a> is repeated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-11.htm">Isaiah 51:11</a>, being attached to &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; of the previous verse, jut as it is there. Instead of &#1504;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468; &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1497;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, which we find here, we have there &#1493;&#1504;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468; &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1497;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;; in everything else the two passages are word for word the same. Hitzig, Ewald, and Knobel suppose that <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-11.htm">Isaiah 51:11</a> was not written by the author of these addresses, but was interpolated by some one else. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a> we meet with just the same kind of repetition from chapters 1-39; and in the first part we find, at any rate, repetitions in the form of refrains and others of a smaller kind (like <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-15.htm">Isaiah 19:15</a>, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-13.htm">Isaiah 9:13</a>). And <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-11.htm">Isaiah 51:11</a> forms a conclusion here, just as it does in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>. An argument is founded upon the olden time with reference to the things to be expected now; the look into the future is cleared and strengthened by the look into the past. And thus will the emancipated of Jehovah return, being liberated from the present calamity as they were delivered from the Egyptian then. The first half of this prophecy is here brought to a close. It concludes with expressions of longing and of hope, the echo of promises that had gone before. </body></html>
