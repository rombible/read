He compares the bodies of Abraham and Sarah unto a rock, or pit, or quarry, out of which stones are hewn or dug; thereby implying, that God, in some sort, actually did that which John the Baptist said he was able to do, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-9.htm" title="And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.">Matthew 3:9</a>,) even of <span class="ital">stones to raise up children unto Abraham; </span>it being then as impossible, by the course of nature, for Abraham and Sarah, in such an advanced age as they then were, to have a child, as it is to hew one out of a rock, or dig one out of a pit. <span class="ital">For I called him alone </span>— Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">אחד</span>, <span class="ital">one; </span>that is, when he was but one single person, without child or family, I called him from his country and kindred to follow me to an unknown land, where I promised that I would multiply him exceedingly. <span class="ital">And I blessed him, and increased him </span>— Namely, into a vast multitude, when his condition was desperate in the eye of reason. And therefore God can as easily deliver and raise his church when they are in the most forlorn condition, and seem to be consumed, dead, and buried, so that nothing but dry bones remain of them, as is declared at large, Ezekiel chap. 37.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/51.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>51:1-3 It is good for those privileged by the new birth, to consider that they were shapen in sin. This should cause low thoughts of ourselves, and high thoughts of Divine grace. It is the greatest comfort to be made serviceable to the glory of God. The more holiness men have, and the more good they do, the more gladness they have. Let us seriously reflect upon our guilt. To do so will tend to keep the heart humble, and the conscience awake and tender.

They are regarded as in exile and bondage, and as desponding in regard to their prospects. In this situation, God, or perhaps more properly the Messiah (compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1.htm">Isaiah 1</a>), is introduced as addressing them with the assurances of deliverance.<p>Ye that follow after righteousness - This is addressed evidently to those who sought to be righteous, and who truly feared the Lord. There was a portion of the nation that continued faithful to Yahweh. They still loved and worshipped him in exile, and they were anxiously looking for deliverance and for a return to their own land.<p>Look unto the rock whence ye are hewn - To Abraham the founder of the nation. The figure is taken from the act of quarrying stone for the purposes of building; and the essential idea here is, that God had formed the nation from the beginning, as a mason constructs a building; that he had, so to speak, taken the materials rough and unhewn from the very quarry; that he had shaped, and fitted them, and moulded them into an edifice. The idea is not that their origin was dishonorable or obscure. It is not that Abraham was not an honored ancestor, or that they should be ashamed of the founder of their nation. But the idea is, that God had had the entire moulding of the nation; that he had taken Abraham and Sarah from a distant land, and bad formed them into a great people and nation for his own purpose. The argument is, that he who had done this was able to raise them up from captivity, and make them again a great people. Probably allusion is made to this passage by the Saviour in <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9</a>, where he says, 'For I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.'<p>The hole of the pit - The word rendered 'hole' means such an excavation as men make who are taking stones from a quarry. It expresses substantially the same idea as the previous member of the verse. This language is sometimes addressed to Christians, with a view to produce humility by reminding them that they have been taken by God from a state of sin, and raised up, as it were, from a deep and dark pit of pollution. But this is not the sense of the passage, nor will it bear such an application. It may be used to denote that God has taken them, as stone is taken from the quarry; that he found them in their natural state as unhewn blocks of marble are; that he has moulded and formed them by his own agency, and fitted them into his spiritual temple; and that they owe all the beauty and grace of their Christian deportment to him; that this is an argument to prove that he who had done so much for them as to transform them, so to speak, from rough and unsightly blocks to polished stones, fitted for his spiritual temple on earth, is able to keep them still, and to fit them for his temple above. Such is the argument in the passage before us; and such a use of it is, of course, perfectly legitimate and fair. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/51.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 51<p>Isa 51:1-23.

After having declared the doom of the wicked, and those that trust to their own righteousness, the Lord returns to them that fear him, whom he describes as such that "follow after righteousness"; not the righteousness of the law, it is the character of carnal Israel to follow after that; nor is that attainable in the way it is pursued by such; nor is there any justification by it; nor is following that consistent with seeking the Lord, in the next clause: but the righteousness of Christ is meant; not his essential righteousness as God; nor the righteousness of his office as Mediator; but that which consists of his active and passive obedience; of which he is the author and giver, and is in him as its subject: this is what is commonly called imputed righteousness, an evangelical one, the righteousness of faith, and is justifying: "following after" this supposes a want of one; a sense of that want; a view of this as out of themselves, and in another; a love and liking of it, and a vehement desire for it; and what determines to an eager pursuit of it are its perfection, suitableness, and use: now such persons are called to hearken to the Lord; to the Word of the Lord, as the Targum; to Christ, to his Gospel, and to his ordinances, particularly to what is after said: <p>ye that seek the Lord: the Lord Christ, for life and salvation; for righteousness and strength; for more grace from him; a greater knowledge of him, and of doctrine from him, as the Targum; and more communion with him; that seek his honour and glory in the world, and to be for ever with him; who seek first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; that seek him where he may be found, affectionately and sincerely, carefully, diligently, constantly, and for everything they want: <p>look unto the rock whence ye are hewn; which is in the next verse interpreted of Abraham; so called, not so much for the strength of his faith, as for his old age; when he looked like a hard dry rock, from whom no issue could be expected; and yet from hence a large number of stones were hewn, or a race of men sprung: <p>and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged; that is, to Sarah, who was for a long time barren, whose womb was shut up, but afterwards opened; and from whom, as from a cistern, (to which a wife is sometimes compared, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-15.htm">Proverbs 5:15</a>) flowed the waters of Judah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-1.htm">Isaiah 48:1</a> or the Jewish nation. Jerom thinks Christ is meant by both, the Rock of ages, in whom is everlasting strength; to whom men are to look for salvation, righteousness, and strength; and out of whose pierced side flowed blood and water: and in this sense he is followed by Cocceius, who interprets the rock of Christ, the Rock of salvation; out of whose side flowed the church, as out of the hole of a pit or cistern. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/51.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Hearken to me, <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the LORD: look to the <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> rock <i>from which</i> ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit <i>from which</i> ye were dug.</span><p>(a) He comforts the Church, that they would not be discouraged for their small number.<p>(b) That is, to Abraham, of whom you were begotten, and to Sarah of whom we were born.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/51.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">ye that follow after</span> (lit. “pursue”) <span class="ital">righteousness</span>] “Righteousness” here means, not “salvation” (as in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/51-5.htm" title="My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and my arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait on me, and on my arm shall they trust....">Isaiah 51:5-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-8.htm" title="For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.">Isaiah 51:8</a></span>), but righteousness in conduct, a way of life in accordance with the will of God (as <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-7.htm" title="Listen to me, you that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear you not the reproach of men, neither be you afraid of their revilings.">Isaiah 51:7</a></span>); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-9.htm" title="The way of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but he loves him that follows after righteousness.">Proverbs 15:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-30.htm" title="What shall we say then?

The opening exhortation alludes to a difficulty naturally arising in the minds of believing exiles, viz., that they were too few in number to inherit the glorious promises made to them. This is removed by pointing to the marvellous increase of the nation from a single patriarchal family. There is a curious coincidence between this passage and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-24.htm" title="Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.">Ezekiel 33:24</a>, where a parallel line of reasoning, on the part of the ungodly remnant left in the land of Canaan, is denounced by the prophet as impious.

Encouragements addressed to true Israelites<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The strain of consolation, which was interrupted by the soliloquy of the Servant at ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-4.htm" title="The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakens morning by morning, he wakens my ear to hear as the learned.">Isaiah 50:4</a>, is now resumed, and is continued till we reach the fourth and last of the Servant-passages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-13.htm" title="Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.">Isaiah 52:13</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-12.htm" title="Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he has poured out his soul to death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.">Isaiah 53:12</a>. Throughout this long passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-1.htm" title="Listen to me, you that follow after righteousness, you that seek the LORD: look to the rock from where you are hewn, and to the hole of the pit from where you are dig.">Isaiah 51:1</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-12.htm" title="For you shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rear guard.">Isaiah 52:12</a>) the prophet’s thoughts are occupied with the near prospect of deliverance, and his high-strung emotion finds vent in a series of short impassioned oracles, mostly of a lyrical character. These may be divided into two groups, each consisting of three oracles. While those of the second group (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-17.htm" title="Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which have drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; you have drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.">Isaiah 51:17</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-12.htm" title="For you shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rear guard.">Isaiah 52:12</a>) are addressed to the prostrate and desolate Zion, the first (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/51-1.htm" title="Listen to me, you that follow after righteousness, you that seek the LORD: look to the rock from where you are hewn, and to the hole of the pit from where you are dig....">Isaiah 51:1-16</a>) contains words of cheer to the faithful but timid hearts in whom the prophet’s message had found an entrance. This section shews some points of contact with the preceding descriptions of the Servant, and the line of thought was probably influenced by the last of these, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/50-4.htm" title="The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakens morning by morning, he wakens my ear to hear as the learned....">Isaiah 50:4-9</a>. The contents of the section are as follows:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>i. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/51-1.htm" title="Listen to me, you that follow after righteousness, you that seek the LORD: look to the rock from where you are hewn, and to the hole of the pit from where you are dig....">Isaiah 51:1-8</a></span>. A glowing and animated appeal to the believing exiles to put away the fears and misgivings which hinder their full acceptance of the promise of salvation. The thrice-repeated “Hearken to me” (see, however, on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-4.htm" title="Listen to me, my people; and give ear to me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people.">Isaiah 51:4</a></span>) indicates a division into three strophes. (1) The first draws a lesson of encouragement from the example of the solitary patriarch Abraham, who by the blessing of Jehovah became the progenitor of a great nation. Let the true-hearted believers, therefore, take courage, in spite of the fewness of their number, for the same blessing rests on them, and will transform the waste places of Zion into a scene of joy and gladness (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/51-1.htm" title="Listen to me, you that follow after righteousness, you that seek the LORD: look to the rock from where you are hewn, and to the hole of the pit from where you are dig....">Isaiah 51:1-3</a></span>). (2) The next strophe directs the hope of the loyal Israelites to the glorious future that belongs to those who wait for Jehovah’s salvation; though heaven and earth pass away that world-wide salvation is imperishable and eternal (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/51-4.htm" title="Listen to me, my people; and give ear to me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people....">Isaiah 51:4-6</a></span>). (3). The last strophe, re-echoing one of the voices of the Prologue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/40-6.htm" title="The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field:...">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>), reminds the exiles that the reproach they fear is that of frail and short-lived mortals, while the salvation they hope for endures for ever.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>ii. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/51-9.htm" title="Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Are you not it that has cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?...">Isaiah 51:9-10</a></span>. Here for a moment the prophetic discourse is interrupted by a magnificent apostrophe to the “arm” of Jehovah. The speakers are most probably those to whom the previous words were addressed. As if all their doubts had been swept away by the impressive appeals to which they have listened, their impatience breaks forth in this impetuous challenge to Jehovah to reveal His power as in the days of old. (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-11.htm" title="Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing to Zion; and everlasting joy shall be on their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.">Isaiah 51:11</a></span> has been inserted from ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-10.htm" title="And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy on their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.">Isaiah 35:10</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>iii. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/51-12.htm" title="I, even I, am he that comforts you: who are you, that you should be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass;...">Isaiah 51:12-16</a></span>. The Divine voice is again heard (in answer to the people’s prayer). Since their comforter is Jehovah Himself, the Creator of heaven and earth, how unreasonable is their craven fear of their cruel oppressors! (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/51-12.htm" title="I, even I, am he that comforts you: who are you, that you should be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass;...">Isaiah 51:12-13</a></span>).

He put him into a position inwardly to discern His will, that he might become the mediator of divine revelation; and he did not set himself against this calling (ma&#770;ra&#770;h, according to its radical meaning stringere, to make one's self rigid against any one, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;), and did not draw back from obeying the call, which, as he well knew, would not bring him earthly honour and gain, but rather shame and ill-treatment. Ever since he had taken the path of his calling, he had not drawn timidly back from the sufferings with which it was connected, but had rather cheerfully taken them upon him. V.6 "I offered my back to smiters, and my cheeks to them that pluck off the hair; I hid not my face from shame and spitting."

He did not hide his face, to cover it up from actual insults, or from being spit upon (on kelimmo&#772;th with  ro&#772;q, smiting on the cheek, &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, strokes with rods, &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, blows upon the head, &#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; with &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-67.htm">Matthew 26:67</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-30.htm">Matthew 27:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-22.htm">John 18:22</a>). The way of his calling leads through a shameful condition of humiliation. What was typified in Job (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-6.htm">Isaiah 17:6</a>), and prefigured typically and prophetically in the Psalms of David (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-8.htm">Psalm 69:8</a>), finds in him its perfect antitypical fulfilment. </body></html>
