The description of bloodshed suggests tremendous ideas of the Divine judgments. Idumea here denotes the nations at enmity with the church; also the kingdom of antichrist. Our thoughts cannot reach the horrors of that awful season, to those found opposing the church of Christ. There is a time fixed in the Divine counsels for the deliverance of the church, and the destruction of her enemies. We must patiently wait till then, and judge nothing before the time.

This passage bas given much perplexity to commentators, on account of the apparent want of meaning of the expression that the sword would be bathed in heaven. Lowth reads it:<p>For my sword is made bare in the heavens;<p>Following in this the Chaldee which reads &#1514;&#1514;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;  t&#305;&#770;thgall&#305;&#770;y, 'shall be revealed.' But there is no authority from manuscripts for this change in the Hebrew text. The Vulgate renders it, Quoniam inebriatus est in coelo gladius meuse - 'My sword is intoxicated in heaven.' The Septuagint renders it in the same way, &#x395;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;  Emethusthe&#772; he&#772; machaira mou en to&#772; ourano&#772;; and the Syriac and Arabic in the same manner. The Hebrew word &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;  riveta&#770;h, from &#1512;&#1493;&#1492;  ra&#770;va&#770;h, means properly to drink to the full; to be satisfied, or sated with drink; and then to be full or satiated with intoxicating liquor, to be drunk. It is applied to the sword, as satiated or made drunk with blood, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-10.htm">Jeremiah 46:10</a> :<p>And the sword shall devour,<p>And it shall be satiate, and made drunk with their blood.<p>And thus in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-42.htm">Deuteronomy 32:42</a>, a similar figure is used respecting arrows, the instruments also of war and vengeance:<p>I will make mine arrows drunk with blood;<p>And my sword shall devour flesh.<p>A similar figure is often used in Oriental writers, where the sword is represented as glutted, satiated, or made drunk with blood (see Rosenmuller on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-42.htm">Deuteronomy 32:42</a>). Thus Bohaddinus, in the lift of Saladin, in describing a battle in which there was a great slaughter, says, 'The swords drank of their blood until they were intoxicated.' The idea here is, however, not that the sword of the Lord was made drunk with blood in heaven, but that it was intoxicated, or made furious with wrath; it was excited as an intoxicated man is who is under ungovernable passions; it was in heaven that the wrath commenced, and the sword of divine justice rushed forth as if intoxicated, to destroy all before it. There are few figures, even in Isaiah, that are more bold than this.<p>It shall come down upon Idumea - (see the Analysis of the chapter for the situation of Idumea, and for the causes why it was to be devoted to destruction).<p>Upon the people of my curse - The people devoted to destruction. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. sword&#8212;(Jer 46:10).

Petra or Selah, called Joktheel (2Ki 14:7), was capital of South Edom (see on [754]Isa 16:1). David subjugated Edom (2Sa 8:13, 14). Under Jehoram they regained independence (2Ch 21:8). Under Amaziah they were again subdued, and Selah taken (2Ki 14:7). When Judah was captive in Babylon, Edom, in every way, insulted over her fallen mistress, killed many of those Jews whom the Chaldeans had left, and hence was held guilty of fratricide by God (Esau, their ancestor, having been brother to Jacob): this was the cause of the denunciations of the prophets against Edom (Isa 63:1, &c.; Jer 49:7; Eze 25:12-14; 35:3-15; Joe 3:19; Am 1:11, 12; Ob 8, 10, 12-18; Mal 1:3,4).

That is, the sword of the Lord, as it is called in the next verse <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a>, and it is he that is speaking; it designs the vengeance of the Lord, the punishment he will inflict on the wicked, said to be "bathed in heaven", because determined and prepared there; the allusion may be to the bathing of swords in some sort of liquor, to harden or brighten them, and so fit them for use. Kimchi renders it, "my sword" which is "in heaven shall be bathed", that is, in the blood of the slain; "heaven" may denote the whole Roman Papal jurisdiction, as it does the whole Roman Pagan empire in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a> and may design the principal men in it, those that are in the highest places and offices, in whom the sword of the Lord shall be first drenched, and be as it were satiated and inebriated with the blood of them: <p>behold, it shall come down upon Idumea; with great weight, force, and vengeance, having a commission from heaven to execute. Idumea is here particularly mentioned, because the Edomites were implacable enemies to the Jews, and so are here put for all the enemies of God's church and people, all the antichristian states, particularly Rome, which the Jews, as Jerom observes, understand by Edom or Idumea here: <p>upon the people of my curse to judgment; a very descriptive character of the Papists, the people of God's curse, and righteously so; those who have anathematized his people, and cursed them with bell, book, and candle, are anathematized by him, devoted to destruction, and doomed to be accursed, sentenced to ruin, and on whom judgment shall pass, and shall be executed; they shall hear, "go, ye cursed", both here and hereafter, at the fall of Babylon, and at the general judgment.

Some suppose a reference to the old" war in heaven," when the sword of Divine justice was drawn against the devil and his angels. Others regard the sword now to be used against the Idumeans as first, in heaven, "made drunken" with the Divine anger. <span class="cmt_word">It shall come down upon Idumea</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-1.htm">Isaiah 63:1-6</a>). The Edomites first showed themselves enemies of Israel when they refused to allow the Israelites, under Moses, "a passage through their border" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>). David subdued them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9.htm">2 Samuel 9</a>:14); but they revolted from Jehoram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-8.htm">2 Chronicles 21:8-10</a>), and were thenceforward among the most bitter adversaries of the southern kingdom. They "smote Judah" in the reign of Ahaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-17.htm">2 Chronicles 28:17</a>), and were always ready to "shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Ezekiel 35:5</a>). Amos speaks of them very much in the same tone as Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11, 12</a>). They ultimately "filled up the measure of their iniquities" by open rejoicing when  Jerusalem was destroyed, and the people led away captive by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-21.htm">Lamentations 4:21, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-10.htm">Ezekiel 35:10-13</a>).

God had said of Edom, probably before Isaiah uttered the present prophecy, "For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof... but I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11, 12</a>). Thus Edom was under a curse. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Compare Grashof, Ueber das Schiff bei Homer und Hesiod, Gymnasial-programm 1834, p. 23ff.). The &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bc;&#x3b7; ( equals  &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;) is the cross plank which connects the two sides of the ship. A piece is cut out of this on the side towards the rudder, in which the mast is supported, being also let into a hole in the boards of the keel (&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;) and there held fast. The mast is also prevented from falling backwards by ropes or stays carried forward to the bows (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;). On landing, the mast is laid back into a hollow place in the bottom of the ship (&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;). If the stays are not drawn tight, the mast may easily fall backwards, and so slip not only out of the &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bc;&#x3b7; but out of the &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7; also. This is the meaning of the words &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1503;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1501;. It would be better to understand ke&#772;n as referring to the &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7; than to the &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;. The latter has no "hole," but only a notch, i.e., a semicircular piece cut out, and serves as a support to the mast; the former, on the contrary, has the mast inserted into it, and serves as a ke&#772;n, i.e., a basis, theca, loculamentum. Vitringa observes (though without knowing the difference between &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bc;&#x3b7; and &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;): "Oportet accedere funes, qui thecam firment, h. e. qui malum sustinentes thecae succurrant, qui quod theca sola per se praestare nequit absque funibus cum ea veluti concurrentes efficiant."<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-23.htm">Isaiah 33:23</a>Now indeed it was apparently very different from this. It was not Assyria, but Jerusalem, that was like a ship about to be wrecked; but when that which had just been predicted should be fulfilled, Jerusalem, at present so powerless and sinful, would be entirely changed. "Thy ropes hang loose; they do not hold fast the support of thy mast; they do not hold the flag extended: then is booty of plunder divided in abundance; even lame men share the prey. And not an inhabitant will say, I am weak: the people settled there have their sins forgiven." Nearly every commentator (even Luzzatto) has taken <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-23.htm">Isaiah 33:23</a> as addressed to Assyria, which, like a proud vessel of war, would cross the encircling river by which Jerusalem was surrounded. But Drechsler has very properly given up this view. The address itself, with the suffix ayikh (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26</a>), points to Jerusalem; and the reference to this gives the most appropriate sense, whilst the contrast between the now and then closes the prophecy in the most glorious manner. Jerusalem is now a badly appointed ship, dashed about by the storm, the sport of the waves. Its rigging hangs loose (Jerome, laxati sunt); it does not hold the ke&#772;n torna&#770;m fast, i.e., the support of their mast, or cross beam with a hole in it, into which the mast is slipped (the mesodme of Homer, Od. xv 289), which is sure to go to ruin along with the falling mast, if the ropes do not assist its bearing power (malum sustinentes thecae succurrant, as Vitruvius says). And so the ropes of the ship Jerusalem do not keep the ne&#772;s spread out, i.e., the &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; of the ship, whether we understand by it a flag or a sail, with a device worked upon it (see Winer, R.W. s. v. Schiffe). And this is the case with Jerusalem now; but then ('a&#770;z) it will be entirely different. Asshur is wrecked, and Jerusalem enriches itself, without employing any weapons, from the wealth of the Assyrian camp. It was with a prediction of this spoiling of Asshur that the prophet commenced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-1.htm">Isaiah 33:1</a>; so that the address finishes as it began. But the closing words of the prophet are, that the people of Jerusalem are now strong in God, and are &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1</a>), lifted up, taken away from their guilt. A people humbled by punishment, penitent, and therefore pardoned, would then dwell in Jerusalem. The strength of Israel, and all its salvation, rest upon the forgiveness of its sins. </body></html>
