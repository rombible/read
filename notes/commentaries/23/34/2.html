In which words he implies, either that such vast numbers would be slain, that the survivers would not be able to find time or place to bury them, or that they should be held in such contempt and abhorrence that none would be inclined to do them that office: <span class="ital">and the mountains </span>— About Jerusalem, where they are supposed to be gathered to fight against her, like the Assyrians; <span class="ital">shall be melted with their blood </span>— Shall be covered with their blood, which shall flow down abundantly from them with great force, and dissolve, and carry down with it a part of the soil of the mountains, as great showers of rain frequently do. This sentence upon the nations, which thus exhibits a kind of general judgment, to be executed upon the enemies of God and his people, by the sword of God, is sufficient to strike terror into every hearer.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/34.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>34:1-8 Here is a prophecy of the wars of the Lord, all which are both righteous and successful. All nations are concerned. And as they have all had the benefit of his patience, so all must expect to feel his resentment. The description of bloodshed suggests tremendous ideas of the Divine judgments. Idumea here denotes the nations at enmity with the church; also the kingdom of antichrist. Our thoughts cannot reach the horrors of that awful season, to those found opposing the church of Christ. There is a time fixed in the Divine counsels for the deliverance of the church, and the destruction of her enemies. We must patiently wait till then, and judge nothing before the time. Through Christ, mercy is exercised to every believer, consistently with justice, and his name is glorified.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the indignation of the Lord - Yahweh is about to express his wrath against all the nations which are opposed to his people.<p>He hath utterly destroyed them - In his purpose, or intention.

The prophet passes over here into the tone of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/48-1.htm">Psalm 48:1-14</a> (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/48-13.htm">Psalm 48:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-14.htm">Psalm 48:14</a>). <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1-11</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/48-1.htm">Psalm 48:1-14</a> probably belong to the time of Jehoshaphat; but they are equally applicable to the deliverance of Jerusalem in the time of Hezekiah. "Look upon Zion, the castle of our festal meeting. Thine eyes will see Jerusalem, a pleasant place, a tent that does not wander about, whose pegs are never drawn, and none of whose cords are ever broken." Jerusalem stands there unconquered and inviolable, the fortress where the congregation of the whole land celebrates its feasts, a place full of good cheer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-18.htm">Isaiah 32:18</a>), in which everything is now arranged for a continuance. Jerusalem has come out of tribulation stronger than ever - not a nomadic wandering tent (tsa&#770;&#8219;am, a nomad word, to wander, lit., to pack up  equals  ta&#770;&#8219;an in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-17.htm">Genesis 45:17</a>), but one set up for a permanent dwelling. </body></html>
