What dismal changes sin can make! It turns a fruitful land into barrenness, a crowded city into a wilderness. Let us compare all we discover in the book of the Lord, with the dealings of providence around us, that we may be more diligent in seeking the kingdom of God and his righteousness. What the mouth of the Lord has commanded, his Spirit will perform. And let us observe how the evidences of the truth continually increase, as one prophecy after another is fulfilled, until these awful scenes bring in more happy days. As Israel was a figure of the Christian church, so the Edomites, their bitter enemies, represent the enemies of the kingdom of Christ. God's Jerusalem may be laid in ruins for a time, but the enemies of the church shall be desolate for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But the cormorant - This and the following verses contain a description of the desolations of Edom in language remarkably similar to that employed in the account of the destruction of Babylon <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-23.htm">Isaiah 14:23</a>. The word here translated 'cormorant' (&#1511;&#1488;&#1514;  qa&#770;'ath), occurs in this place and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-14.htm">Zephaniah 2:14</a>, where it is rendered 'cormorant,' and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-18.htm">Leviticus 11:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-17.htm">Deuteronomy 14:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-6.htm">Psalm 102:6</a>, where it is rendered 'pelican.' Bochart supposes it is the ardea stellaris, or bitourn, which frequents watery places in deserts, and makes a horrible noise. The pelican is a sea-fowl, and cannot be intended here. The cormorant or water raven is a large fowl of the pelican kind, which occupies the cliffs by the sea, feeds on fish, and which is extremely voracious, and which is the emblem of a glutton. It is not certain what fowl is intended here, but the word properly denotes a water-fowl, and evidently refers to some bird that inhabits desolate places.<p>And the bittern shall possess it - For a description of the bittern, see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-23.htm">Isaiah 14:23</a>.<p>The owl also and the raven - Well known birds that occupy deserts, and old ruins of houses or towns. The image here is that of desolation and ruin; and the sense is, that the land would be reduced to a waste that would not be inhabited by man, but would be given up to wild animals. How well this agrees with Edom, may be seen in the Travels of Burckhardt, Seetsen, and others. In regard to the fact that the cormorant (&#1511;&#1488;&#1514;  qa&#770;'ath) should be found there, it may be proper to introduce a remark of Burckhardt, who seems to have had no reference to this prophecy. 'The bird katta,' says he, 'is met with in immense numbers. They fly in such large flocks that the boys often kill two or three of them at a time, merely by throwing a stick among them.' So also in regard to the fact that the owl and the raven shall dwell there, the following statements are made by travelers: Captain Mangles relates thatwhile he and his fellow-travelers were examining the ruins and contemplating the sublime scenery of Petra, 'the screaming of the eagles, hawks, and owls, which were soaring above their heads in considerable numbers, seemingly annoyed at anyone approaching their lonely habitation, added much to the singularity of the scene.' So says Burckhardt: 'The fields of Tafyle (situated in the immediate vicinity of Edom) are frequented by an immense number of crows.'<p>And he shall stretch out upon it - This is an illusion to the fact that an architect uses a line, which is employed to lay out his work (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-17.htm">Isaiah 28:17</a>).<p>The line of confusion - A similar expression occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-13.htm">2 Kings 21:13</a> : 'I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab;' that is, I will apply the same measure and rule of destruction to Jerusalem that has been applied to Samaria. So Edom would be marked out for desolation. It was the work which God had laid out, and which he intended to perform.<p>And the stones of emptiness - Probably the plummet which the architect commonly employed with his line (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-17.htm">Isaiah 28:17</a>). It is a fact, however, that Edom is at present an extended waste of stones and barren rocks. 'We had before us an immense expanse of dreary country, entirely covered with black flints, with here and there some hilly chain rising from the plain.'

"For my sword has become intoxicated in the heaven; behold, it comes down upon Edom, and upon the people of my ban to judgment. The sword of Jehovah fills itself with blood, is fattened with fat, with blood of lambs and he-goats, with kidney-fat of rams; for Jehovah has a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom. And buffaloes fall with them, and bullocks together with bulls; and their land become intoxicated with blood, and their dust fattened with fat." Just as in chapter 63 Jehovah is represented as a treader of the wine-press, and the nations as the grapes; so here He is represented as offering sacrifice, and the nations as the animals offered (zebhach: cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-10.htm">Jeremiah 46:10</a>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17</a>.: all three passages founded upon this). Jehovah does not appear here in person as judge, as He does there, but His sword appears; just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>, the "sword which turned every way" is mentioned as an independent power standing by the side of the cherub. The sword is His executioner, which has no sooner drunk deeply of wrath in heaven, i.e., in the immediate sphere of the Deity (rivvetha&#770;h, an intensive form of the kal, like pitte&#772;a&#774;ch, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-8.htm">Isaiah 48:8</a>; Ewald, 120, d), than it comes down in wild intoxication upon Edom, the people of the ban of Jehovah, i.e., the people upon whom He has laid the ban, and there, as His instrument of punishment, fills itself with blood, and fattens itself with fat. &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; is the hothpaal  equals  &#1492;&#1514;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, with the &#1514; of the preformative syllable assimilated (compare &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16</a>, and &#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-14.htm">Isaiah 14:14</a>). The penultimate has the tone, the na&#770;h being treated as in the plural forms of the future. The dropping of the dagesh in the &#1513;&#1473; eht ni hse is connected with this. The reading &#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1489;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a>, is an error that has been handed down in modern copies (in opposition to both codices and ancient editions); for &#1495;&#1500;&#1489; (primary form, chilb) is the only form met with in the Old Testament. The lambs, he-goats, and rams, represent the Edomitish nation, which is compared to these smaller sacrificial animals. Edom and Bozrah are also placed side by side in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-1.htm">Isaiah 63:1</a>. The latter was one of the chief cities of the Edomites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-33.htm">Genesis 36:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-12.htm">Amos 1:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-13.htm">Jeremiah 49:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>) - not the Bozrah in Auranitis (Haura&#770;n), however, which is well known in church history, but Bozrah in the mountains of Edom, upon the same site as the village of Buzaire (i.e., Minor Bozrah), which is still surrounded by its ruins. In contrast with the three names of the smaller animals in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a>, the three names of oxen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-7.htm">Isaiah 34:7</a> represent the lords of Edom. They also will fall, smitten by the sword (ya&#770;redu&#772;: cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-27.htm">Jeremiah 50:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-40.htm">Jeremiah 51:40</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-15.htm">Jeremiah 48:15</a>). The feast of the sword is so abundant, that even the earth and the dust of the land of Edom are satiated with blood and fat. </body></html>
