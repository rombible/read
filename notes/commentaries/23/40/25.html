He that is so poor, that he has scarcely a sacrifice to offer, yet will not be without a god of his own. They spared no cost upon their idols; we grudge what is spent in the service of our God. To prove the greatness of God, the prophet appeals to all ages and nations. Those who are ignorant of this, are willingly ignorant. God has the command of all creatures, and of all created things. The prophet directs us to use our reason as well as our senses; to consider who created the hosts of heaven, and to pay our homage to Him. Not one fails to fulfil his will. And let us not forget, that He spake all the promises, and engaged to perform them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To whom then will ye liken me? - (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18</a>) The prophet having thus set forth the majesty and glory of God, asks now with great emphasis, what could be an adequate and proper representation of such a God. And if God was such a Being, how great was the folly of idolatry, and how vain all their confidence in the gods which their own hands had made. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25.

This is a summary, to conclude the section (vers. 19-24), as ver. 18 concludes the preceding one. If God is paramount over idols (vers. 19, 20) and over nature (ver. 22) and over humanity (vers. 23, 24), to whom can he be likened?

Isaiah's special designation of God, at once pregnant and almost peculiar (see the comment on ch. 1:4), is "the Holy One of Israel." This is, here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>, abbreviated. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/40.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Least of all can an idol bear comparison with Him. "The idol, when the smith has cast it, the melter plates it with gold, and melteth silver chains for it." The object (happesel, the idol), which is here placed first as the theme in the accusative (lit. the image hewn out), denotes in this instance an idol generally. &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; is as comprehensive as faber. &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489; &#1512;&#1511;&#1468;&#1506; signifies here to cover over with a &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; &#1512;&#1511;&#1468;&#1506; (lamina&#770; auri), the verb being used in a denominative sense, and not in its primary meaning. As we must assume, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-20.htm">Isaiah 40:20</a>, that the prophet intends to carry us into the midst of the process of manufacturing the idol, the paratactic expression is to be pointed as above, viz., "after the (a) smith has cast it (compare Arab. nasik, a piece of cast metal), the (a) melter (goldsmith) covers it with gold plate;" and tso&#772;re&#772;ph, which is palindromically repeated, according to Isaiah's custom, is not the third pers. poel (on the poel of strong stems, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-15.htm">Job 9:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-10.htm">Psalm 109:10</a>), but a participle, equivalent to &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1510;&#1493;&#1512;&#1507; (as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-8.htm">Isaiah 29:8</a>, which see; and also, according to the accents, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-5.htm">Isaiah 33:5</a>), "and he melteth chains of silver," viz., to fasten the image. </body></html>
