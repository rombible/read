Let them remember they took the names Jacob and Israel, from one who found God faithful to him in all his straits. And they bore these names as a people in covenant with Him. Many foolish frets, and foolish fears, would vanish before inquiry into the causes. It is bad to have evil thoughts rise in our minds, but worse to turn them into evil words. What they had known, and had heard, was sufficient to silence all these fears and distrusts. Where God had begun the work of grace, he will perfect it. He will help those who, in humble dependence on him, help themselves. As the day, so shall the strength be. In the strength of Divine grace their souls shall ascend above the world. They shall run the way of God's commandments cheerfully. Let us watch against unbelief, pride, and self-confidence. If we go forth in our own strength, we shall faint, and utterly fall; but having our hearts and our hopes in heaven, we shall be carried above all difficulties, and be enabled to lay hold of the prize of our high calling in Christ Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hast thou not known? - This is the language of the prophet reproving them for complaining of being forsaken and assuring them that God was faithful to his promises. This argument of the prophet, which continues to the close of the chapter, comprises the main scope of the chapter, which is to induce them to put confidence in God, and to believe that he was able and willing to deliver them. The phrase, 'Hast thou not known? refers to the fact that the Jewish people had had an abundant opportunity of learning, in their history, and from their fathers, the true character of God, and his entire ability to save them. No people had had so much light on this subject, and now that they were in trial, they ought to recall their former knowledge of his character, and remember his dealings of faithfulness with them and their fathers. It is well for the people of God in times of calamity and trial to recall to their recollection his former dealings with his church. That history will furnish abundant sources of consolation, and abundant assurances that their interests are safe in his hands.<p>Hast thou not heard? - From the traditions of the fathers; the instruction which you have received from ancient times. A large part of the knowledge of the Jews was traditionary; and these attributes of God, as a faithful God, had, no doubt, constituted an important part of the knowledge which had thus been communicated to them.<p>The everlasting God - The God who has existed from eternity, unlike the idols of the pagan. If he was from eternity, he would be unchangeable, and his purposes could not fail.<p>The Creator of the ends of the earth - The phrase, 'the ends of the earth,' means the same as the earth itself. The earth is sometimes spoken of as a vast plain having limits or boundaries (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a>). It is probable that this was the prevailing idea among the ancients (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-6.htm">Psalm 19:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-27.htm">Psalm 22:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-10.htm">Psalm 48:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-5.htm">Psalm 65:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/67-7.htm">Psalm 67:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-3.htm">Psalm 98:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-6.htm">Isaiah 43:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-22.htm">Isaiah 45:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-10.htm">Isaiah 52:10</a>). The argument here is, that he who has formed the earth could not be exhausted or weary in so small a work as that of protecting his people.<p>Fainteth not - Is not fatigued or exhausted. That God, who has formed and sustained all things, is not exhausted in his powers, but is able still to defend and guard his people.<p>There is no searching of his understanding - The God who made all things must be infinitely wise. There is proof of boundless skill in the works of his hands, and it is impossible for finite mind fully and adequately to search out all the proofs of his wisdom and skill. Man can see only a part - a small part, while the vast ocean, the boundless deep of his wisdom, lies still unexplored. This thought is beautifully expressed by Zophar in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7-9</a> :<p>Canst thou by searching find out God?<p>Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?<p>It is as high as heaven;<p>What canst thou do?<p>Deeper than hell;<p>What canst thou know:<p>The measure thereof is longer than the earth,<p>And broader than the sea.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. known&#8212;by thine own observation and reading of Scripture.<p>heard&#8212;from tradition of the fathers.<p>everlasting, &c.&#8212;These attributes of Jehovah ought to inspire His afflicted people with confidence.<p>no searching of his understanding&#8212;therefore thy cause cannot, as thou sayest, escape His notice; though much in His ways is unsearchable, He cannot err (Job 11:7-9). He is never "faint" or "weary" with having the countless wants of His people ever before Him to attend to.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/40.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Of the ends of the earth; </span> of all the earth, and the inhabitants thereof, from one end to another.

The participles which follow are predicates of the subject, which filled the consciousness of the prophet as well as that of every believer. "He who is enthroned above the vault of the earth, and its inhabitants resemble grasshoppers; who has spread out the heavens like gauze, and stretched them out like a tent-roof to dwell in." He, the manifested and yet unknown, is He who has for His throne the circle of the heavens (chu&#772;g sha&#770;mayim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-14.htm">Job 22:14</a>), which arches over the earth, and to whom from His inaccessible height men appear as diminutive as grasshoppers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-33.htm">Numbers 13:33</a>); He who has spread out the blue sky like a thin transparent garment (do&#772;q, a thin fabric, like daq, fine dust, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-15.htm">Isaiah 40:15</a>), and stretched it out above the earth like a tent for dwelling in ('o&#772;hel<p>(Note: The noun 'o&#772;hel is derived from the root &#1488;&#1500;, from which come Arab.

The participle brings to view the actions and circumstances of all times.
