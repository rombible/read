By others it is taken as an intentional repetition, emphasising the previous assertion, after the manner of Hebrew poetry. The latter view seems to have most in its favour.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/64.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/64-3.htm" title="When you did terrible things which we looked not for, you came down, the mountains flowed down at your presence....">Isaiah 64:3-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">When thou didst terrible things — </span>This may relate to what he did first in Egypt, and afterward in the wilderness; <span class="ital">which we looked not for</span> — Such things as we could not have expected; <span class="ital">the mountains flowed down</span> — See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm" title="And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended on it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.">Exodus 19:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-22.htm" title="For a fire is kindled in my anger, and shall burn to the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.">Deuteronomy 32:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-7.htm" title="Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.">Psalm 18:7</a>, with the notes. But Lowth proposes another interpretation, which he thinks agrees better with what follows, namely, <span class="ital">When thou shalt do terrible and unexpected things, when thou shalt come down, </span>(and visibly interpose for the deliverance of thy people,) <span class="ital">the mountains shall melt at thy presence. For since the beginning of the world, </span>&c. — “The methods of thy dispensations, whereby thou wilt fulfil thy promises made to thy people, are beyond any thing we can think or conceive.” Bishop Lowth translates this verse, more agreeably both to the Hebrew and the LXX., thus: For “never have men heard, nor perceived, by the ear; nor hath eye seen a God besides thee, who doeth such things for those, that trust in him.” Some of the Jewish doctors have understood this passage of the blessings belonging to the days of the Messiah; and to them the apostle applies it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-9.htm" title="But as it is written, Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for them that love him.">1 Corinthians 2:9</a>. Others extend it to the glories of the world to come. Of both these it may be truly said, that <span class="ital">from the beginning of the world </span>men have not, either by <span class="ital">hearing </span>or <span class="ital">seeing; </span>or, as the apostle adds, by any reasonings or conceptions of their own minds, come to the full knowledge of them. None have seen or heard, or can understand, but God himself; and so far as he has been, and is, pleased to reveal it by his Spirit, what the provision is, which is made for the present and future felicity of holy souls; or, as our translation here expresses it, of those that <span class="ital">wait for him, </span>namely, in the way of duty; that sincerely and earnestly desire, and live in the daily and ardent expectation of, the salvation he hath promised them. The apostle has it, <span class="ital">that love him; </span>to show that as none can <span class="ital">wait </span>for him who do not <span class="ital">love </span>him, so all that <span class="ital">love </span>him will <span class="ital">wait </span>for him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/64.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>64:1-5 They desire that God would manifest himself to them and for them, so that all may see it. This is applicable to the second coming of Christ, when the Lord himself shall descend from heaven. They plead what God had used to do, and had declared his gracious purpose to do, for his people. They need not fear being disappointed of it, for it is sure; or disappointed in it, for it is sufficient. The happiness of his people is bound up in what God has designed for them, and is preparing for them, and preparing them for; what he has done or will do. Can we believe this, and then think any thing too great to expect from his truth, power, and love? It is spiritual and cannot be comprehended by human understanding. It is ever ready. See what communion there is between a gracious God and a gracious soul. We must make conscience of doing our duty in every thing the Lord our God requires. Thou meetest him; this speaks his freeness and forwardness in doing them good. Though God has been angry with us for our sins, and justly, yet his anger has soon ended; but in his favour is life, which goes on and continues, and on that we depend for our salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/64.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When thou didst terrible things - In delivering the people from Egypt, and in conducting them to the promised land.<p>Which we looked not for - Which we had never before witnessed, and which we had no right to expect.<p>Thou camest down - As on Mount Sinai.<p>The mountains flowed down - (See the notes above).

It is possible it may allude to those mountains that do cast forth sulphurous matter, running down into the valleys and sea, like melted streams of fire.

Thou, O Jehovah, art our Father; our Redeemer is from olden time Thy name." Jehovah is Israel's Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>). His creative might, and the gracious counsels of His love, have called it into being: &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; has not yet the deep and unrestricted sense of the New Testament "Our Father." The second k&#305;&#772; introduces the reason for this confession that Jehovah was Israel's Father, and could therefore look for paternal care and help from Him alone. Even the dearest and most honourable men, the forefathers of the nation, could not help it. Abraham and Jacob-Israel had been taken away from this world, and were unable to interfere on their own account in the history of their people. &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; and &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; suggest the idea of participating notice and regard, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-9.htm">Deuteronomy 33:9</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-10.htm">Ruth 2:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-19.htm">Ruth 2:19</a>. &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; has the vowel a&#770; (pausal for a, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-3.htm">Isaiah 56:3</a>) in the place of e&#772;, to rhyme with &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (see Ges. 60, Anm. 2).
