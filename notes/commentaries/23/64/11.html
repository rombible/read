Sin is that abominable thing which the Lord hates. Our deeds, whatever they may seem to be, if we think to merit by them at God's hand, are as rags, and will not cover us; filthy rags, and will but defile us. Even our few good works in which there is real excellence, as fruits of the Spirit, are so defective and defiled as done by us, that they need to be washed in the fountain open for sin and uncleanness. It bodes ill when prayer is kept back. To pray, is by faith to take hold of the promises the Lord has made of his good-will to us, and to plead them; to take hold of him, earnestly begging him not to leave us; or soliciting his return. They brought their troubles upon themselves by their own folly. Sinners are blasted, and then carried away, by the wind of their own iniquity; it withers and then ruins them. When they made themselves as an unclean thing, no wonder that God loathed them. Foolish and careless as we are, poor and despised, yet still Thou art our Father. It is the wrath of a Father we are under, who will be reconciled; and the relief our case requires is expected only from him. They refer themselves to God. They do not say, Lord, rebuke us not, for that may be necessary; but, Not in thy displeasure. They state their lamentable condition. See what ruin sin brings upon a people; and an outward profession of holiness will be no defence against it. God's people presume not to tell him what he shall say, but their prayer is, Speak for the comfort and relief of thy people. How few call upon the Lord with their whole hearts, or stir themselves to lay hold upon him! God may delay for a time to answer our prayers, but he will, in the end, answer those who call on his name and hope in his mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/64.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Our holy and our beautiful house - The temple.

The original word more properly means glorious.<p>Where our fathers praised thee - Few attachments become stronger than that which is formed for a place of worship where our ancestors have long been engaged in the service of God.

The reference is to their temples, their homes, their city - to all that was dear to them in their native land. It would be difficult to find a passage anywhere in the Bible - or out of it - that equals this for tenderness and true pathos. They were an exiled people; long suffering in a distant land with the reflection that their homes were in ruins; their splendid temple long since fired and lying in desolation; the rank grass growing in their streets, and their whole country overrun with wild beasts, and with a rank and unsubdued vegetation. To that land they longed to return, and here with the deepest emotion they plead with God in behalf of their desolate country. The sentiment here is, that we should go to God with deep emotion when his church is prostrate, and that then is the time when we should use the most tender pleadings, and when our hearts should be melted within us. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/64.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. house&#8212;the temple.<p>beautiful&#8212;includes the idea of glorious (Mr 13:1; Ac 3:2).<p>burned&#8212;(Ps 74:7; La 2:7; 2Ch 36:19).

The reference must apparently be to the first Temple and its destruction by the Chaldæans. The expression, and indeed the whole tone of the passage, suggest an event not quite recent; it is not the present generation, but their fathers who praised God in the “holy and beautiful house.” The question then comes to be whether this could have been said after the erection of Zerubbabel’s Temple. In spite of the tendency to hyperbolical language which marks the prayer, and the painful contrast between the magnificence of the first Temple and the poverty of the second, it is difficult to think that the author should absolutely ignore the existence of the sanctuary if it had been restored.

This is the true meaning. The exiles have the tenderest and most vivid remembrance of the holiness and the beauty (or glory) of that edifice, which had formed the centre of the national life for above four centuries, and had been a marvel of richness and magnificence. Many of them had seen it with their own eyes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-12.htm">Ezra 3:12</a>), and could never forget its splendours. <span class="cmt_word">Where our fathers praised thee.</span> Though in the later times of the Captivity there were still some of the exiles who had seen the temple, and probably worshipped in it, yet with the great majority it was otherwise.

Our pleasant things; or, <span class="accented">our delectable things - as</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9</a>; the courts, gardens, outbuildings of the temple, are probably meant. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/64.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The people who ask the question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-5.htm">Isaiah 64:5</a> do not regard themselves as worthy of redemption, as their self-righteousness has been so thoroughly put to shame. "We all became like the unclean thing, and all our virtues like a garment soiled with blood; and we all faded away together like the leaves; and our iniquities, like the storm they carried us away." The whole nation is like one whom the law pronounces unclean, like a leper, who has to cry "ta&#770;me&#772;, ta&#770;me&#772; "as he goes along, that men may get out of his way (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a>). Doing right in all its manifold forms (tseda&#770;qo&#772;th, like <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>, used elsewhere of the manifestations of divine righteousness), which once made Israel well-pleasing to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>), has disappeared and become like a garment stained with menstruous discharge (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-17.htm">Ezekiel 36:17</a>); (lxx &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  equals  da&#770;va&#770;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-22.htm">Isaiah 30:22</a>; nidda&#770;h, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-17.htm">Lamentations 1:17</a>; teme&#772;'a&#770;h, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-33.htm">Leviticus 15:33</a>). &#8219;Idd&#305;&#772;m (used thus in the plural in the Talmud also) signifies the monthly period (menstrua). In the third figure, that of fading falling foliage, the form vanna&#770;bhel is not kal ( equals  vannibbo&#772;l or vannibbal; Ewald, 232, b), which would be an impossibility according to the laws of inflexion; still less is it niphal  equals  vanninna&#770;bhel (which Kimchi suggests as an alternative); but certainly a hiphil. It is not, however, from na&#770;bhe&#772;l  equals  vannabbel, "with the reduplication dropped to express the idea of something gradual," as Bttcher proposes (a new and arbitrary explanation in the place of one founded upon the simple laws of inflexion), but either from ba&#770;lal (compare the remarks on bel&#305;&#772;l in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-24.htm">Isaiah 30:24</a>, which hardly signifies "ripe barley" however), after the form &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1490;&#1500; (from &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;) &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1505;&#1498; (from &#1505;&#1499;&#1498;), or from bu&#772;l, after the form &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1501;, etc. In any case, therefore, it is a metaplastic formation, whether from ba&#770;lal or bu&#772;l  equals  na&#770;bhe&#772;l, like &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; (in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-3.htm">1 Chronicles 20:3</a>, after the form &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;, from &#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1493;&#1512;  equals  &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, or after the form &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;, from &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1512;  equals  &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; (compare the rabbinical explanation of the name of the month Bul from the falling of the leaves, in Buxtorf, Lex. talm. col. 271). The hiphil &#1492;&#1489;&#1500; or &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1500; is to be compared to &#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, to stream out red ( equals  to be red); &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;, to make an extension ( equals  to be long); &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, to strike root ( equals  to root), etc., and signifies literally to produce a fading ( equals  to fade away). In the fourth figure, &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (as it is also written in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a> according to correct codices) is a defective plural (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-7.htm">Jeremiah 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-18.htm">Ezekiel 28:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-13.htm">Daniel 9:13</a>) for the more usual &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-12.htm">Isaiah 59:12</a>). &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; is the usual term applied to sin regarded as guilt, which produces punishment of itself. The people were robbed by their sins of all vital strength and energy, like dry leaves, which the guilt and punishment springing from sin carried off as a very easy prey. </body></html>
