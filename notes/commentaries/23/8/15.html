Possibly for the prophet and his disciples, each word had a distinct ethical significance, which we can only partially recover. Looking to the figure implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm" title="And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.">Isaiah 8:14</a>, they seem to describe the several stages of the capture of the animal for whom the trap has been laid. It first stumbles, then falls into the pit, and breaks its limbs, then is fastened in the trap, and is powerless to escape.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:9-16 The prophet challenges the enemies of the Jews. Their efforts would be vain, and themselves broken to pieces. It concerns us, in time of trouble, to watch against all such fears as put us upon crooked courses for our own security. The believing fear of God preserves against the disquieting fear of man. If we thought rightly of the greatness and glory of God, we should see all the power of our enemies restrained. The Lord, who will be a Sanctuary to those who trust in him, will be a Stone of stumbling, and a Rock of offence, to those who make the creature their fear and their hope. If the things of God be an offence to us, they will undo us. The apostle quotes this as to all who persisted in unbelief of the gospel of Christ, 1Pe 2:8. The crucified Emmanuel, who was and is a Stumbling-stone and Rock of offence to unbelieving Jews, is no less so to thousands who are called Christians. The preaching of the cross is foolishness in their esteem; his doctrines and precepts offend them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And many among them - Many by the invasion under the Assyrian.

We may see this from the fact, that what was almost a silent prayer is changed at once into the jubilate of holy defiance. "Exasperate yourselves, O nations, and go to pieces; and see it, all who are far off in the earth! Gird yourselves, and go to pieces; gird yourselves, and go to pieces! Consult counsel, and it comes to nought; speak the word, and it is not realized: for with us is God." The second imperatives in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-9.htm">Isaiah 8:9</a> are threatening words of authority, having a future signification, which change into futures in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19</a> (Ges. 130, 2): Go on exasperating yourselves &#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;( with the tone upon the penultimate, and therefore not the pual of &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, consociari, which is the rendering adopted in the Targum, but the kal of &#1512;&#1506;&#1506;, malum esse; not vociferari, for which &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, a different verb from the same root, is commonly employed), go on arming; ye will nevertheless fall to pieces (Cho&#772;ttu, from Cha&#770;thath, related to Ca&#770;thath, Confringi, Consternari). The prophet classes together all the nations that are warring against the people of God, pronounces upon them the sentence of destruction, and calls upon all distant lands to hear this ultimate fate of the kingdom of the world, i.e., of the imperial power. The world-kingdom must be wrecked on the land of Immanuel; "for with us," as the watchword of believers runs, pointing to the person of the Savour, "with us is God." </body></html>
