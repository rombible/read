Their efforts would be vain, and themselves broken to pieces. It concerns us, in time of trouble, to watch against all such fears as put us upon crooked courses for our own security. The believing fear of God preserves against the disquieting fear of man. If we thought rightly of the greatness and glory of God, we should see all the power of our enemies restrained. The Lord, who will be a Sanctuary to those who trust in him, will be a Stone of stumbling, and a Rock of offence, to those who make the creature their fear and their hope. If the things of God be an offence to us, they will undo us. The apostle quotes this as to all who persisted in unbelief of the gospel of Christ, 1Pe 2:8. The crucified Emmanuel, who was and is a Stumbling-stone and Rock of offence to unbelieving Jews, is no less so to thousands who are called Christians. The preaching of the cross is foolishness in their esteem; his doctrines and precepts offend them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bind up - This expression is one that is applicable to a volume, or roll of writing. Thus far the prophet seems to have had the roll opened, which is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1</a>. Now the prophecy is complete, and he directs to bind it up, or close it. Perhaps, also, it is implied that it would be useless any further to address a rebellious and headstrong people. He had delivered his message, but they disregarded it.<p>The testimony - The message; especially that of which Uriah and Zechariah had been called to bear witness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-2.htm">Isaiah 8:2</a>. Any message from God is, however, sometimes called a testimony, as being that to which a prophet bears witness; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-12.htm">2 Kings 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-45.htm">Deuteronomy 4:45</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-17.htm">Deuteronomy 6:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-20.htm">Deuteronomy 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-3.htm">1 Kings 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-34.htm">Nehemiah 9:34</a>.<p>Seal - Books were made in the form of rolls, and were often sealed when completed - as we seal a letter. The mode of sealing them was not by wax only, but by uniting them by any adhesive matter, as paste, or glue. Wax in warm climates would be generally rendered useless by the heat. The meaning here is, to secure, to close up - perhaps by passing a cord or string around the volume, and making it secure, denoting that it was finished; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-26.htm">Daniel 8:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a>.<p>The law - The communication or command which he had delivered, and which, being given by inspiration, had now the force of law.<p>Among my disciples - Most of the Jewish commentators suppose that the volume, when completed by a prophet, was given for safe keeping to his disciples, or to some employed to preserve it securely. The word disciples means those who are taught, and here means those who were taught by the prophet; perhaps the pious and holy part of the people who would listen to his instructions. The Chaldee translates this verse, 'O prophet, preserve the testimony, lest ye testify to those who will not obey; seal and hide the law, because they will not learn it.' <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. Bind up &#8230; seal&#8212;What Isaiah had before briefly noted by inscribing Maher-shalal-hash-baz in a tablet, fixed up in some public place, he afterwards wrote out more in detail in a parchment roll (Isa 30:8); this he is now to seal up, not merely in order that nothing may be added to, or taken from it, as being complete, but to imply that it relates to distant events, and is therefore to be a sealed and not understood testimony (Isa 6:9, 10), except in part among God's "disciples," that is, those who "sanctify the Lord" by obedient trust (Ps 25:14). Subsequent revelations would afterwards clear up what now was dark. So the Apocalypse explains what in Daniel was left unexplained (compare Da 8:26; 12:9). "The words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end"; but Re 22:10, "Seal not the sayings of the prophecy &#8230; for the time is at hand" (compare Re 5:1, 5, 9),<p>testimony&#8212;attested by Uriah and Zechariah (Isa 8:2).<p>law&#8212;the revelation just given, having the force of a law.<p>disciples&#8212;not as Maurer, Uriah and Zechariah (compare Joh 7:17; 15:15).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> These are, by the consent of all, God’s words to the prophet. <span class="ital">By the testimony and the law or doctrine</span> (for so this word is frequently taken) he understands one and the same thing, as he doth also to wit, the word of God, and especially that which is the main scope and substance thereof, the doctrine of the Messias, which, though now professed by all the Israelites, shall be disowned by the generality of them, when the Messiah shall come. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Bind up</span> and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">seal</span> are to be understood prophetically, Declare and prophesy that it shall be bound up and sealed; as Isaiah is said to <span class="ital">make fat</span>, and to <span class="ital">blind</span>, &c. <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-10.htm" title="Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.">Isaiah 6:10</a></span>, and Jeremiah to <span class="ital">root out</span> and <span class="ital">pull down</span>, &c., <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-10.htm" title="See, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.">Jeremiah 1:10</a></span>, when they foretell these events.

Security and certainty, as things are bound up or sealed that they may not be lost. So he signifies, that although this doctrine would be lost among the body of the Israelites, yet it should be preserved among his disciples. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Secrecy, as many things are bound up or sealed that they may be hid from the eyes of others. And so he informeth them that this doctrine now was and should be hid in a great measure among all God’s people, even till the accomplishment of it; and that even when it was accomplished, it should still continue to be as a secret and mystery, known indeed to his true disciples, but hid from the body of the nation, who would not see it, and therefore should be blinded by God’s just judgment, that they should not see it, as was prophesied, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-9.htm" title="And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear you indeed, but understand not; and see you indeed, but perceive not.">Isaiah 6:9</a>,10</span>. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Both security and secrecy, signifying that it should certainly be fulfilled, yet withal kept secret from the unbelieving Jews. For why may not these two be joined in the exposition of this text, as they were in the event?

By "the testimony" is meant the word of prophecy delivered to him; particularly that evangelical part of it respecting Immanuel, who was to be born of a virgin, and would be for a sanctuary to them that believe in him, and a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, to unbelievers; so the Gospel is called the testimony of Christ, it bearing witness of his person, office, and grace, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-8.htm">2 Timothy 1:8</a> and "binding" denotes care of it, as something valuable, that it be not lost, but committed to the trust faithful men, called disciples of Christ in the next clause, in allusion to the binding up of money, or anything of value, in bundles, to be laid up and preserved, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-35.htm">Genesis 42:35</a> so the Targum, <p>"O prophet, keep the testimony:'' <p>seal the law among my disciples: the disciples of Christ, the faithful of that day, and of after times, to whom this prophecy, and the "doctrine" in it, which the word "law" signifies, even the doctrine of Christ, should be transmitted or communicated, which is meant by "sealing" of it; not hiding it from them, but signifying, that while it was a sealed book, a hidden doctrine, and delivered in parables to others, it should be made known to them, and sealed and laid up by them among their treasure, and be so esteemed of; as the Gospel, the doctrine of grace, is, by the true disciples and followers of Christ; who are such as are taught of God, have learned of the Father, who continue in the word and doctrine of Christ, love his people, take up the cross and follow him, and bring forth fruit to the glory of his heavenly Father, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-45.htm">John 6:45</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{r}</span> Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.</span><p>(r) Though all forsake me, yet you who are mine keep my word sure sealed in your hearts.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>.

Both words are here used of the contents of the revelations communicated to the prophet during these months of danger and anxiety; the former describes more particularly the evidential character of the predictions, the latter refers to the practical element in the revelation (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/7-4.htm" title="And say to him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah....">Isaiah 7:4-9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/8-11.htm" title="For the LORD spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,...">Isaiah 8:11-13</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">among my disciples</span>] i.e. those who had received the prophet’s message, and rallied round him as their spiritual guide.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">16–18</span>.

We may see this from the fact, that what was almost a silent prayer is changed at once into the jubilate of holy defiance. "Exasperate yourselves, O nations, and go to pieces; and see it, all who are far off in the earth! Gird yourselves, and go to pieces; gird yourselves, and go to pieces! Consult counsel, and it comes to nought; speak the word, and it is not realized: for with us is God." The second imperatives in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-9.htm">Isaiah 8:9</a> are threatening words of authority, having a future signification, which change into futures in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19</a> (Ges. 130, 2): Go on exasperating yourselves &#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;( with the tone upon the penultimate, and therefore not the pual of &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, consociari, which is the rendering adopted in the Targum, but the kal of &#1512;&#1506;&#1506;, malum esse; not vociferari, for which &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, a different verb from the same root, is commonly employed), go on arming; ye will nevertheless fall to pieces (Cho&#772;ttu, from Cha&#770;thath, related to Ca&#770;thath, Confringi, Consternari). The prophet classes together all the nations that are warring against the people of God, pronounces upon them the sentence of destruction, and calls upon all distant lands to hear this ultimate fate of the kingdom of the world, i.e., of the imperial power. The world-kingdom must be wrecked on the land of Immanuel; "for with us," as the watchword of believers runs, pointing to the person of the Savour, "with us is God." </body></html>
