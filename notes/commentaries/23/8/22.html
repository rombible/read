Though not miraculous signs, the children's names were memorials from God, suited to excite attention. The unbelieving Jews were prone to seek counsel in difficulties, from diviners of different descriptions, whose foolish and sinful ceremonies are alluded to. Would we know how we may seek to our God, and come to the knowledge of his mind? To the law and to the testimony; for there you will see what is good, and what the Lord requires. We must speak of the things of God in the words which the Holy Ghost teaches, and be ruled by them. To those that seek to familiar spirits, and regard not God's law and testimony, there shall be horror and misery. Those that go away from God, go out of the way of all good; for fretfulness is a sin that is its own punishment. They shall despair, and see no way of relief, when they curse God. And their fears will represent every thing as frightful. Those that shut their eyes against the light of God's word, will justly be left to darkness. All the miseries that ever were felt or witnessed on earth, are as nothing, compared with what will overwhelm those who leave the words of Christ, to follow delusions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they shall look unto the earth - They would look upward and find no relief, and then in despair cast their eyes to the earth to obtain help there. Yet equally in vain. The whole image is one of intense anguish brought on the nation for leaving the counselor the true God.<p>And behold ... - see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-30.htm">Isaiah 5:30</a>.<p>Trouble - Anguish, oppression, &#1510;&#1512;&#1492;  tsa&#770;ra&#770;h, from &#1510;&#1493;&#1512;  tsu&#770;r, to oppress, to straiten, to afflict. This is a remarkable instance of the prophet Isaiah's manner - of a rapid, impetuous, and bold style of utterance. He accumulates images; piles words on each other; and deepens the anxiety by each additional word, until we almost feel that we are enveloped by the gloom, and see objects of terror and alarm on every side.<p>Dimness of anguish - These words should be kept separate in the translation - &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1492; &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;  me&#8219;u&#770;p tsu&#770;qa&#770;h, "darkness, oppression" - accumulated epithets to heighten the gloom and terror of the scene.<p>And they shall be driven to darkness - Hebrew, &#1502;&#1504;&#1491;&#1492; &#1493;&#1488;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;  va'a&#774;pe&#772;la&#770;h menuda&#772;ch a darkness that is driven, or that is urged upon itself; that becomes condensed, accumulated, until it becomes terrible and frightful. The idea is that of a driving tempest, or an involving obscurity (&#1502;&#1504;&#1491;&#1492;  menuda&#772;ch from &#1504;&#1491;&#1492;  na&#770;da&#770;h, to push, thrust, impel, urge on, as a driving storm). The prophet has thus accumulated every possible idea of gloom and obscurity, and probably there is not anywhere a more graphic description of gathering darkness and trouble, and of the consternation of those involved in it, than this. So fearful and terrific are the judgments of God when he comes forth to punish people! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21, 22. More detailed description of the despair, which they shall fall into, who sought necromancy instead of God; Isa 8:20 implies that too late they shall see how much better it would have been for them to have sought "to the law," &c. (De 32:31). But now they are given over to despair. Therefore, while seeing the truth of God, they only "curse their King and God"; foreshadowing the future, like conduct of those belonging to the "kingdom of the beast," when they shall be visited with divine plagues (Re 16:11; compare Jer 18:12).<p>through it&#8212;namely, the land.<p>hardly bestead&#8212;oppressed with anxiety.<p>hungry&#8212;a more grievous famine than the temporary one in Ahaz' time, owing to Assyria; then there was some food, but none now (Isa 7:15, 22; Le 26:3-5, 14-16, 20).<p>their king &#8230; God&#8212;Jehovah, King of the Jews (Ps 5:2; 68:24).<p>look upward &#8230; unto the earth&#8212;Whether they look up to heaven, or down towards the land of Judea, nothing but despair shall present itself.<p>dimness of anguish&#8212;darkness of distress (Pr 1:27).<p>driven to darkness&#8212;rather, "thick darkness" (Jer 23:12). Driven onward, as by a sweeping storm. The Jewish rejection of "their King and God," Messiah, was followed by all these awful calamities.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They shall look unto the earth; </span> finding no help from heaven, they turn their eyes downward, looking hither and thither for comfort. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Trouble and darkness.</span> &c.; many words expressing the same thing are put together, to signify the variety, and extremity, and continuance of their miseries. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they shall look unto the earth,....

A somewhat similar phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-12.htm" title="Why their way shall be to them as slippery ways in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil on them, even the year of their visitation, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 23:12</a>.

The darkness is spoken of as if it were a thing palpable, like rain or snow (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The words that follow in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-16.htm">Isaiah 8:16</a>, "Bind up the testimony, seal the lesson in my disciples," appear at first sight to be a command of God to the prophet, according to such parallel passages as <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-9.htm">Daniel 12:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/22-10.htm">Revelation 22:10</a>, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-26.htm">Daniel 8:26</a>; but with this explanation it is impossible to do justice to the words "in my disciples" (b'ilmmuda&#770;i). The explanation given by Rosenmller, Knobel, and others, viz., "by bringing in men divinely instructed" (adhibitis viris piis et sapientibus), is grammatically inadmissible. Consequently I agree with Vitringa, Drechsler, and others, in regarding <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-16.htm">Isaiah 8:16</a> as the prophet's own prayer to Jehovah. We tie together (&#1510;&#1512;&#1512;, imperf. &#1510;&#1493;&#1512;  equals  &#1510;&#1512;) what we wish to keep from getting separated and lost; we seal (Cha&#770;tam) what is to be kept secret, and only opened by a person duly qualified. And so the prophet here prays that Jehovah would take his testimony with regard to the future, and his instruction, which was designed to prepare for this future - that testimony and thorah which the great mass in their hardness did not understand, and in their self-hardening despised - and lay them up well secured and well preserved, as if by band and seal, in the hearts of those who received the prophet's words with believing obedience (limmu&#772;d, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-4.htm">Isaiah 50:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-13.htm">Isaiah 54:13</a>). For it would be all over with Israel, unless a community of believers should be preserved, and all over with this community, if the word of God, which was the ground of their life, should be allowed to slip from their hearts. We have here an announcement of the grand idea, which the second part of the book of Isaiah carries out in the grandest style. It is very evident that it is the prophet himself who is speaking here, as we may see from <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-17.htm">Isaiah 8:17</a>, where he continues to speak in the first person, though he does not begin with &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;. </body></html>
