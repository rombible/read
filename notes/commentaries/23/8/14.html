Are the contrasted clauses connected by any common link of imagery? To enter into fellowship with Jehovah, is to enter into the sanctuary. He who stands on the stone which forms the threshold of that sanctuary, has gained an asylum. But to do that requires the clear vision of faith. He who walks blindly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-10.htm" title="Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.">Isaiah 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-10.htm" title="But if a man walk in the night, he stumbles, because there is no light in him.">John 11:10</a>), without faith, may stumble on that very stone of the threshold, and what was safety and life for others, might for him bring pain and shame. He might be there sorely bruised (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-44.htm" title="And whoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.">Matthew 21:44</a>) like the wild animals taken in a trap (synonyms are heaped one upon another to increase the force of the imagery), till a helper came to release him. So, Isaiah says, was Jehovah “to both the houses of Israel” (the phrase is peculiar, and implies a hope of the restored unity of the nation’s life) in their self-chosen blindness. So St. Peter says, even the head corner-stone is to those who “stumble at the word, being disobedient” a “stone of stumbling and a rock of offence” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-8.htm" title="And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.">1Peter 2:8</a>). It lies in the nature of the case that the fall is not necessarily final and irretrievable. Men may be braised, but not “ground to powder;” may “stumble<span class= "ital">” </span>so that they may rise again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-44.htm" title="And whoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.">Matthew 21:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-34.htm" title="And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;">Luke 2:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-11.htm" title="I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall?

Their efforts would be vain, and themselves broken to pieces. It concerns us, in time of trouble, to watch against all such fears as put us upon crooked courses for our own security. The believing fear of God preserves against the disquieting fear of man. If we thought rightly of the greatness and glory of God, we should see all the power of our enemies restrained. The Lord, who will be a Sanctuary to those who trust in him, will be a Stone of stumbling, and a Rock of offence, to those who make the creature their fear and their hope. If the things of God be an offence to us, they will undo us. The apostle quotes this as to all who persisted in unbelief of the gospel of Christ, 1Pe 2:8. The crucified Emmanuel, who was and is a Stumbling-stone and Rock of offence to unbelieving Jews, is no less so to thousands who are called Christians. The preaching of the cross is foolishness in their esteem; his doctrines and precepts offend them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he shall be for a sanctuary - The word translated sanctuary means, literally, a holy place, a consecrated place, and is usually applied to the tabernacle, or to the temple; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/12-4.htm">Leviticus 12:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-12.htm">Leviticus 21:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-51.htm">Jeremiah 51:51</a>. It also means an asylum, or a refuge, to which one might flee in case of danger, and be safe; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-16.htm">Ezekiel 11:16</a>. Among all ancient nations, temples were regarded as safe places to which people might flee when pursued, and when in danger. It was deemed sacrilege to tear a man away from a temple or an altar. That the temple was so regarded among the Jews is manifest; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-50.htm">1 Kings 1:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-28.htm">1 Kings 2:28</a>. In allusion to this, the prophet says, that Yahweh would be a sanctuary; that is, an asylum, or refuge, to whom they should flee in times of danger, and be safe; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1</a> : 'God is our refuge and strength;' <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a> : 'The name of the Loan is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.' It is also well known that temples and altars were regarded as asyla among the Greeks and Romans. The reference here is rather to an altar, as the asylum, than to a city or temple; as, in the other member of the sentence, the same object is said to be a stone of stumbling - a figure which would not be applicable to a temple or a city.<p>A stone of stumbling - A stone against which one should impinge, or over which he should fall. The idea is, that none could run against a hard, rough, fixed stone, or rock, without injuring himself. So the Jews would oppose the counsels of God; instead of making him their refuge and strength, they would resist his claims and appeals, and the consequence would be their destruction. It is also to be remembered, that God is often represented in the Scriptures as a rock, a firm defense, or place of safety, to those who trust in him. But instead of their thus taking refuge in him, they would oppose themselves to this firm rock, and ruin themselves; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-18.htm">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30-31</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-37.htm">Deuteronomy 32:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-14.htm">Psalm 19:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-2.htm">Psalm 31:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-8.htm">Psalm 31:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-2.htm">Psalm 41:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-9.htm">Psalm 42:9</a>. Many of the ancient Jewish commentators applied this to the Messiah. - Gesenius in loc. It is also applied to Christ in the New Testament, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-8.htm">1 Peter 2:8</a>.<p>A rock of offence - A rock over which they should fall. The English word offence, had that meaning formerly, and retains it in our translation of the Bible.<p>To both the houses of Israel - To the two kingdoms of Judah and Israel; that is, to the wicked portion of them, not to those who were truly pious.<p>For a gin - A net, or snare, to take birds. The idea is the same as in the former part of the verse. By rejecting the counsel of God; by despising his protection, and by resisting his laws, they would be unexpectedly involved in difficulties, as birds which are caught in a snare. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. sanctuary&#8212;inviolable asylum, like the altar of the temple (1Ki 1:50; 2:28; Eze 11:16; compare Pr 18:10); namely, to those who fear and trust in Him.<p>but &#8230; offence&#8212;that is, a rock over which they should fall to their hurt; namely those who would not believe.<p>both &#8230; houses&#8212;Israel and Judah. Here again the prophecy expands beyond the temporary application in Ahaz' time. The very stone, Immanuel, which would have been a sanctuary on belief, becomes a fatal stumbling-block through unbelief. Jesus Christ refers to this in Mt 21:44. (Compare De 32:4, 15, 18, 30, 31, 37; Da 2:34; Ro 9:33; 1Pe 2:8).<p>gin&#8212;trap, in which birds are unexpectedly caught (Lu 21:35; 1Th 5:2).

And that such a place and people should reject Immanuel, or their Messiah, when he should appear, was so great and strange an occurrent, that the prediction of it was highly necessary, lest otherwise, when it came to pass, it should shake the faith of all who did believe on him; whereas now the accomplishment hereof was a notable confirmation of their faith, and an evidence that Christ was the true Messiah. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he shall be for a sanctuary,.... Not the king of Assyria, as Aben Ezra, but the Lord of hosts: the Targum rightly interprets it of the word of the Lord, the essential Word; of the Messiah, who is for a sanctuary, or asylum, a place of refuge for his people in all times of distress, and who is their dwelling place in all generations; he dwells in them, and they dwell in him; and where they dwell safely and securely, peaceably and quietly, comfortably and pleasantly, and that always; he is a sanctuary to worship in, in whom they draw nigh to the Father, and offer up the sacrifices of prayer and praise, and where the glory of God is seen by them, and they have communion with him; or "for sanctification", as the Septuagint version; this Christ is to his people, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>, <p>but for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of offence, to both the houses of Israel: which Jarchi interprets of Pekah, the son of Remaliah, and his company, and of Shebna and his company; but Aben Ezra much better of the kingdoms of Israel and of Judah, especially when the twelve tribes were under one form of government in Christ's time. In the Talmud (u) it is explained of the two houses of the fathers of Israel; and these are they, the head of the captivity in Babylon, and the prince in the land of Israel; and the Nazarenes, as Jerom (w) reports, apply the words to the two houses or families of Hillel and Shammai, who were two heads of schools in Jerusalem, a little before the times of Christ, and were of the sect of the Pharisees; and to whom indeed Christ was a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, as he was to the Jews in common; who were offended and stumbled at his birth and parentage, he descending from poor parents; at his education and place of bringing up; at the mean appearance of himself and his followers; at the obscurity of his kingdom, it not being of this world, nor coming with observation; at the company he kept, and the audience that attended on him; at his doctrines and miracles; and at his death, and the manner of it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-32.htm">Romans 9:32</a>. <p>For a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem; even the principal inhabitants of it, such as the elders of the people, priests, Scribes, and Pharisees, who sought to entangle Christ in his talk, and to ensnare him by questions they put unto him; but were themselves snared and taken, convicted, confounded, and silenced.

This contrast would certainly be clearer if (with the Targ. and Vulg.) we might insert “to you” after “shall be.” But the want of these words hardly justifies us in changing the text, or even in translating “He will shew Himself a holy object,” in the sense explained by the remainder of the verse. Although it is doubtful if the word is ever used for “asylum,” yet the sanctuary was in fact an asylum (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-14.htm" title="But if a man come presumptuously on his neighbor, to slay him with guile; you shall take him from my altar, that he may die.">Exodus 21:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-50.htm" title="And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.">1 Kings 1:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-28.htm" title="Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom.

The fate of Judah would be different from that of Ephraim. Ephraim would be laid completely under water by the river, i.e., would be utterly destroyed. And in Judah the stream, as it rushed forward, would reach the most dangerous height; but if a deliverer could be found, there was still a possibility of its being saved. Such a deliverer was Immanuel, whom the prophet sees in the light of the Spirit living through all the Assyrian calamities. The prophet appeals complainingly to him that the land, which is his land, is almost swallowed up by the world-power: the spreadings out (muttoth, a hophal noun: for similar substantive forms, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-6.htm">Isaiah 14:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-3.htm">Isaiah 29:3</a>, and more especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-11.htm">Psalm 66:11</a>) of the wings of the stream (i.e., of the large bodies of water pouring out on both sides from the main stream, as from the trunk, and covering the land like two broad wings) have filled the whole land. According to Norzi, Immanul is to be written here as one word, as it is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>; but the correct reading is Imma&#770;n El, with mercha silluk (see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>), though it does not therefore cease to be a proper name.
