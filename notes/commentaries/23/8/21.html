The abruptness with which the verse opens, the absence of any noun to which the pronoun “it” may refer, has led some critics (Cheyne) to transpose the two verses. So arranged, the thought of the people for whom there is no dawning passes naturally into the picture of their groping in that thick darkness. and then the misery of that midnight wandering is aggravated by the horrors of starvation. The words may point to the horrors of a literal famine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-11.htm" title="The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.">Isaiah 2:11</a>); but as the darkness is clearly figurative, so probably is the hunger—not a famine of bread, but of hearing the word of the Lord. The Authorised version rightly translates the indefinite singular by the plural.<p><span class= "bld">When they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves.</span>—The faithful who waited for the Lord might bear even that darkness and that hunger, as soldiers bear their night-march fasting before the battle. Not so with the panic-stricken and superstitious crowd. With them despair would show itself in curses. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-11.htm" title="And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.">Revelation 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-21.htm" title="And there fell on men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.">Revelation 16:21</a>.) They would curse at once the king who had led them to destruction, and the God whom they had neglected. Possibly the words may mean, “the king who is also their God,” as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-26.htm" title="But you have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.">Amos 5:26</a> (Heb.) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-5.htm" title="And them that worship the host of heaven on the housetops; and them that worship and that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham;">Zephaniah 1:5</a>; but the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-13.htm" title="And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.">1Kings 21:13</a> is in favour of the more literal meaning. The “upward” look is, we must remember, that of despair and defiance, not of hope. Upwards, downwards, behind, before, there is nothing for them but the darkness in which they are driven, or drifting onward. All seems utterly hopeless. Like Dante, they find themselves in a land “where silent is the sun.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/8-21.htm" title="And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward....">Isaiah 8:21-22</a>. </span><span class="ital">And they </span>— The idolatrous and apostate Israelites; <span class="ital">shall pass through it </span>— Namely, their own land, into captivity; or, as <span class="greekheb">עבר בה</span> may be rendered, <span class="ital">shall pass to and fro, </span>or <span class="ital">wander hither and thither, in it, </span>like distracted men, not knowing whither to go, or what to do; whereas, if they had not forsaken God, they might have had a quiet and settled abode in it. <span class="ital">Hardly bestead and hung</span>r<span class="ital">y — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">נקשׁה ורעב</span>, <span class="ital">distressed and famished, </span>as Bishop Lowth translates the words: <span class="ital">they shall fret themselves, </span>&c. — Shall be impatient under their pressures, and, in the rage of their despair, <span class="ital">curse their king </span>— To whose ill conduct they impute a great part of their miseries; <span class="ital">and their God </span>— Their idol, to whom they trusted, and whom now, too late, they find to be unable to help them; <span class="ital">and look upward — </span>To heaven for help, as men of all nations and religions, in great calamities, are wont to do. <span class="ital">And they shall look unto the earth </span>— Finding no help from heaven, they turn their eyes downward, looking hither and thither for comfort; <span class="ital">and behold trouble and darkness, </span>&c. — Many words, expressing the same thing, are put together, to signify the variety, and extremity, and continuance of their miseries. Bishop Lowth, who connects with this verse the last clause of the twenty-first, renders the passage thus: “He shall cast his eyes upward, and look down to the earth; and lo! distress and darkness! gloom, tribulation, and accumulated darkness!” <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:17-22 The prophet foresaw that the Lord would hide his face; but he would look for his return in favour to them again. Though not miraculous signs, the children's names were memorials from God, suited to excite attention. The unbelieving Jews were prone to seek counsel in difficulties, from diviners of different descriptions, whose foolish and sinful ceremonies are alluded to. Would we know how we may seek to our God, and come to the knowledge of his mind? To the law and to the testimony; for there you will see what is good, and what the Lord requires. We must speak of the things of God in the words which the Holy Ghost teaches, and be ruled by them. To those that seek to familiar spirits, and regard not God's law and testimony, there shall be horror and misery. Those that go away from God, go out of the way of all good; for fretfulness is a sin that is its own punishment. They shall despair, and see no way of relief, when they curse God. And their fears will represent every thing as frightful. Those that shut their eyes against the light of God's word, will justly be left to darkness. All the miseries that ever were felt or witnessed on earth, are as nothing, compared with what will overwhelm those who leave the words of Christ, to follow delusions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they shall pass - The people who have been consulting necromancers.

(De 32:31). But now they are given over to despair. Therefore, while seeing the truth of God, they only "curse their King and God"; foreshadowing the future, like conduct of those belonging to the "kingdom of the beast," when they shall be visited with divine plagues (Re 16:11; compare Jer 18:12).<p>through it&#8212;namely, the land.<p>hardly bestead&#8212;oppressed with anxiety.<p>hungry&#8212;a more grievous famine than the temporary one in Ahaz' time, owing to Assyria; then there was some food, but none now (Isa 7:15, 22; Le 26:3-5, 14-16, 20).<p>their king &#8230; God&#8212;Jehovah, King of the Jews (Ps 5:2; 68:24).<p>look upward &#8230; unto the earth&#8212;Whether they look up to heaven, or down towards the land of Judea, nothing but despair shall present itself.<p>dimness of anguish&#8212;darkness of distress (Pr 1:27).<p>driven to darkness&#8212;rather, "thick darkness" (Jer 23:12).

The land, as the Targum and Kimchi supply it; that is, the land of Judea, as Aben Ezra interprets it. Here begins an account of the punishment that should be inflicted on the Jews, for their neglect of the prophecies of the Old Testament, and their rejection of the Messiah: <p>hardly bestead and hungry; put to the greatest difficulty to get food to eat, and famishing for want of it; which some understand of the time when Sennacherib's army was before Jerusalem, as Aben Ezra; but it seems better, with others, to refer it to the times of Zedekiah, when there was a sore famine, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-6.htm">Jeremiah 52:6</a> though best of all to the besieging of Jerusalem, by the Romans, and the times preceding it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-7.htm">Matthew 24:7</a> and it may also be applied to the famine of hearing the word before that, when the Gospel, the kingdom of heaven, was taken from them, for their contempt of it: <p>and it shall come to pass, when they shall be hungry: either in a temporal sense, having no food for their bodies; or in a mystical sense, being hungry often and earnestly desirous of the coming of their vainly expected Messiah, as a temporal Saviour of them: <p>they shall fret themselves; for want of food for their bodies, to satisfy their hunger; or because their Messiah does not come to help them: <p>and curse their King, and their God; the true Messiah, who is the King of Israel, and God manifest in the flesh; whom the unbelieving Jews called accursed, and blasphemed: <p>and look upwards; to heaven, for the coming of another Messiah, but in vain; or for food to eat. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they shall pass through it, distressed and hungry: and it shall come to <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> and curse their king and their God, and look upward.</span><p>(a) That is, in Judah, where they would have had rest, if they had not thus grievously offended God.<p>(b) In whom before they put their trust.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">they shall pass through it</span>] Obviously, the land; but something must have fallen out before this verse, to account for the reference of the pronoun. Throughout this and the following verse, “they,” “their,” “themselves,” should be “he,” “his,” “himself.” The subject is either the whole nation or an individual Israelite. He wanders through the land, perhaps seeking an oracle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-12.htm" title="And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find it.">Amos 8:12</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they shall fret themselves</span>] Better: <span class="bld">he shall break out in anger</span> (the form is used only here).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">curse</span> <span class="bld">his</span> <span class="ital">king and</span> <span class="bld">his</span> <span class="ital">God</span>] Not “his king and God” whether Jehovah or a false god; but the king because he cannot, and God because He will not, help. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-26.htm" title="And as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, there cried a woman to him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.">2 Kings 6:26</a> f.

And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.">1 Kings 21:10</a>).

But this bold solution of a difficulty is scarcely to be commended, there being no limit to its use. An order followed in all the manuscripts should not be disturbed, if it gives any tolerable sense. Such a sense can, it is thought, be found here by regarding the two verses as exegetical of the last clause of ver. 20 - "when there is no dawn for them." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall pass through it</span>. "It," which is feminine, must mean "the land."

"Jehovah of hosts, sanctify Him; and let Him be your fear, and let Him be your terror. So will He become a sanctuary, but a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence (vexation) to both the houses of Israel, a snare and trap to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And many among them shall stumble, and shall fall; and be dashed to pieces, and be snared and taken." The logical apodosis to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-13.htm">Isaiah 8:13</a> commences with v'ha&#770;ha&#770;h (so shall He be). If ye actually acknowledge Jehovah the Holy One as the Holy One (hikd&#305;&#772;sh, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-23.htm">Isaiah 29:23</a>), and if it is He whom ye fear, and who fills you with dread (ma&#8219;ar&#305;&#772;tz, used for the object of dread, as mo&#772;rah is for the object of fear; hence "that which terrifies" in a causative sense), He will become a mikda&#770;sh. The word mikda&#770;sh may indeed denote the object sanctified, and so Knobel understands it here according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-29.htm">Numbers 18:29</a>; but if we adhere to the strict notion of the word, this gives an unmeaning apodosis. Mikda&#770;sh generally means the sanctified place or sanctuary, with which the idea of an asylum would easily associate itself, since even among the Israelites the temple was regarded and respected as an asylum (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-50.htm">1 Kings 1:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-28.htm">1 Kings 2:28</a>). This is the explanation which most of the commentators have adopted here; and the punctuators also took it in the same sense, when they divided the two halves of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a> by athnach as antithetical. And mikda&#770;sh is really to be taken in this sense, although it cannot be exactly rendered "asylum," since this would improperly limit the meaning of the word. The temple was not only a place of shelter, but also of grace, blessing, and peace. All who sanctified the Lord of lords He surrounded like temple walls; hid them in Himself, whilst death and tribulation reigned without, and comforted, fed, and blessed them in His own gracious fellowship. This is the true explanation of v'ha&#770;ya&#770;h l'mikda&#770;s, according to such passages as <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-21.htm">Psalm 31:21</a>. To the two houses of Israel, on the contrary, i.e., to the great mass of the people of both kingdoms who neither sanctified nor feared Jehovah, He would be a rock and snare. The synonyms are intentionally heaped together (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-13.htm">Isaiah 28:13</a>), to produce the fearful impression of death occurring in many forms, but all inevitable. The first three verbs of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-15.htm">Isaiah 8:15</a> refer to the "stone" ('eben) and "rock" (tzu&#772;r); the last two to the "snare" (pach), and "trap" or springe (mo&#772;ke&#772;sh).<p>(Note: Malbim observes quite correctly, that "the pach catches, but does not hurt; the mokesh catches and hurts (e.g., by seizing the legs or nose, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-24.htm">Job 40:24</a>): the former is a simple snare (or net), the latter a springe, or snare which catches by means of a spring" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-5.htm">Amos 3:5</a>).)<p>All who did not give glory to Jehovah would be dashed to pieces upon His work as upon a stone, and caught therein as in a trap. This was the burden of the divine warning, which the prophet heard for himself and for those that believed. </body></html>
