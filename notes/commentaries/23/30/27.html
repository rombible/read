With a word he guides his people into the right way, but with a bridle he turns his enemies upon their own ruin. Here, in threatening the ruin of Sennacherib's army, the prophet points at the final and everlasting destruction of all impenitent sinners. Tophet was a valley near Jerusalem, where fires were continually burning to destroy things that were hurtful and offensive, and there the idolatrous Jews caused their children to pass through the fire to Moloch. This denotes the certainty of the destruction, as an awful emblem of the place of torment in the other world. No oppressor shall escape the Divine wrath. Let sinners then flee to Christ, seeking to be reconciled to Him, that they may be safe and happy, when destruction from the Almighty shall sweep away all the workers of iniquity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, the name of the Lord cometh - (compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>). The verses following, to the end of the chapter, are designed evidently to describe the destruction of the army of Sennacherib. This is expressly declared in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-31.htm">Isaiah 30:31</a>, and all the circumstances in the prediction accord with that event. There is no necessity of supposing that this is the commencement of a new prophecy, for it is connected with the main subject in the previous part of the chapter. The whole prophecy was composed evidently in view of that threatened invasion. In the apprehension of that, they sought the aid of Egypt <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-6</a>, for that, the prophet denounces judgment on them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-8.htm">Isaiah 30:8</a> ff); in view of these judgments, however, he promises a more happy state <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-18.htm">Isaiah 30:18-26</a>; and now, in the close of the chapter, in order to deter them from the alliance, he assures them that, without any foreign aid, the Assyrian would be destroyed by Yahweh himself. The phrase 'name of Yahweh,' is probably another mode of designating Yahweh himself; as the name of God is often put for God himself (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6-7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-12.htm">Acts 3:12</a>, 30; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-10.htm">Acts 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>). The idea is, that the destruction of the Assyrian hosts would be accomplished by the immediate power of Yahweh himself without any need of the aid of the Egyptian or of any foreign alliances.<p>From afar - That is, from heaven (compare the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>).<p>Burning with his anger - Or, rather, his anger is enkindled.<p>And the burden thereof - Margin, 'Grievousness of flame.'

From hence to the end of the chapter <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-28.htm">Isaiah 30:28</a> is a very full account, by way of prophecy, of the destruction of the Assyrian army by the Lord; and which is to be considered as a type of the destruction of antichrist, by and at the coming of the Lord Jesus. It is introduced with a "behold", as declaring something of moment and importance worthy of attention, and even wonderful. "The name of the Lord" is the Lord himself; unless it is to be understood of the angel that came in the name of the Lord, and destroyed Sennacherib's army; who may be said to come "from far", because he came from heaven; and from whence Christ the Angel uncreated, in whom the name of the Lord is, will come to judge the world, and to take vengeance on all his and his people's enemies, antichrist and all his followers: <p>burning with his anger; against the Assyrian monarch and his army. So our Lord, when he shall come forth to make war with the antichristian kings of the earth, his "eyes" shall be "as a flame of fire": and when he comes to judge the world, he will descend in "flaming fire", <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a> the day of the Lord will burn as an oven, <a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/4-1.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>, <p>and the burden thereof is heavy: the punishment inflicted, in his burning anger and hot displeasure, will be heavy, even intolerable, heavier than it can be borne, as the Targum paraphrases it; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/4-13.htm">Genesis 4:13</a>, <p>his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire; the words he will utter, the sentence he will pronounce, will be dreadful, executed by the angel; so the sharp sword that goes out of the mouth of Christ, with which he will smite the nations; and such the awful sentence pronounced by him on the wicked, "go, ye cursed, into everlasting fire", &amp;c. see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>.

"For a people continues dwelling in Zion, in Jerusalem; thou shalt not weep for ever: He will prove Himself gracious to thee at the sound of thy cry for help; as soon as He hears, He answers thee. And the Lord giveth you bread in penury, and water for your need; and thy teachers will not hide themselves any more, and thine eyes come to see thy teachers. And thine ears will hear words behind thee, saying, 'This is the way, walk ye in it!' whether ye turn to the right hand or to the left. And ye defile the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the clothing of thy molten images of gold; thou wilt scatter them like filthy thing: 'Get out!' thou sayest to it." We do not render <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-19.htm">Isaiah 30:19</a>, "For O people that dwelleth in Zion, in Jerusalem!" For although the personal pronoun may be omitted after Vav in an apostrophizing connection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-5.htm">Proverbs 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23</a>), we should certainly expect to find &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; here. The accent very properly marks these words as forming an independent clause. The apparent tautology in the expression, "in Zion, in Jerusalem," is emphatic and explanatory. The fate of Zion-Jerusalem will not be the same as that of the imperial city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-2.htm">Isaiah 25:2</a>); for it is the city of Jehovah, which, according to His promise, cannot become an eternally deserted ruin. After this promising declaration, the prophet turns and addresses the people of the future in the people of his own time; ba&#770;kho&#772; strengthens the verbal notion with the mark of duration; cha&#770;no&#772;n with the mark of certainty and fulness. &#1497;&#1495;&#1504;&#1498;, with an advanced o&#774;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-29.htm">Genesis 43:29</a>, for &#1497;&#1495;&#1503;. &#1499;&#1468; is the shortest expression used to denote simultaneous occurrence; answering and hearing would coincide (shom&#8219;a&#770;h, nomen actionis, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-9.htm">Isaiah 47:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-2.htm">Isaiah 55:2</a>; Ges. 45, 1b; &#8219;a&#770;na&#770;kh, the pausal form here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-37.htm">Jeremiah 23:37</a>). From this lowest stage of response to the penitential cry for help, the promise rises higher and higher. The next stage is that in which Jerusalem is brought into all the distress consequent upon a siege, as threatened by the prophet in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-3.htm">Isaiah 29:3-4</a>; the besieged would not be allowed by God to die of starvation, but He would send them the necessary support. The same expression, but very little altered, viz., "to give to eat lechem lachatz u&#772;mayim lachatz," signifies to put any one upon the low rations of a siege or of imprisonment, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-27.htm">1 Kings 22:27</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-26.htm">2 Chronicles 18:26</a>; but here it is a promise, with the threat kept in the background. &#1510;&#1512; and &#1500;&#1495;&#1509; are connected with the absolute nouns &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; and &#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, not as adverbial, but as appositional definitions (like &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1497;&#1497;&#1503;, "wine which is giddiness," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-5.htm">Psalm 60:5</a>; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, "water which is knees," i.e., which has the measure of the knees, where birkayim is also in apposition, and not the accusative of measurement): literally, bread which is necessity, and water which is affliction; that is to say, nourishment of which there is extreme need, the very opposite of bread and water in abundance. Umbreit and Drechsler understand this spiritually. But the promise rises as it goes on. There is already an advance, in the fact that the faithful and well-meaning teachers (mo&#772;r&#305;&#772;m) no longer keep themselves hidden because of the hard-heartedness and hatred of the people, as they have done ever since the time of Ahaz (&#1504;&#1499;&#1504;&#1507;, a denom.: to withdraw into &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1507;, &#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;, the utmost end, the most secret corner; though ka&#770;naph in itself signifies to cover or conceal). Israel, when penitent, would once more be able to rejoice in the sight of those whom it longed to have back again. &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; is a plural, according to the context (on the singular of the previous predicate, see Ges. 147). As the shepherds of the flock, they would follow the people with friendly words of admonition, whilst the people would have their ears open to receive their instruction. &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is here equivalent to &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;. The abominations of idolatry (which continued even in the first years of Hezekiah's reign: <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-7.htm">Isaiah 31:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-5.htm">Micah 1:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-11.htm">Micah 5:11-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-16.htm">Micah 6:16</a>) would now be regarded as abominations, and put away. Even gold and silver, with which the images that were either carved or cast in inferior metal were overlaid, would be made unclean (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/28-8.htm">2 Kings 28:8</a>ff.); that is to say, no use would be made of them. Da&#770;va&#770;h is a shorter expression for kel&#305;&#772; da&#770;va&#770;h, the cloth worn by a woman at the monthly period. On za&#770;ra&#770;h, to dispense - to which da&#770;va&#770;h would be inappropriate if understood of the woman herself, as it is by Luzzatto - compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-6.htm">2 Kings 23:6</a>. With &#1494;&#1492;&#1489;&#1498;, the plural used in the general address passes over into the individualizing singular; &#1500;&#1493; is to be taken as a neuter pointing back to the plunder of idols. </body></html>
