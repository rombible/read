With a word he guides his people into the right way, but with a bridle he turns his enemies upon their own ruin. Here, in threatening the ruin of Sennacherib's army, the prophet points at the final and everlasting destruction of all impenitent sinners. Tophet was a valley near Jerusalem, where fires were continually burning to destroy things that were hurtful and offensive, and there the idolatrous Jews caused their children to pass through the fire to Moloch. This denotes the certainty of the destruction, as an awful emblem of the place of torment in the other world. No oppressor shall escape the Divine wrath. Let sinners then flee to Christ, seeking to be reconciled to Him, that they may be safe and happy, when destruction from the Almighty shall sweep away all the workers of iniquity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And in every place - Margin, 'Every passing of the rod founded.' Lowth renders it, 'Whenever shall pass the rod of correction.' The whole design of the passage is evidently to foretell the sudden destruction of the army of the Assyrians, and to show that this would be accomplished by the agency of God. The idea seems to be, that in all those places where the rod of the Assyrian would pass, that is, where he would cause devastation and desolation, there would be the sound of rejoicing with instruments of music when he should be overthrown.<p>The grounded staff - The word 'staff' here, or "rod," seems to refer to that by which the Assyrian smote the nations <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-31.htm">Isaiah 30:31</a>; or rather perhaps the Assyrian king himself as a rod of correction in the hand of Yahweh (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>). The word rendered 'grounded' (&#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1491;&#1492;  mu&#770;sa&#770;da&#770;h) has given great perplexity to commentators. Lowth supposes it should be &#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512;&#1495; ("correction"), according to a conjecture of Le Clerc. Two manuscripts also read it in the same way. But the authority from the MSS. is not sufficient to justify a change in the present Hebrew text. This word, which is not very intelligibly rendered 'grounded,' is derived from &#1497;&#1505;&#1491;  ya&#770;sad, to "found, to lay the foundation of a building" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-12.htm">Ezra 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-11.htm">Isaiah 54:11</a>; then to establish, to appoint, to ordain <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-8.htm">Psalm 104:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-12.htm">Habakkuk 1:12</a>. The idea here is, therefore, that the rod referred to had been "appointed, constituted, ordained" by God; that is, that the Assyrian had been designated by him to accomplish important purposes as a rod, or as a means of punishing the nations.<p>Shall pass - In his march of desolation and conquest.<p>Which the Lord shall lay upon him - Or rather, as it should be translated, 'upon which Yahweh should lay,' that is, the rod, meaning that in all those places where Yahweh should lay this appointed scourge there would be yet rejoicing.<p>It shall be with tabrets and harps - Those places where he had passed, and which he had scourged, would be filled with joy and rejoicing at his complete overthrow, and at their entire deliverance from the scourge. For a description of the tabret and harp, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>.<p>And in battles of shaking - In the Hebrew there is an allusion here to what is said in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-28.htm">Isaiah 30:28</a>, that he would 'sift,' that is, agitate or toss the nations as in a winnowing shovel.<p>Will he fight with it - Margin, 'Against them.'

The storm before mentioned, the wrath and righteous judgment of God, founded upon his unalterable purposes and decrees; and, wherever it came, would fall with great weight, sink deep, stick fast, and remain fixed and sure, like a rod or staff fastened in the earth: <p>which the Lord shall lay upon him; or, "cause to rest upon him" (o); the Lord would lay his rod upon him, the Assyrian, and let it remain there, so that it should be a destroying rod or staff, as before; it should continue until it had done full execution, and utterly destroyed him. The Targum is, <p>"and there shall be every passage of their princes, and of their mighty ones, on whom the Lord shall cause to rest the vengeance of his power;'' <p>and so the "grounded staff" may be understood of the Assyrian himself, that wherever he should be, this storm of vengeance should follow him, and rest upon him: <p>it shall be with tabrets and harps; the allusion is to the use of these in war; but, instead of these, no other music would be used at this time than what thunder, and rain, and hailstones made; unless this refers to the joy of God's people, upon the destruction of their enemies; so the Targum, <p>"with tabrets, and harps shall the house of Israel praise, because of the mighty war which shall be made for them among the people:'' <p>see <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/15-2.htm">Revelation 15:2</a>, <p>and in battles of shaking will he fight with it; the Assyrian camp; or as the Keri, or marginal reading, "with them": with the Assyrians, with the men of the camp; the soldiers, as Kimchi explains it; that is, the Lord will fight with them in battles, by shaking his hand over them in a way of judgment, and thereby shaking them to pieces, and utterly destroying them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a>. <p>(o) "requiescere faciet", Pagninus, Montanus; "quiescere faciet", Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/30.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And <i>in</i> every place where the grounded staff shall pass, <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> which the LORD shall lay upon him, <i>it</i> shall be with <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> tabrets and harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> with it.</span><p>(d) It will destroy.<p>(e) With joy and assurance of the victory.<p>(f) Against Babel, meaning the Assyrians and Babylonians.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/30.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">32</span>. The verse may be translated as in R.V. <span class="bld">And every stroke of the appointed staff which the Lord shall lay upon him shall be with tabrets and harps; and in battles of shaking will he fight with them</span>. The expression “grounded staff” is, however, barely intelligible; the emendation “staff of correction” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-15.htm" title="Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.">Proverbs 22:15</a>) only replaces one singular expression by another, and is besides too easy to be worth much. The phrase “battles of shaking” is also difficult. “Battles of the swinging (of Jehovah’s rod)” is the construction usually put upon it, but the sense is rhetorically weak. The word for “shaking” is the technical term for the “wave offering” in the Law (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-30.htm" title="His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD.">Leviticus 7:30</a>); hence Ewald renders “battles of wave-offering,” i.e. battles in which Assyria is devoted to destruction.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In every place where the grounded staff shall pass,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">and it shall come to pass that every stroke</span> (literally, <span class="accented">passage</span>) <span class="accented">of the destined rod which Jehovah causes to rest upon him shall be with an accompaniment of drums and citherns</span>.

"And the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be multiplied sevenfold, like the light of seven days, in the day that Jehovah bindeth the hurt of His people, and healeth the crushing of His stroke." Modern commentators from Lowth downwards for the most part pronounce &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1514; &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512; a gloss; and there is one external evidence in favour of this, which is wanting in the case of the other supposed glosses in Isaiah, namely, that the words are omitted by the lxx (though not by the Targum, the Syriac, or Jerome). Even Luther (although he notices these words in his exposition and sermons) merely renders them, der Sonnen schein wird siebenmal heller sein denn jtzt (the sunlight will be seven times as bright as it is now). But the internal evidence does not favour their spuriousness even in the case before us; for the fact that the regularity of the verse, as consisting of four members, is thereby disturbed, is no evidence at all, since the v. could be warranted in a pentastic quite as well as in a tetrastic form. We therefore decide in this instance also in favour of the conclusion that the prophet composed the gloss himself. But we cannot maintain, with Umbreit, that the addition was necessary, in order to guard against the idea that there would be seven suns shining in the sky; for the prophet does not predict a multiplication of the sun by seven, but simply the multiplication of its light. The seven days are the length of an ordinary week. Drechsler gives it correctly: "The radiated light, which is sufficient to produce the daylight for a whole week according to the existing order of things, will then be concentrated into a single day." Luther renders it in this way, als wenn sieben tag ynn eynander geschlossen weren (as if seven days were enclosed in one another). This also is not meant figuratively, any more than Paul means is figuratively, when he says, that with the manifestation of the "glory" of the children of God, the "corruption" of universal nature will come to an end. Nevertheless, it is not of the new heaven that the prophet is speaking, but of the glorification of nature, which is promised by both the Old Testament prophecy and by that of the New at the closing period of the world's history, and which will be the closing typical self-annunciation of that eternal glory in which everything will be swallowed up. The brightest, sunniest days then alternate, as the prophet foretells, with the most brilliant moonlight nights. No other miracles will be needed for this than that wonder-working power of God, which even now produces those changes of weather, the laws of which no researches of natural science have enabled us to calculate, and which will then give the greatest brilliancy and most unchangeable duration to what is now comparatively rare - namely, a perfectly unclouded sky, with sun or moon shining in all its brilliancy, yet without any scorching from the one, or injurious effects from the other. Heaven and earth will then put on their sabbath dress; for it will be the Sabbath of the world's history, the seventh day in the world's week. The light of the seven days of the world's week will be all concentrated in the seventh. For the beginning of creation was light, and its close will be light as well. The darkness all comes between, simply that it may be overcome. At last will come a bo&#772;qer (morning), after which it will no more be said, "And evening was, and morning was." The prophet is speaking of the last type of this morning. What he predicts here precedes what he predicted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>, just as the date of its composition precedes that of chapters 24-27; for there the imperial city was Babylon, whereas here the glory of the latter day is still placed immediately after the fall of Assyria. </body></html>
