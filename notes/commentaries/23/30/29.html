In later times, and probably, therefore, in earlier, it had a night-ritual of special solemnity, the court of the Temple being illuminated with a great candelabrum. It was known as being pre-eminently <span class= "ital">“the </span>feast” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-2.htm" title="And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.">1Kings 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-65.htm" title="And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath to the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.">1Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-32.htm" title="And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like to the feast that is in Judah, and he offered on the altar.

With a word he guides his people into the right way, but with a bridle he turns his enemies upon their own ruin. Here, in threatening the ruin of Sennacherib's army, the prophet points at the final and everlasting destruction of all impenitent sinners. Tophet was a valley near Jerusalem, where fires were continually burning to destroy things that were hurtful and offensive, and there the idolatrous Jews caused their children to pass through the fire to Moloch. This denotes the certainty of the destruction, as an awful emblem of the place of torment in the other world. No oppressor shall escape the Divine wrath. Let sinners then flee to Christ, seeking to be reconciled to Him, that they may be safe and happy, when destruction from the Almighty shall sweep away all the workers of iniquity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye shall have a song - That is, ye inhabitants of Jerusalem shall rejoice when the army of the Assyrian is destroyed.<p>As in the night, when a solemnity is kept - The word 'solemnity' here (&#1495;&#1490;  cha&#770;g) denotes a festival, or feast; and refers, by way of eminence, to the Passover, which is usually designated as "the feast;" that is, the principal festival of the Jews (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-15.htm">Matthew 27:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-1.htm">John 5:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-11.htm">John 5:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-13.htm">John 5:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-23.htm">John 5:23</a>).

That is, the Jews should have a song, and sing it upon the ruin of the Assyrian army; as the Israelites had, when Pharaoh and his host were drowned in the Red Sea; and so will the Christian church have one, at the fall of Babylon, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/15-1.htm">Revelation 15:1</a>, <p>as in the night, when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, the Jewish feasts always began, the even preceding, and were ushered in with singing songs, and psalms; especially the feast of the passover, which it is thought is alluded to here. It is a common notion of the Jews (k), that the slaughter of the Assyrian army was on the night of the passover; that it was in the night is certain, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a> but that it was on the night of the passover is not certain; however, the songs sung on that night were not on this occasion, nor could this be sung so soon; and it will be at evening time that the latter day glory shall break out, and songs of joy be heard from the uttermost parts of the earth, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-7.htm">Zechariah 14:7</a>, <p>as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the Lord; the temple; it being usual for persons, that came from distant parts of the land to the temple to worship, to bring pipes along with them in their hands, and play upon them as they were travelling, to divert them, and the company that were with them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-4.htm">Psalm 42:4</a>. Jarchi thinks the allusion is to the bringing up of the first fruits to the temple at Jerusalem, which was preceded with a pipe, as appears from the Misnah (l): <p>to the mighty One of Israel; or, "Rock of Israel" (m); one of the names of the Messiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3</a> to whom the song of praise and triumph shall be sung, in the latter day, by those that stand upon Mount Zion, with harps in their hands, having gotten the victory over the beast and his image, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>. <p>(k) Vid.

The song will be like that <span class="bld">in the night when a feast is hallowed</span> (R.V. marg.). The feast is probably the Passover, the only festival which, so far as we know, included a nocturnal ceremony, in the O.T. times. That singing then formed a part of the ritual (as in the time of Christ: <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-30.htm" title="And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.">Matthew 26:30</a>), cannot be proved, but it is not unlikely that this was the case. The reason why this particular festival is selected for comparison may be that it commemorated the deliverance of Israel from Egypt. It is thought by many that the “Song of Moses,” Exodus 15, was used as a Paschal hymn.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as when one goeth with a pipe</span>] Or: <span class="bld">like his who marches with a flute,</span> &c.

Perhaps a special reference is intended to the Pass-over-feast, which commenced with an even-tag or night celebration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-6.htm">Exodus 12:6, 8, 42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-30.htm">Matthew 26:30</a>). Or perhaps "Isaiah is not referring to one feast more than another" (Cheyne), night-rituals belonging to all toasts, since the day commenced with the sunset. The Passover-song consisted of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/113.htm">Psalm 113</a>. - 118. <span class="cmt_word">And as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the Lord</span>. Joyful processions from the country districts to Jerusalem are alluded to. These were commonly headed by a piper or a band of pipers (Vitringa). They took place several times in the year - at each of the three great feasts, and irregularly when any district sent up its firstfruits to the temple treasury (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-35.htm">Nehemiah 10:35-37</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To the Mighty One of Israel</span>; literally, to <span class="accented">the Rock of Israel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to Jehovah (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-10.htm">Isaiah 17:10</a>; and see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4, 15, 18, 30, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2, 31, 46</a>, etc.).

"And He gives rain to thy seed, with which thou sowest the land; and bread of the produce of the land, and it is full of sap and fat: in that day your flocks will feed in roomy pastures. And the oxen and the young asses, which work the land, salted mash will they eat, which is winnowed with the winnowing shovel and winnowing fork! And upon every high mountain, and every hill that rises high, there are springs, brooks in the day of the great massacre, when the towers fall." The blessing which the prophet depicts is the reverse of the day of judgment, and stands in the foreground when the judgment is past. The expression "in that day" fixes, as it were, the evening of the day of judgment, which is followed by the depicted morning of blessing. But the great mass of the Jewish nation would be first of all murdered in war; the towers must fall, i.e., (though without any figure, and merely as an exemplifying expression) all the bulwarks of self-confidence, self-help, and pride (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-15.htm">Isaiah 2:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-9.htm">Micah 5:9-10</a>). In the place of the self-induced calamities of war, there would now come the God-given rich blessings of peace; and in the place of the proud towers, there would come fruitful heights abounding with water. The field would be cultivated again, and produce luxuriant crops of nutritious corn; so that not only the labour of man, but that of the animals also, would receive a rich reward. "Rain to thy seed:" this is the early rain commencing about the middle of October. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; as an accusative, &#1494;&#1512;&#1506; being construed with a double accusative, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-9.htm">Deuteronomy 22:9</a>. &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; might be the singular, so far as the form is concerned (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-30.htm">Isaiah 1:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>); but, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-3.htm">Exodus 17:3</a>, it must be taken as a plural, like &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;. The 'a&#774;la&#770;ph&#305;&#772;m are the oxen used in ploughing and threshing; the &#8219;a&#774;ya&#770;r&#305;&#772;m, the asses used for carrying manure, soil, the sheaves, or the grain. Bel&#305;&#772;l cha&#770;m&#305;&#772;ts is a mash (composed of oats, barley, and vetches, or things of that kind) made more savoury with salt and sour vegetables;<p>(Note: Such as Salsola kali, Salsola tragus, Salsola soda, and other plants of the family of the chenopodiaceae.)<p>that is to say, a farrago (from ba&#770;lal, to mix; Comm. on Job, at <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/40-19.htm">Job 40:19-24</a>). According to Wetzstein, it is ripe barley (unthreshed during the harvest and threshing time, and the grain itself for the rest of the year) mixed with salt or salt vegetables. In any case, bel&#305;&#772;l is to be understood as referring to the grain; this is evident from the relative clause, "which has been winnowed" ( equals  mezo&#772;reh, Ewald, 169, d), or perhaps more correctly, "which he (one) winnows" (part. kal), the participle standing for the third person, with the subject contained within itself (Ewald, 200), i.e., not what was generally given from economy, viz., barley, etc., mixed with chopped straw (tibn), but pure grain (habb mahd, as they say at the present day). Rachath is a winnowing shovel, which is still used, according to Wetzstein, in Merj. Gedur, and Hauran; mizreh, on the other hand, is the winnowing fork with six prongs. Dainty food, such as was only given occasionally to the cattle, as something especially strengthening, would then be their regular food, and would be prepared in the most careful manner. "Who cannot see," exclaims Vitringa, "that this is to be taken spiritually?" He appeals to what Paul says in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-9.htm">1 Corinthians 9:9</a>, viz., that God does not trouble Himself about oxen. But Paul did not mean this in the same sense as Aristotle, who maintained that the minima were entirely excluded from the providence of God. What the Scriptures say concerning cattle, they do not say for the sake of the cattle, but for the sake of men; though it does not follow that the cattle are to be understood figuratively, as representing men. And this is the case here. What the prophet paints in this idyllic style, in colours furnished by the existing customs,<p>(Note: Asses particularly, even those of a guest, are generally very much neglected. The host throws them a little grass, and then hangs up the fodder-sack full of chopped straw; and it is a sign of extraordinary hospitality of corn is given to the asses as well as to the horses. - Wetzstein.)<p>is not indeed intended to be understood in the letter; and yet it is to be taken literally. In the age of glory, even on this side of eternity, a gigantic stride will be taken forward towards the glorification of universal nature, and towards the end of all those sighs which are so discernible now, more especially among domestic animals. The prophecy is therefore to be interpreted according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19</a>.; from which we may clearly see that God does trouble Himself about the sighing of an ox or ass that is overburdened with severe toil, and sometimes left to starve. </body></html>
