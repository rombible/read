Amon., translated in <span class= "ital">Records of the Past, ii.</span> 84, gives it in the self-same words (“many shall turn their backs on a few; and one shall rout a thousand”) as his boast of the strength of Egypt, may have given a special touch of sarcasm to Isaiah’s words.<p><span class= "bld">As a beacon upon the top of a mountain.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">as a pine. </span>As with a poet’s eye, the prophet paints two of the most striking emblems of solitariness: the tall pine standing by itself on the mountain height, the flag-staff seen alone far off against the sky.

They had the light, but they loved darkness rather. The prophets checked them in their sinful pursuits, so that they could not proceed without fear; this they took amiss. But faithful ministers will not be driven from seeking to awaken sinners. God is the Holy One of Israel, and so they shall find him. They did not like to hear of his holy commandments and his hatred of sin; they desired that they might no more be reminded of these things. But as they despised the word of God, their sins undermined their safety. Their state would be dashed in pieces like a potter's vessel. Let us return from our evil ways, and settle in the way of duty; that is the way to be saved. Would we be strengthened, it must be in quietness and in confidence, keeping peace in our own minds, and relying upon God. They think themselves wiser than God; but the project by which they thought to save themselves was their ruin. Only here and there one shall escape, as a warning to others. If men will not repent, turn to God, and seek happiness in his favour and service, their desires will but hasten their ruin. Those who make God alone their confidence, will have comfort. God ever waits to be gracious to all that come to him by faith in Christ, and happy are those who wait for him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>One thousand ... - The sense of this is, that you shall be easily alarmed and overcome by those who are inferior in numbers and strength. The number 'one thousand,' is put for a large indefinite number; probably meaning all.<p>At the rebuke of one - The number one here is put to denote a very small number; a number in the ordinary course of warfare entirely disproportionate to those who would be vanquished. There is probably a reference here to the prediction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a> :<p>How should one chase a thousand,<p>And two put ten thousand to flight,<p>Except their Rock had sold them<p>And Yahweh had shut them up?<p>At the rebuke of five - Of a very small number.<p>Till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain - The word rendered 'beacon' (&#1514;&#1512;&#1503;  toren), (Greek &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  histos, "a mast"), denotes properly the mast of a ship <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-23.htm">Isaiah 33:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-5.htm">Ezekiel 27:5</a>; then anything resembling a mast, a flagstaff, or a beacon of any kind. It may refer to a staff or mast erected on a promontory to warn sailors, or to be a landmark - as it is not improbable that the masts of ships would be employed for that purpose; or it may refer to a flagstaff, erected on a conspicuous place, to which the nation could rally in time of war. On the sea coasts of America such beacons are often erected. Those which I have seen consist of a pole erected on an eminence or rising ground, with a cask or barrel painted white on the top. The idea seems to be, that of a long pole erected for any purpose, and which was standing alone, stripped of its leaves and branches, and without ornament. So would be the few, solitary, and scattered Jews when driven before their enemies.<p>And as an ensign on a hill - (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-26.htm">Isaiah 5:26</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>, note). The idea is, that those who should escape would be few in number, and would stand alone, as a beacon in view of all the nations, to admonish them of the justice of God, and the truth of his threatening - like an ensign floating on a hill that can be seen from afar. What a striking description is this of the condition of the Jews in our times, and indeed in all ages since their dispersion! Their strength, and influence, and power as a people are gone. They stand as beacons to warn the nations of the evils of a want of confidence in God, and of his justice. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

The remnant of Jews left would be beacons to warn all men of the justice of God, and the truth of His threatenings. Gesenius (from Le 26:8; De 32:30) arbitrarily inserts "ten thousand."

A troop of horse, consisting of a thousand men, shall flee upon the attack and onset of a single person, so dispirited should they be, and so possessed of the fear of the enemy; what was promised to them with respect to their enemies is here turned against them, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-7.htm">Leviticus 26:7</a>, <p>at the rebuke of five shall ye flee; being attacked by a very small number, the whole army should run away: this denotes with what ease they should be routed, and put to flight; and is to be understood, not of what would be at the present time, but of what should come to pass hereafter, when the Chaldean army should come against them; <p>till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain; or, "as the mast of a ship", so the Septuagint and other versions. Jarchi says it signifies a high tree, or tall piece of wood fixed in the earth, like a ship's mast (p), set up to give warning of an enemy's approach, and when, and where, sometimes fires used to be kindled; hence the Targum is, <p>"till ye are left as a burning torch on the top of a mountain.'' <p>The Syriac version renders it, "as a wild ass", solitary and alone: <p>and as an ensign on a hill; erected as a trophy of victory. The design of the metaphors is to show that there should be few that should escape falling into the enemy's hand, here and there one, that should he scattered about, and be very thin, as beacons and signs are, and should be warnings to others of pursuing the same foolish and sinful methods and practices. <p>(p) So Ben Melech says, it is a high piece of wood in a ship, on which they hang an ensign or flag; and so he interprets the ensign in the next clause of a veil, so called, because they lift it up upon the mast. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/30.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">One thousand <i>shall flee</i> at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> top of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.</span><p>(p) Whereas all the trees are cut down save two or three to make masts.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/30.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. Their flight will be disgraceful.

But this interpretation does violence to the terms of the verse, which is really the introduction of a new section, full of glorious promises. The “waiting” of Jehovah is that of anxious expectancy for the opportune moment of intervention; His “exaltation” denotes His readiness to act. The emendation “he will be silent” for “he will be exalted” is unnecessary.

The new passage seems to belong to a different time, and to continue another train of thought: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/29-15.htm" title="Woe to them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who sees us? and who knows us?...">Isaiah 29:15-24</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a God of judgment</span>] or “justice.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that wait for him</span>] Cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-17.htm" title="And I will wait on the LORD, that hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.">Isaiah 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-20.htm" title="Our soul waits for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.">Psalm 33:20</a>, &c.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one</span>.

"For it is a refractory people, lying children, children who do not like to hear the instruction of Jehovah, who say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things! Speak flatteries to us! Get out of the way, turn aside from the path, remove from our face the Holy One of Israel." On the expression &#8219;am mer&#305;&#772; (a people of stubbornness), see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-8.htm">Isaiah 3:8</a>. The vowel-pointing of &#1499;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; follows the same rule as that of &#1492;&#1495;&#1499;&#1501;. The prophet traces back their words to an unvarnished expression of their true meaning, just as he does in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-15.htm">Isaiah 28:15</a>. They forbid the prophets of Jehovah to prophesy, more especially nekho&#772;cho&#772;th, straight or true things (things not agreeable to their own wishes), but would rather hear cha&#774;la&#770;qo&#772;th, i.e., smooth, insinuating, and flattering things, and even maha&#774;thallo&#772;th (from ha&#770;thal, Talm. tal, ludere), i.e., illusions or deceits. Their desire was to be entertained and lauded, not repelled and instructed. The prophets are to adopt another course (&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; only occurs here, and that twice, instead of the more usual &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;  equals  &#1502;&#1503;, after the form &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;, &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;), and not trouble them any more with the Holy One of Israel, whom they (at least Isaiah, who is most fond of calling Jehovah by this name) have always in their mouths. </body></html>
