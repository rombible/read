This was in part fulfilled upon their return from Babylon, “when the tears which they had shed in their banishment were wiped away, and God heard the prayers and vows of his people, after the time of his indignation was expired.” But it was more fully accomplished in the times of the gospel, when many of them were, and the whole body of them shall be, brought into Christ’s church, often called Zion and Jerusalem.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:19-26 God's people will soon arrive at the Zion above, and then they will weep no more for ever. Even now they would have more comfort, as well as holiness, if they were more constant in prayer. A famine of bread is not so great a judgment as a famine of the word of God. There are right-hand and left-hand errors; the tempter is busy courting us into by-paths. It is happy if, by the counsels of a faithful minister or friend, or the checks of conscience, and the strivings of God the Spirit, we are set right when doubting, and prevented from going wrong. They shall be cured of their idolatry. To all true penitents sin becomes very hateful. This is shown daily in the conversion of souls, by the power of Divine grace, to the fear and love of God. Abundant means of grace, with the influences of the Holy Spirit, would be extended to places destitute of them. The effect of this should be comfort and joy to the people of God. Light, that is, knowledge, shall increase. This is the light which the gospel brought into the world, and which proclaims healing to the broken-hearted.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the people shall dwell in Zion - (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>). The language here is evidently adapted to a return from the captivity. The whole design of the passage <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-19.htm">Isaiah 30:19-26</a> is to describe a future state of prosperity by images mainly drawn from the idea of temporal enjoyment. The sense is, that in some period subsequent to the calamities that would befall them for their improper reliance on the aid of Egypt <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-16.htm">Isaiah 30:16-17</a>, there would be prosperity, peace, and joy in Jerusalem. The order of events, as seen by the prophet in vision, seems to be this. He sees the people threatened with an invasion by Sennacherib. He sees them forget their reliance on God and seek the aid of Egypt. He sees, as a consequence of this, a long series of calamities resulting in the downfall of the republic, the destruction of the city, and the captivity at Babylon. Yet he sees, in the distant prospect, prosperity, happiness, security, piety, the blessing of God, and rich and abundant future mercies resting on his people. That the blessings under the Messiah constitute a part of this "series" of mercies no one can doubt who attentively considers the language in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-25.htm">Isaiah 30:25-26</a>.<p>Thou shalt weep no more - (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>).<p>He will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry - When in your calamities you shall cry unto him for deliverance, he shall hear you, and restore you to your own land. This is in accordance with the statements in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-8.htm">Isaiah 26:8-9</a> (see the notes at these verses), that in their captivity in Babylon they would seek God.<p>He will answer thee - (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-12.htm">Jeremiah 29:12-14</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.

Or, "for the people of Zion (z) shall dwell in Jerusalem"; those that belonged to the fort of Zion should dwell in Jerusalem, or "abide" there, both they and the inhabitants of it, at least many of them should quietly continue there, waiting the Lord's time to appear for them, and not run here and there, and particularly to Egypt for help or shelter. Seeing there are many things in the following verses which have respect to Gospel times, and best suit with them, this may be understood of the safe and comfortable dwelling of the children of Zion, or regenerate persons, in a Gospel church state, which is often called Jerusalem, both in the Old and New Testament: <p>thou shalt weep no more; or, "in weeping thou shall not weep" (a); though they had been weeping because of the enemy's invasion of their land, and besieging their city, yet now all tears should be wiped away from their eyes, being delivered from him; this may very well be accommodated to Gospel times: <p>he will be very gracious unto thee, at the voice of thy cry; these are the words of the prophet, declaring that the Lord would be gracious to his people at the voice of their prayer and supplication to him in their distress, as he was to the voice of Hezekiah's cry and supplication to him: <p>when he shall hear it, he will answer thee; he always hears the prayers of his people, and he always answers them, sooner or later, in his own time, and in his own way; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-24.htm">Isaiah 65:24</a>. <p>(z)  "polpulus Sion", V.

"Therefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye dislike this word, and put your trust in force and shufflings, and rely upon this; therefore will this iniquity be to you like a falling breach, bent forwards in a high-towering wall, which falls to ruin suddenly, very suddenly. And He smites it to pieces, as a potter's vessel falls to pieces, when they smash it without sparing, and of which, when it lies smashed to pieces there, you cannot find a sherd to fetch fire with from the hearth, or to take water with out of a cistern." The "word" towards which they cherished me'o&#772;s (read mo'oskhem), was the word of Jehovah through His prophet, which was directed against their untheocratic policy of reckoning upon Egypt. Na&#770;lo&#772;z, bent out or twisted, is the term used to denote this very policy, which was ever resorting to bypaths and secret ways; whilst &#8219;o&#772;sheq denotes the squeezing out of the money required to carry on the war of freedom, and to purchase the help of Egypt (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-20.htm">2 Kings 15:20</a>). The guilt of Judah is compared to the broken and overhanging part of a high wall (nibh&#8219;eh, bent forwards; compare (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;, a term applied to a diseased swelling). Just as such a broken piece brings down the whole of the injured wall along with it, so would the sinful conduct of Judah immediately ruin the whole of its existing constitution. Israel, which would not recognise itself as the image of Jehovah, even when there was yet time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-16.htm">Isaiah 29:16</a>), would be like a vessel smashed into the smallest fragments. It is the captivity which is here figuratively threatened by the prophet; for the smashing had regard to Israel as a state. The subject to &#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-14.htm">Isaiah 30:14</a> is Jehovah, who would make use of the hostile power of man to destroy the wall, and break up the kingdom of Judah into such a diaspora of broken sherds. The reading is not &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492;&#1468; (lxx, Targum), but &#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492;&#1468;, et franget eam. Ka&#770;tho&#772;th is an infinitive statement of the mode; the participle ka&#770;thu&#772;th, which is adopted by the Targum, Kimchi, Norzi, and others, is less suitable. It was necessary to proceed with &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1500; &#1500;&#1488; (without his sparing), simply because the infinitive absolute cannot be connected with &#1500;&#1488; (Ewald, 350, a). &#1500;&#1495;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1493;&#1507; (to be written thus with dagesh both here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-16.htm">Haggai 2:16</a>) passes from the primary meaning nudare to that of scooping up, as &#1506;&#1512;&#1492; does to that of pouring out. </body></html>
