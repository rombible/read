Even that had, for God’s true servants, been the beginning of blessings, but this was but the earnest of a more glorious future. Isaiah reasons as St. Paul does.

Even now they would have more comfort, as well as holiness, if they were more constant in prayer. A famine of bread is not so great a judgment as a famine of the word of God. There are right-hand and left-hand errors; the tempter is busy courting us into by-paths. It is happy if, by the counsels of a faithful minister or friend, or the checks of conscience, and the strivings of God the Spirit, we are set right when doubting, and prevented from going wrong. They shall be cured of their idolatry. To all true penitents sin becomes very hateful. This is shown daily in the conversion of souls, by the power of Divine grace, to the fear and love of God. Abundant means of grace, with the influences of the Holy Spirit, would be extended to places destitute of them. The effect of this should be comfort and joy to the people of God. Light, that is, knowledge, shall increase. This is the light which the gospel brought into the world, and which proclaims healing to the broken-hearted.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Moreover - In addition to all the blessings which are enumerated above.<p>The light of the moon - Light is in the Scriptures an emblem of purity, intelligence, happiness, prosperity; as darkness is an emblem of ignorance, calamity, and sin. This figure is often used by the poets. Thus Horace:<p>Soles melius nitent.<p>Carm. liv.: Od. v. 8.<p>The figure of augmenting light to denote the blessings of religion, and especially of the gospel, is often employed by Isaiah (compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-5.htm">Isaiah 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-17.htm">Isaiah 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-10.htm">Isaiah 58:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-19.htm">Isaiah 60:19-20</a>). The sense of this passage is, that in those future days the light would shine intensely, and without obscurity; that though they had been walking in the light of the true religion, yet that their light would be greatly augmented, and that they would have much clearer views of the divine character and government. That this refers to the times of the Messiah there can be little or no room to doubt. It is language such as Isaiah commonly employs to describe those times; and there is a fullness and splendor about it which can suit no other period. There is nothing in the connection, moreover, which forbids such an interpretation of the passage.<p>Shall be as the light of the sun - Shall be clear, bright, intense. The sense is, there shall be a great increase of light, as if the light of the moon were suddenly increased to the brightness of the meridian sun.<p>Shall be seven-fold - Seven times as intense and clear as usual, as if the light of seven days were concentrated into one. The word 'seven' in the Scriptures often denotes a complete or perfect number; and indicates "completeness" or "perfections." The phrase 'as the light of seven days,' Lowth supposes is a gloss which has been introduced into the text from the margin. The reasons which he adduces for this supposition are, that it is missing in the Septuagint, and that it interrupts the rhythmical construction. But this is not sufficient authority for rejecting the words from the text. No authority of MSS. is adduced for thus rejecting them, and they are found in the Vulgate, the Chaldee, and the Syriac. They are missing, however, in the Arabic.<p>In the day - Vitringa supposes that this refers to the time of the Maccabees; but although there may be a reference to that time, yet the idea is evidently designed to include the future times of the Messiah. The sense of the prophet is, that subsequent to the great calamities which were to befall them, there would be a time of glorious prosperity, and the design of this was to comfort them with the assurance that their nation would not be wholly destroyed.<p>Bindeth up the breach of his people - Or the wound. The calamity that should come upon them is thus represented as a wound inflicted on them by the stripes of punishment (see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-5.htm">Isaiah 1:5</a>). Yahweh would heal it by restoring them to their own land, and to their former privileges. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. Image from the heavenly bodies to express the increase of spiritual light and felicity. "Sevenfold" implies the perfection of that felicity, seven being the sacred number.

And this exposition seems the more probable, because it is the manner of the prophets, and especially of this, who is rightly called the <span class="ital">evangelical prophet</span>, to take all occasions to speak of the days of the Messiah, and of the blessed privileges of that time and state of the church, among which they constantly reckon light, whether you take it for knowledge or for comfort, to be one. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound; </span> when God shall effectually cure the wounds and breaches of his people, first making up the breach between him and them, then making Israel and Judah to be one, who now are sadly divided; and making Jew and Gentile to be one fold under one Shepherd, even the Messiah, which the prophets foretell that it shall be in the times of the gospel. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun,.... An hyperbolical expression, used to set forth the exceeding great light of the Gospel under the dispensation of it, which would as far exceed the light of the former dispensation, comparable to the moon, as the light of the sun exceeds the light of the moon; as also that great degree of spiritual joy and comfort that should be in those times, especially in the latter day; and the Jews themselves apply this to the times of the Messiah, and to the times after the war of Gog and Magog, after which they say there will be no more sorrow and distress; so Kimchi; and to these times it is applied in the Talmud (h); and Aben Ezra says, that all interpreters understand it of the time to come: <p>and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days; as if the light of seven days was collected together; or as if there were seven suns shining together. The Targum and Jarchi not only make it to be seven times seven, that is, forty nine; but multiply forty nine by seven, and make it three hundred and forty three, or as the light of so many days. Maimonides (i) thinks it has respect to the seven days of the dedication of the temple in Solomon's time, when the people never had such glory, felicity, and joy, as at that time: with this compare the light of the New Jerusalem state, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a>, <p>in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound; not only peace being made, by the blood of Christ, between God and his people, and they healed by his stripes, and Jew and Gentile reconciled in one body on his cross, and through the preaching of the Gospel; but as will be in the latter day, the fulness of the Gentiles will be brought in, and all Israel shall be saved; and all the Lord's people will be one in his hands, and be entirely freed from all grievances and afflictions by the man of sin, who will now be destroyed, and also will be in a sound and healthful state and condition.

"For a people continues dwelling in Zion, in Jerusalem; thou shalt not weep for ever: He will prove Himself gracious to thee at the sound of thy cry for help; as soon as He hears, He answers thee. And the Lord giveth you bread in penury, and water for your need; and thy teachers will not hide themselves any more, and thine eyes come to see thy teachers. And thine ears will hear words behind thee, saying, 'This is the way, walk ye in it!' whether ye turn to the right hand or to the left. And ye defile the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the clothing of thy molten images of gold; thou wilt scatter them like filthy thing: 'Get out!' thou sayest to it." We do not render <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-19.htm">Isaiah 30:19</a>, "For O people that dwelleth in Zion, in Jerusalem!" For although the personal pronoun may be omitted after Vav in an apostrophizing connection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-5.htm">Proverbs 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23</a>), we should certainly expect to find &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; here. The accent very properly marks these words as forming an independent clause. The apparent tautology in the expression, "in Zion, in Jerusalem," is emphatic and explanatory. The fate of Zion-Jerusalem will not be the same as that of the imperial city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-2.htm">Isaiah 25:2</a>); for it is the city of Jehovah, which, according to His promise, cannot become an eternally deserted ruin. After this promising declaration, the prophet turns and addresses the people of the future in the people of his own time; ba&#770;kho&#772; strengthens the verbal notion with the mark of duration; cha&#770;no&#772;n with the mark of certainty and fulness. &#1497;&#1495;&#1504;&#1498;, with an advanced o&#774;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-29.htm">Genesis 43:29</a>, for &#1497;&#1495;&#1503;. &#1499;&#1468; is the shortest expression used to denote simultaneous occurrence; answering and hearing would coincide (shom&#8219;a&#770;h, nomen actionis, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-9.htm">Isaiah 47:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-2.htm">Isaiah 55:2</a>; Ges. 45, 1b; &#8219;a&#770;na&#770;kh, the pausal form here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-37.htm">Jeremiah 23:37</a>). From this lowest stage of response to the penitential cry for help, the promise rises higher and higher. The next stage is that in which Jerusalem is brought into all the distress consequent upon a siege, as threatened by the prophet in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-3.htm">Isaiah 29:3-4</a>; the besieged would not be allowed by God to die of starvation, but He would send them the necessary support. The same expression, but very little altered, viz., "to give to eat lechem lachatz u&#772;mayim lachatz," signifies to put any one upon the low rations of a siege or of imprisonment, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-27.htm">1 Kings 22:27</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-26.htm">2 Chronicles 18:26</a>; but here it is a promise, with the threat kept in the background. &#1510;&#1512; and &#1500;&#1495;&#1509; are connected with the absolute nouns &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; and &#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, not as adverbial, but as appositional definitions (like &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1497;&#1497;&#1503;, "wine which is giddiness," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-5.htm">Psalm 60:5</a>; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, "water which is knees," i.e., which has the measure of the knees, where birkayim is also in apposition, and not the accusative of measurement): literally, bread which is necessity, and water which is affliction; that is to say, nourishment of which there is extreme need, the very opposite of bread and water in abundance. Umbreit and Drechsler understand this spiritually. But the promise rises as it goes on. There is already an advance, in the fact that the faithful and well-meaning teachers (mo&#772;r&#305;&#772;m) no longer keep themselves hidden because of the hard-heartedness and hatred of the people, as they have done ever since the time of Ahaz (&#1504;&#1499;&#1504;&#1507;, a denom.: to withdraw into &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1507;, &#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;, the utmost end, the most secret corner; though ka&#770;naph in itself signifies to cover or conceal). Israel, when penitent, would once more be able to rejoice in the sight of those whom it longed to have back again. &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; is a plural, according to the context (on the singular of the previous predicate, see Ges. 147). As the shepherds of the flock, they would follow the people with friendly words of admonition, whilst the people would have their ears open to receive their instruction. &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is here equivalent to &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;. The abominations of idolatry (which continued even in the first years of Hezekiah's reign: <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-7.htm">Isaiah 31:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-5.htm">Micah 1:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-11.htm">Micah 5:11-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-16.htm">Micah 6:16</a>) would now be regarded as abominations, and put away. Even gold and silver, with which the images that were either carved or cast in inferior metal were overlaid, would be made unclean (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/28-8.htm">2 Kings 28:8</a>ff.); that is to say, no use would be made of them. Da&#770;va&#770;h is a shorter expression for kel&#305;&#772; da&#770;va&#770;h, the cloth worn by a woman at the monthly period. On za&#770;ra&#770;h, to dispense - to which da&#770;va&#770;h would be inappropriate if understood of the woman herself, as it is by Luzzatto - compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-6.htm">2 Kings 23:6</a>. With &#1494;&#1492;&#1489;&#1498;, the plural used in the general address passes over into the individualizing singular; &#1500;&#1493; is to be taken as a neuter pointing back to the plunder of idols. </body></html>
