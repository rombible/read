The world is a fruitless, worthless wilderness; but the church is a vineyard, a place that has great care taken of it, and from which precious fruits are gathered. God will keep it in the night of affliction and persecution, and in the day of peace and prosperity, the temptations of which are not less dangerous. God also takes care of the fruitfulness of this vineyard. We need the continual waterings of Divine grace; if these be at any time withdrawn, we wither, and come to nothing. Though God sometimes contends with his people, yet he graciously waits to be reconciled unto them. It is true, when he finds briers and thorns instead of vines, and they are set in array against him, he will tread them down and burn them. Here is a summary of the doctrine of the gospel, with which the church is to be watered every moment. Ever since sin first entered, there has been, on God's part, a righteous quarrel, but, on man's part, most unrighteous. Here is a gracious invitation given. Pardoning mercy is called the power of our Lord; let us take hold on that. Christ crucified is the power of God. Let us by lively faith take hold on his strength who is a strength to the needy, believing there is no other name by which we can be saved, as a man that is sinking catches hold of a bough, or cord, or plank, that is in his reach. This is the only way, and it is a sure way, to be saved. God is willing to be reconciled to us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sing ye unto her - That is, sing unto, or respecting the vineyard. The word rendered 'sing' (&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;  &#8219;anu&#770;) signifies properly, "answer, respond to;" and then, sing a responsive song, where one portion of the choir responds to another (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-21.htm">Exodus 15:21</a>). This has been well expressed here by Lowth in his translation:<p>'To the beloved Vineyard, sing ye a responsive song.'<p>It is the commencement of a song, or hymn respecting Judea, represented under the image of a vineyard, and which is probably confirmed to the close of the chapter.<p>A vineyard - (see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a> ff) The Hebrew phrase rendered 'a vineyard of red wine' is the title to the song; or the responsive song respects the 'vineyard of red wine.'<p>Of red wine - (&#1495;&#1502;&#1512;  chemer). Lowth proposes to read instead of this, &#1495;&#1502;&#1491;  chemed, pleasantness, beauty, or beloved." He observes that many manuscripts have this meaning, and that it is followed by the Septuagint and the Chaldee. The Septuagint reads it: &#x391;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  Ampelo&#772;n kallos - 'Beautiful vineyard.' This would well suit the connection, and this slight error in transcribing might have easily occurred. But the authority in the manuscripts for the change is not conclusive. The word which now occurs in the text denotes properly "wine," from &#1495;&#1502;&#1512;  cha&#770;mar, to "ferment." The word &#1495;&#1502;&#1512;  cha&#770;mar also has the signification "to be red" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-9.htm">Psalm 75:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-16.htm">Job 16:16</a>; and according to this, our translators have rendered it 'of red wine.' Bochart (Geog. Sac. ii. 1, 29) renders it, 'A vineyard fertile in producing wine.' The correct translation would be one that would not seem very congruous in our language, 'a vineyard of wine,' or 'a wine-vineyard.' <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

The verse probably runs thus: <span class="bld">In that day</span>—“<span class="bld">Pleasant vineyard!

But a few MSS.

For the phrase see <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-11.htm" title="For as much therefore as your treading is on the poor, and you take from him burdens of wheat: you have built houses of hewn stone, but you shall not dwell in them; you have planted pleasant vineyards, but you shall not drink wine of them.">Amos 5:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">2–6</span>.

This piece may be called a companion picture to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>, or a joy-song to be set over against that dirge. In both the figure of the vineyard is employed to express the people of God, and God is "the Lord of the vineyard." But whereas, on the former occasion, all was wrath and fury, menace and judgment, here all is mercy and loving-kindness, protection and promise. The difference is, no doubt, not with God, "with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>), but with the vineyard, which is either not the same, or, if the same, then differently circumstanced. The vineyard of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5</a>. is beyond all doubt the Jewish Church in the time of Isaiah, or in the times shortly after. The vineyard of the present place is either the Christian Church, or the Jewish Church reformed and purified by suffering. It is not the Church triumphant in heaven, since  there are still "briars and thorns" in it, and there are still those belonging to it who have to "make their peace with God." The prophet has come back from his investigations of the remote future and the supra-mundane sphere to something which belongs to earth, and perhaps not to a very distant period. His second "song of the vineyard" may well comfort the Church through all her earthly struggles. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sing ye unto her</span>. Our translators have, strangely enough, inverted the order of the two clauses, which stand thus in the Hebrew: "A vineyard of red wine; sing ye unto it, "or "sing ye of it." The "vineyard of red wine" is one that produces abundance of rich fruit. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The tephilla&#770;h now returns to the retrospective glance already cast in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-8.htm">Isaiah 26:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-9.htm">Isaiah 26:9</a> into that night of affliction, which preceded the redemption that had come. "Jehovah, in trouble they missed Thee, poured out light supplication when Thy chastisement came upon them. As a woman with child, who draws near to her delivery, writhes and cries out in her pangs, so were we in Thy sight, O Jehovah. We went with child, we writhed; it was as if we brought forth wind. We brought no deliverance to the land, and the inhabitants of the world did not come to the light." The substantive circumstantial clause in the parallel line, &#1500;&#1502;&#1493; &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;, castigatione tua eos affilgente (&#1500; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-9.htm">Isaiah 26:9</a>), corresponds to &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;; and &#1500;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473; &#1510;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, a preterite &#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511; etire  equals  &#1497;&#1510;&#1511;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-2.htm">Job 28:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/29-6.htm">Job 29:6</a>, to be poured out and melt away) with Nun paragogic (which is only met with again in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-16.htm">Deuteronomy 8:16</a>, the yeko&#772;shu&#772;n in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-21.htm">Isaiah 29:21</a> being, according to the syntax, the future of ko&#772;sh), answers to pa&#770;kad, which is used here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-16.htm">Isaiah 34:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-6.htm">1 Samuel 20:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-15.htm">1 Samuel 25:15</a>, in the sense of lustrando desiderare. Lachash is a quiet, whispering prayer (like the whispering of forms of incantation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-3.htm">Isaiah 3:3</a>); sorrow renders speechless in the long run; and a consciousness of sin crushes so completely, that a man does not dare to address God aloud (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-4.htm">Isaiah 29:4</a>). Pregnancy and pangs are symbols of a state of expectation strained to the utmost, the object of which appears all the closer the more the pains increase. Often, says the perfected church, as it looks back upon its past history, often did we regard the coming of salvation as certain; but again and again were our hopes deceived. The first &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493; is equivalent to &#1499;&#1468;, "as a woman with child," etc. (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-22.htm">Isaiah 8:22</a>); the second is equivalent to &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, "as it were, we brought forth wind." This is not an inverted expression, signifying we brought forth as it were wind; but &#1499;&#1502;&#1493; governs the whole sentence in the sense of "(it was) as if." The issue of all their painful toil was like the result of a false pregnancy (empneumatosis), a delivery of wind. This state of things also proceeded from Jehovah, as the expression "before Thee" implies. It was a consequence of the sins of Israel, and of a continued want of true susceptibility to the blessings of salvation. Side by side with their disappointed hope, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-18.htm">Isaiah 26:18</a> places the ineffectual character of their won efforts. Israel's own doings - no, they could never make the land into &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; (i.e., bring it into a state of complete salvation); and (so might the final clause be understood) they waited in vain for the judgment of Jehovah upon the sinful world that was at enmity against them, or they made ineffectual efforts to overcome it. This explanation is favoured by the fact, that throughout the whole of this cycle of prophecies yo&#772;shbe&#772; te&#772;be&#772;l does not mean the inhabitants of the holy land, but of the globe at large in the sense of "the world" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-21.htm">Isaiah 26:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-5.htm">Isaiah 24:5-6</a>). Again, the relation of &#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; to the &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>, land the figure previously employed of the pains of child-birth, speak most strongly in favour of the conclusion, that na&#770;phal is here used for the falling of the fruit of the womb (cf., Wis. 7:3, Il. xix. 110, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; and &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;). And yo&#772;shbe&#772; te&#772;be&#772;l (the inhabitants of the world) fits in with this sense (viz., that the expected increase of the population never came), from the fact that in this instance the reference is not to the inhabitants of the earth; but the words signify inhabitants generally, or, as we should say, young, new-born "mortals." The punishment of the land under the weight of the empire still continued, and a new generation did not come to the light of day to populate the desolate land (cf., Psychol. p. 414). </body></html>
