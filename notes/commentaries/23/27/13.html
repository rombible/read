It re-appears in the Apocalyptic eschatology of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-31.htm" title="And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.">Matthew 24:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-52.htm" title="In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.">1Corinthians 15:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm" title="For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:">1Thessalonians 4:16</a>, standing there, as here, for any great event that heralds the fulfilment of a Divine purpose. That purpose, in this instance, is the proclamation of the Year of Redemption, the restoration of the dispersed of Israel from the countries of their exile, of which, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-11.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.">Isaiah 11:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-23.htm" title="In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.">Isaiah 19:23</a>, Assyria and Egypt are the two chief representatives.

May our souls be continually watered and kept, that we may abound in the fruits of the Spirit, in all goodness, righteousness, and truth. The Jews yet are kept a separate and a numerous people; they have not been rooted out as those who slew them. The condition of that nation, through so many ages, forms a certain proof of the Divine origin of the Scriptures; and the Jews live amongst us, a continued warning against sin. But though winds are ever so rough, ever so high, God can say to them, Peace, be still. And though God will afflict his people, yet he will make their afflictions to work for the good of their souls. According to this promise, since the captivity in Babylon, no people have shown such hatred to idols and idolatry as the Jews. And to all God's people, the design of affliction is to part between them and sin. The affliction has done us good, when we keep at a distance from the occasions of sin, and use care that we may not be tempted to it. Jerusalem had been defended by grace and the Divine protection; but when God withdrew, she was left like a wilderness. This has awfully come to pass. And this is a figure of the deplorable state of the vineyard, the church, when it brought forth wild grapes. Sinners flatter themselves they shall not be dealt with severely, because God is merciful, and is their Maker. We see how weak those pleas will be. Verses 12,13, seem to predict the restoration of the Jews after the Babylonish captivity, and their recovery from their present dispersion. This is further applicable to the preaching of the gospel, by which sinners are gathered into the grace of God; the gospel proclaims the acceptable year of the Lord. Those gathered by the sounding of the gospel trumpet, are brought in to worship God, and added to the church; and the last trumpet will gather the saints together.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The great trumpet shall be blown - This verse is designed to describe in another mode the same fact as that stated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-12.htm">Isaiah 27:12</a>, that Yahweh would re-collect his scattered people. The figure is derived from the trumpet which was blown to assemble a people for war (Grotius); or from the blowing of the trumpet on occasion of the great feasts and festivals of the Jews (Vitringa). The idea is, that God would summon the scattered people to return to their own land. The "way" in which this was done, or in which the will of God would be made known to them, is not specified. It is probable, however, that the reference here is to the decree of Cyrus <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1</a>, by which they were permitted to return to their own country.<p>Which were ready to perish - Who were reduced in numbers, and in power, and who were ready to be annihilated under their accumulated and long-continued trials.<p>In the land of Assyria - The ten tribes were carried away into Assyria <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>; and it is probable that many of the other two tribes were also in that land. A portion of the ten tribes would also be re-collected, and would return with the others to the land of their fathers. Assyria also constituted a considerable part of the kingdom of the Chaldeans, and the name Assyria may be given here to that country in general.<p>And the outcasts - Those who had fled in consternation to Egypt and to other places when these calamities were coming upon the nation (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-17.htm">Jeremiah 41:17-18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-15.htm">Jeremiah 42:15-22</a>).<p>And shall worship the Lord - Their temple shall be rebuilt; their city shall be restored; and in the place where their fathers worshipped shall they also again adore the living God. This closes the prophecy which was commenced in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/24.htm">Isaiah 24</a>; and the design of the whole is to comfort the Jews with the assurance, that though they were to be made captive in a distant land, yet they would be again restored to the land of their fathers, and again worship God there. It is almost needless to say that this prediction was completely fulfilled by the return of the Jews to their own country under the decree of Cyrus. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. great trumpet&#8212;image from the trumpets blown on the first day of the seventh month to summon the people to a holy convocation (Le 23:24). Antitypically, the gospel trumpet (Re 11:15; 14:6) which the Jews shall hearken to in the last days (Zec 12:10; 13:1). As the passover in the first month answers to Christ's crucifixion, so the day of atonement and the idea of "salvation" connected with the feast of tabernacles in the same seventh month, answer to the crowning of "redemption" at His second coming; therefore redemption is put last in 1Co 1:30.<p>Assyria&#8212;whither the ten tribes had been carried; Babylonia is mainly meant, to which Assyria at that time belonged; the two tribes were restored, and some of the ten accompanied them.

And there, in the face of the glorious future which awaited Israel, the fact shines out brightly before his eyes, that the punishment which God inflicts upon Israel is a very different thing from that inflicted upon the world. "Hath He smitten it like the smiting of its smiter, or is it slain like the slaying of those slain by Him? Thou punishedst it with measures, when thou didst thrust it away, sifting with violent breath in the day of the east wind." "Its smiter" (macce&#772;hu&#772;) is the imperial power by which Israel had been attacked (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>); and "those slain by Him" (&#1492;&#1512;&#1490;&#1497;&#1493;) are the slain of the empire who had fallen under the strokes of Jehovah. The former smote unmercifully, and its slain ones now lay without hope (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-14.htm">Isaiah 26:14</a>). Jehovah smites differently, and it is very different with the church, which has succumbed in the persons of its righteous members. For the double play upon words, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-18.htm">Isaiah 22:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-16.htm">Isaiah 10:16</a>. When Jehovah put Israel away (as if by means of a "bill of divorcement," <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-1.htm">Isaiah 50:1</a>), He strove against it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-25.htm">Isaiah 49:25</a>), i.e., punished it, "in measure," i.e., determining the measure very exactly, that it might not exceed the enduring power of Israel, not endanger the existence of Israel as a nation (cf., bemishpa&#770;t in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-24.htm">Jeremiah 10:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-28.htm">Jeremiah 46:28</a>). On the other hand, Hitzig, Ewald, and Knobel read &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1488;&#1505;&#1488;&#1492;, from a word &#1505;&#1488;&#1505;&#1488;,<p>(Note: Bttcher refers to a Talmudic word, &#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1488; (to remove), but this is to be pronounced &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488; ( equals  &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506;), and is moreover, very uncertain.)<p>related to &#1494;&#1506;&#1494;&#1506;, or even &#1496;&#1488;&#1496;&#1488;, "when thou didst disturb (or drive forth);" but the traditional text does not indicate any various reading with &#1492; mappic., and the ancient versions and expositors all take the word as a reduplication of &#1505;&#1488;&#1492;, which stands here as the third of an ephah to denote a moderately large measure. The clause ha&#770;ga&#770;h beru&#772;cho&#772; is probably regarded as an elliptical relative clause, in which case the transition to the third person can be best explained: "thou, who siftedst with violent breath." Ha&#770;ga&#770;h, which only occurs again in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-4.htm">Proverbs 25:4</a>, signifies to separate, e.g., the dross from silver (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>). Jehovah sifted Israel (compare the figure of the threshing-floor in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-10.htm">Isaiah 21:10</a>), at the time when, by suspending captivity over it, He blew as violently upon it as if the east wind had raged (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-1.htm">Job 2:1-13</a> :19). But He only sifted, He did not destroy. </body></html>
