The parable with which it opens has for us the interest of having obviously supplied a starting-point for a later prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-21.htm" title="Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then are you turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine to me?">Jeremiah 2:21</a>), and for our Lord’s teaching in the like parable of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/21-33.htm" title="Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and dig a wine press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to farmers, and went into a far country:">Matthew 21:33-41</a>. Here, however, there is the distinctive touch of the irony of the opening verse. The prophet presents himself, as it were, in the character of a minstrel, ready to sing to his hearers one of the love-songs in which their culture delighted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-5.htm" title="That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of music, like David;">Amos 6:5</a>.) In its language and rhythm it reminds us of the Song of Solomon. The very word “beloved” recalls <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/songs/5-1.htm" title="I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yes, drink abundantly, O beloved.">Song of Solomon 5:1-2</a>; the description of the vineyards, that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/songs/8-11.htm" title="Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard to keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.">Song of Solomon 8:11-13</a>. The probability that the parallelism was intentional is increased by the coincidence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-23.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand sliver coins, it shall even be for briers and thorns.">Isaiah 7:23</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/8-11.htm" title="Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard to keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.">Song of Solomon 8:11</a>, which will meet us further on. On this assumption Isaiah’s words have a special interest as showing how early that poem lent itself to a mystical interpretation. One might almost conjecture that the prophet allured the people to listen by music as well as words, and appeared, as Elisha and other prophets had done, with harp or pipe in hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-15.htm" title="But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came on him.">2Kings 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm" title="After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when you are come thither to the city, that you shall meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:">1Samuel 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-23.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was on Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.">1Samuel 16:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-29.htm" title="You shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.">Isaiah 30:29</a>). The frequency of such hymns (Isaiah 12, 25, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/26-1.htm" title="In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.">Isaiah 26:1-4</a>) shows, at any rate, that the prophet had received the training of a psalmist. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">A song of my beloved.</span>—A slightly different reading adopted by some critics gives <span class= "ital">A song of love. </span>The “beloved” is purposely not named, but appears afterwards as none other than Jehovah. The word, closely connected with the ideal name Jedediah (the beloved of Jehovah; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-25.htm" title="And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.">2Samuel 12:25</a>), occurs in twenty-six passages of Song of Sol., and not elsewhere.<p><span class= "bld">A very fruitful hill.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">a horn, the son of oil. </span>The combination “horn of oil” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Samuel, How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill your horn with oil, and go, I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.">1Samuel 16:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-13.htm" title="Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the middle of his brothers: and the Spirit of the LORD came on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.">1Samuel 16:13</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-39.htm" title="And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.">1Kings 1:39</a>, suggests the thought that the phrase is equivalent to “the horn of the anointed” (Kay). The term “horn” was a natural synonym for a hill. So we have Matterhorn, Aarhorn, &c., in the Alps. Oil was naturally symbolic of fertility. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/80-8.htm" title="You have brought a vine out of Egypt: you have cast out the heathen, and planted it.">Psalm 80:8-16</a>, we have a striking parallel. The “fruitful hill” was Canaan as a whole, with a special reference to Judah and Jerusalem. The “choicest vine”—literally, <span class= "ital">vine of Sorek </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-11.htm" title="Binding his foal to the vine, and his ass's colt to the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:">Genesis 49:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-21.htm" title="Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then are you turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine to me?">Jeremiah 2:21</a>), bearing a small dark purple grape—pointed back to the fathers of the nation, who, idealised in the retrospect, were as the heroes of faith compared with the then present generation. The picture which forms the parable might almost take its place among the <span class= "ital">Georgics </span>of Palestine. The vineyard on the hillside could not be ploughed, and therefore the stones had to be taken out by hand. It was fenced against the beasts of the field. There was a tower for a watchman to guard it against the attacks of robbers. (Comp. Virg. <span class= "ital">Georg. </span>ii. 399-419.) Each part has its own interpretation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-1.htm" title="Now will I sing to my well beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My well beloved has a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:">Isaiah 5:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now will I sing, </span>&c. — Bishop Lowth translates this clause, “Let me sing now a song to my beloved; a song of loves concerning his vineyard.” This is the exordium, a kind of title placed before the song; which song he records, as Moses did his, that it might be a witness for God, and against Israel. The <span class="ital">beloved, </span>to whom the prophet addresses the song, is the Lord of the vineyard, as appears by the latter clause of the verse, namely, God, or his Messiah, whom the prophet loved and served, and for whose glory, eclipsed by the barrenness of the vineyard, he was greatly concerned: <span class="ital">a song of my beloved </span>— Not devised by me, but inspired by God, which, therefore, it behooveth you to lay deeply to heart: <span class="ital">touching his vineyard </span>— The house of Israel, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-7.htm" title="For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.">Isaiah 5:7</a>,) or his church among the Israelites, often, and very properly, called a vineyard, because of God’s singular regard to it, and care and cultivation of it; his delight in it, and expectation of good fruit from it. <span class="ital">My beloved hath, </span>&c. — Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">לידידי היה כרם</span>, <span class="ital">my beloved hath had a vineyard, </span>namely, for many ages, with which he hath long taken great pains, and on which he hath bestowed much culture; <span class="ital">in a very fruitful hill </span>— Hebrew, <span class="ital">on a horn, the son of oil, </span>“an expression,” says Bishop Lowth, “highly descriptive and poetical.” According to Kimchi the prophet gives the land of Israel this appellation because of its height and fertility. Accordingly, the bishop renders the phrase, <span class="ital">on a high and fruitful hill, </span>observing, that “the parts of animals are, by an easy metaphor, applied to parts of the earth, both in common and poetical language. A promontory is called <span class="ital">a cape, </span>or <span class="ital">head; </span>the Turks call it <span class="ital">a nose; </span>a ridge of rocks, <span class="ital">a back, </span>(<span class="ital">‘dorsum immane mari summo, </span>a huge <span class="ital">back </span>in the deep sea;’ Virg.) Thus <span class="ital">a horn </span>is a proper and obvious image for a mountain, or mountainous country.” Hills are places most commodious for vines, and the hills of Canaan being very fertile, the phrase, <span class="ital">Song of Solomon of oil, </span>is added to express that circumstance, both because oil includes the idea of fatness, and because <span class="ital">oil-olive </span>was one of the most valued productions of that land. Indeed the word <span class="ital">horn </span>also is frequently used in Scripture as an emblem of plenty, their wealth consisting very much in their <span class="ital">herds, </span>as well as flocks.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-7 Christ is God's beloved Son, and our beloved Saviour. The care of the Lord over the church of Israel, is described by the management of a vineyard. The advantages of our situation will be brought into the account another day. He planted it with the choicest vines; gave them a most excellent law, instituted proper ordinances. The temple was a tower, where God gave tokens of his presence. He set up his altar, to which the sacrifices should be brought; all the means of grace are denoted thereby. God expects fruit from those that enjoy privileges. Good purposes and good beginnings are good things, but not enough; there must be vineyard fruit; thoughts and affections, words and actions, agreeable to the Spirit. It brought forth bad fruit. Wild grapes are the fruits of the corrupt nature. Where grace does not work, corruption will. But the wickedness of those that profess religion, and enjoy the means of grace, must be upon the sinners themselves. They shall no longer be a peculiar people. When errors and vice go without check or control, the vineyard is unpruned; then it will soon be grown over with thorns. This is often shown in the departure of God's Spirit from those who have long striven against him, and the removal of his gospel from places which have long been a reproach to it. The explanation is given. It is sad with a soul, when, instead of the grapes of humility, meekness, love, patience, and contempt of the world, for which God looks, there are the wild grapes of pride, passion, discontent, and malice, and contempt of God; instead of the grapes of praying and praising, the wild grapes of cursing and swearing. Let us bring forth fruit with patience, that in the end we may obtain everlasting life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now will I sing - This is an indication that what follows is poetic, or is adapted to be sung or chanted.<p>To my well-beloved - The word used here - &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1491;  yed&#305;&#770;yd - is a term of endearment. It properly denotes a friend; a favorite; one greatly beloved. It is applied to saints as being the beloved, or the favorites of God, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/127-2.htm">Psalm 127:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Deuteronomy 33:12</a>. In this place, it is evidently applied to Yahweh, the God of the Jewish people. As there is some reason to believe that the God of the Jews - the manifested Deity who undertook their deliverance from Egypt, and who was revealed as "their" God under the name of 'the Angel of the covenant' - was the Messiah, so it may be that the prophet here meant to refer to him. It is not, however, to the Messiah "to come." It does not refer to the God incarnate - to Jesus of Nazareth; but to the God of the Jews, in his capacity as their lawgiver and protector in the time of Isaiah; not to him in the capacity of an incarnate Saviour.<p>A Song of my beloved - Lowth, 'A song of loves,' by a slight change in the Hebrew. The word &#1491;&#1493;&#1491;  do&#770;d usually denotes 'an uncle,' a father's brother. But it also means one beloved, a friend, a lover; Sol 1:13-14, Sol 1:16; Sol 2:3, Sol 2:8, Sol 2:9; Sol 4:16. Here it refers to Jehovah, and expresses the tender and affectionate attachment which the prophet had for his character and laws.<p>Touching his vineyard - The Jewish people are often represented under the image of a vineyard, planted and cultivated by God; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/80.htm">Psalm 80</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-10.htm">Jeremiah 12:10</a>. Our Saviour also used this beautiful figure to denote the care and attention which God had bestowed on his people; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33</a> ff; <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-1.htm">Mark 12:1</a>, following.<p>My beloved - God.<p>Hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill - Hebrew 'On a horn of the son of oil.' The word "horn" used here in the Hebrew, denotes the "brow, apex," or sharp point of a hill. The word is thus used in other languages to denote a hill, as in the Swiss words "shreckhorn, buchorn." Thus "Cornwall," in England, is called in the old British tongue "Kernaw," as lessening by degrees, like a horn, running out into promontories, like so many horns; for the Britons called a horn "corn," and in the plural "kern." The term 'horn' is not unfrequently applied to hills. Thus, Pococke tells us (vol. ii. p. 67), that there is a low mountain in Galilee which has both its ends raised in such a manner as to look like two mounts, which are called the 'Horns of Hutin.' Harmer, however, supposes that the term is used here to denote the land of Syria, from its resemblance to the shape ofa horn; Obs. iii. 242. But the idea is, evidently, that the land on which God respresents himself as having planted his vineyard, was like an elevated hill that was adapted eminently to such a culture. It may mean either the "top" of a mountain, or a little mountain, or a "peak" divided from others. The most favorable places for vineyards were on the sides of hills, where they would be exposed to the sun. - Shaw's "Travels," p. 338. Thus Virgil says:<p> - denique apertos<p>Bacchus amat colles.<p>Bacchus loves open hills;' "Georg." ii. 113. The phrase, "son of oil," is used in accordance with the Jewish custom, where "son" means descendant, relative, etc.; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>. Here it means that it was so fertile that it might be called the very "son of oil," or fatness, that is, fertility. The image is poetic, and very beautiful; denoting that God had planted his people in circumstances where he had a right to expect great growth in attachment to him. It was not owing to any want of care on his part, that they were not distinguished for piety. The Chaldee renders this verse, 'The prophet said, I will sing now to Israel, who is compared to a vineyard, the seed of Abraham my beloved: a song of my beloved to his vineyard.' <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 5<p>Isa 5:1-30. Parable of Jehovah's Vineyard.<p>A new prophecy; entire in itself. Probably delivered about the same time as the second and third chapters, in Uzziah's reign. Compare Isa 5:15, 16 with Isa 2:17; and Isa 5:1 with Isa 3:14. However, the close of the chapter alludes generally to the still distant invasion of Assyrians in a later reign (compare Isa 5:26 with Isa 7:18; and Isa 5:25 with Isa 9:12). When the time drew nigh, according to the ordinary prophetic usage, he handles the details more particularly (Isa 7:1-8:22); namely, the calamities caused by the Syro-Israelitish invasion, and subsequently by the Assyrians whom Ahaz had invited to his help.<p>1. to&#8212;rather, "concerning" [Gesenius], that is, in the person of My beloved, as His representative [Vitringa].

Suggestive of isolation, security, and a sunny aspect. Isaiah alludes plainly to the Song of Solomon (So 6:3; 8:11, 12), in the words "His vineyard" and "my Beloved" (compare Isa 26:20; 61:10, with So 1:4; 4:10). The transition from "branch" (Isa 4:2) to "vineyard" here is not unnatural.Israel God’s vineyard; his mercies, and their unfruitfulness; should be laid waste, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/5-1.htm" title="Now will I sing to my well beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard.

These are the words of the Prophet Isaiah, being about to represent the state and condition of the people of Israel by way of parable, which he calls a song, and which he determines to sing to his beloved, and calls upon himself to do it; by whom he means either God the Father, whom he loved with all his heart and soul; or Christ, who is often called the beloved of his people, especially in the book of Solomon's song; or else the people of Israel, whom the prophet had a great affection for, being his own people; but it seems best to understand it of God or Christ: <p>a song of my beloved; which was inspired by him, or related to him, and was made for his honour and glory; or "a song of my uncle" (q), for another word is used here than what is in the preceding clause, and is rendered "uncle" elsewhere, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-49.htm">Leviticus 25:49</a> and may design King Amaziah; for, according to tradition, Amoz, the father of Isaiah, was brother to Amaziah king of Judah, and so consequently Amaziah must be uncle to Isaiah; and this might be a song of his composing, or in which he was concerned, being king of Judah, the subject of this song, as follows: <p>touching his vineyard; not his uncle's, though it is true of him, but his well beloved's, God or Christ; the people of Israel, and house of Judah, are meant, comparable to a vineyard, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-7.htm">Isaiah 5:7</a> being separated and distinguished from the rest of the nations of the world, for the use, service, and glory of God. <p>My beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill; or, "in a horn, the son of oil" (r); which designs the land of Israel, which was higher than other lands; and was, as some observe, in the form of a horn, longer than it was broad, and a very fruitful country, a land of olive oil, a land flowing with milk and honey, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7</a>.

It is chosen here for the sake of the assonance with the word for “vineyard.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1–7. The Parable of the Vineyard and its Application<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>One of the finest exhibitions of rhetorical skill and power which the book contains. The prophet appears in the guise of a minstrel before an assemblage of his countrymen, and proceeds to recite the unfortunate experience of a “friend” of his with his vineyard. The simple story, told in light popular verse, disarms the suspicions of the crowd, and the singer, having secured their sympathy, demands a verdict on the course which a man might be expected to pursue with so refractory a vineyard as this (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-3.htm" title="And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard.">Isaiah 5:3</a></span>). The answer was so obvious that the people, like our Lord’s hearers on a similar occasion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-41.htm" title="They say to him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard to other farmers, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.">Matthew 21:41</a>), had practically assented to their own condemnation before they clearly perceived the drift of the discourse. But from this point onwards the parable becomes more and more transparent, till at last the prophet, with a sudden change of rhythm (see on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-6.htm" title="And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor dig; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain on it.">Isaiah 5:6</a></span>), throws off all disguise and drives home the lesson of the whole in the crashing lines of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-7.htm" title="For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.">Isaiah 5:7</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The idea of Israel as the Lord’s vineyard probably originated with Isaiah. (Cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-14.htm" title="The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for you have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.">Isaiah 3:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-2.htm" title="In that day sing you to her, A vineyard of red wine.">Isaiah 27:2</a> ff.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-21.htm" title="Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then are you turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine to me?">Jeremiah 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-10.htm" title="Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.">Jeremiah 12:10</a> f.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-8.htm" title="You have brought a vine out of Egypt: you have cast out the heathen, and planted it.">Psalm 80:8</a> ff.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-1.htm" title="For the kingdom of heaven is like to a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard.">Matthew 20:1</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-33.htm" title="Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and dig a wine press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to farmers, and went into a far country:">Matthew 21:33</a> ff. and parallels.)<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - ISRAEL REBUKED BY THE PARABLE OF A VINEYARD. This chapter stands in a certain sense alone, neither closely connected with what precedes nor with what follows, excepting that it breathes throughout a tone of denunciation. There is also a want of connection between its parts, the allegory of the first section being succeeded by a series of rebukes for sins, expressed in the plainest language, and the rebukes being followed by a threat of punishment, also expressed with plainness. The resemblance of the parable with which the chapter opens to one of those delivered by our Lord, and recorded in the three synoptic Gospels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-1.htm">Mark 12:1-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-9.htm">Luke 20:9-16</a>), has been frequently noticed. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now will I sing to my Well-beloved.</span> The prophet sings to Jehovah a song concerning his vineyard. The song consists of eight lines, beginning with "My Well-beloved," and ending with "wild grapes." It is in a lively, dancing measure, very unlike the general style of Isaiah's poetry. The name "Well-beloved" seems to be taken by the prophet from the Song of Songs, where it occurs above twenty times. It well expresses the feeling of a loving soul towards its Creator and Redeemer. <span class="cmt_word">A song of my Well-beloved.</span> Bishop Lowth translates "A song of loves," and Mr. Cheyne "A love-song;" but this requires an alteration of the text, and is unsatisfactory from the fact that the song which follows is <span class="accented">not</span> a "love-song." May we not understand the words to mean "a song concerning my Well-beloved in respect of his vineyard?" <span class="cmt_word">Touching his vineyard</span>. Israel is compared to a "vine" in the Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-16</a>), and the Church of God to a "garden" in Canticles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-12.htm">Song of Solomon 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/5-1.htm">Song of Solomon 5:1</a>); perhaps also to a "vineyard" in the same book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/8-12.htm">Song of Solomon 8:12</a>). Isaiah may have had this last passage in his mind. <span class="cmt_word">My Beloved hath a vineyard</span>; rather, <span class="accented">had a vineyard</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>, LXX.). <span class="cmt_word">In a very fruitful hill</span>. So the passage is generally understood, since <span class="accented">keren</span>, horn, is used for a height by the Arabs (as also by the Germans, e.g. Matterhorn, Wetterhorn, Aarhorn, etc.), and "son of oil" is a not unlikely Orientalism for "rich" or "fruitful." With the "hill" of this passage compare the "mountain" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>, both passages indicating that the Church of God is set on aft eminence, and "cannot be hid" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When war shall thus unsparingly have swept away the men of Zion, a most unnatural effect will ensue, namely, that women will go in search of husbands, and not men in search of wives. "And seven women lay hold of one man in that day, saying, We will eat our won bread, and wear our own clothes; only let thy name be named upon us, take away our reproach." The division of the chapters is a wrong one here, as this v. is the closing v. of the prophecy against the women, and the closing portion of the whole address does not begin till <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a>. The present pride of the daughters of Zion, every one of whom now thought herself the greatest as the wife of such and such a man, and for whom many men were now the suitors, would end in this unnatural self-humiliation, that seven of them would offer themselves to the same man, the first man who presented himself, and even renounce the ordinary legal claim upon their husband for clothing and food (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-10.htm">Exodus 21:10</a>). It would be quite sufficient for them to be allowed to bear his name ("let thy name be named upon us:" the name is put upon the thing named, as giving it its distinctness and character), if he would only take away their reproach (namely, the reproach of being unmarried, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-4.htm">Isaiah 54:4</a>, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-23.htm">Genesis 30:23</a>, of being childless) by letting them be called his wives. The number seven (seven women to one man) may be explained on the ground that there is a bad seven as well as a holy one (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-45.htm">Matthew 12:45</a>). <p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-1.htm">Isaiah 4:1</a> the threat denounced against the women of Jerusalem is brought to a close. It is the side-piece to the threat denounced against the national rulers. And these two scenes of judgment were only parts of the general judgment about to fall upon Jerusalem and Judah, as a state or national community. And this again was merely a portion, viz., the central group of the picture of a far more comprehensive judgment, which was about to fall upon everything lofty and exalted on the earth. Jerusalem, therefore, stands here as the centre and focus of the great judgment-day. It was in Jerusalem that the ungodly glory which was ripe for judgment was concentrated; and it was in Jerusalem also that the light of the true and final glory would concentrate itself. To this promise, with which the address returns to its starting-point, the prophet now passes on without any further introduction. In fact it needed no introduction, for the judgment in itself was the medium of salvation. When Jerusalem was judged, it would be sifted; and by being sifted, it would be rescued, pardoned, glorified. The prophet proceeds in this sense to speak of what would happen in that day, and describes the one great day of God at the end of time (not a day of four-and-twenty hours any more than the seven days of creation were), according to its general character, as opening with judgment, but issuing in salvation. </body></html>
