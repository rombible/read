Or his words may be rendered, <span class="ital">the people go into, </span>&c.; that is, shall certainly and shortly go, speaking of the approaching judgments as if they were already come. <span class="ital">Because they have no knowledge</span> — No serious consideration of God’s works, and of their own duty and danger. <span class="ital">And their honourable men are famished </span>— Who thought themselves quite out of the reach of famine. <span class="ital">Therefore hell hath enlarged herself — The grave, </span>or the place of torment to which certainly the souls of such persons must descend; <span class="ital">and opened her mouth without measure —</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To receive those vast numbers which die by this famine, or otherwise, as is here implied. The prophet is thought to allude “to the form of the ancient sepulchres, which were subterraneous caverns hollowed out of a rock, the mouth of which was generally closed by a great stone. The <span class="ital">prosopopœia </span>is extremely fine and expressive, and the image is fraught with the most tremendous horror.” <span class="ital">And their glory, </span>&c. — Their nobles, or honourable men, as they are called, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-13.htm" title="Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.">Isaiah 5:13</a>, being distinguished, both here and there, from the multitude; <span class="ital">and their pomp </span>— Which shall die with them; <span class="ital">and he that rejoiceth </span>— That spendeth all his days in mirth and jollity, and casteth away all cares and fears; <span class="ital">shall descend into it </span>— Not only into the grave, but into hell. Bishop Lowth’s translation of this verse is peculiarly striking: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">“Therefore Hades hath enlarged his appetite; And hath stretched open his mouth without measure: And down go her nobility, and her populace, And her busy throng, and all that exult in her.”</span></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“These verses,” (13 and 14,) he justly observes, “have a reference to the two preceding. They that indulged in feasting and drinking, shall perish with hunger and thirst: and Hades” (the invisible world, hell prepared to receive these sinners that live and die in sin) “shall indulge his appetite as much as they had done, and devour them all. The image is strong and expressive in the highest degree. Habakkuk uses the same image with great force, chap. 2:5. But in Isaiah, Hades is introduced, to much greater advantage, in person; and placed before our eyes as a ravenous monster, opening wide his unmeasurable jaws, and swallowing them all together.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:8-23 Here is a woe to those who set their hearts on the wealth of the world. Not that it is sinful for those who have a house and a field to purchase another; but the fault is, that they never know when they have enough. Covetousness is idolatry; and while many envy the prosperous, wretched man, the Lord denounces awful woes upon him. How applicable to many among us! God has many ways to empty the most populous cities. Those who set their hearts upon the world, will justly be disappointed. Here is woe to those who dote upon the pleasures and the delights of sense. The use of music is lawful; but when it draws away the heart from God, then it becomes a sin to us. God's judgments have seized them, but they will not disturb themselves in their pleasures. The judgments are declared. Let a man be ever so high, death will bring him low; ever so mean, death will bring him lower. The fruit of these judgments shall be, that God will be glorified as a God of power. Also, as a God that is holy; he shall be owned and declared to be so, in the righteous punishment of proud men. Those are in a woful condition who set up sin, and who exert themselves to gratify their base lusts. They are daring in sin, and walk after their own lusts; it is in scorn that they call God the Holy One of Israel. They confound and overthrow distinctions between good and evil. They prefer their own reasonings to Divine revelations; their own devices to the counsels and commands of God. They deem it prudent and politic to continue profitable sins, and to neglect self-denying duties. Also, how light soever men make of drunkenness, it is a sin which lays open to the wrath and curse of God. Their judges perverted justice. Every sin needs some other to conceal it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore my people are gone - This is evidently used with reference to the "future."

The ancient versions, with a different vocalisation, read “dead with hunger,” which is obviously too strong. Most commentators now follow Ewald and Hitzig, and alter the text in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-24.htm" title="They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts on them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.">Deuteronomy 32:24</a> (R.V. “wasted”), reading “sucked out (exhausted) with hunger.” This involves the change of a single letter, and yields a suitable parallelism to “dried up with thirst.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore my people are gone into captivity</span>. "Are gone" or "have gone" is "the perfect of prophetic certainty" (Cheyne). The prophet sees the captivity as a thing that had already taken place.

The meaning is not that the Lord of the vineyard would not let any more rain fall upon it, because this Lord was Jehovah (which is not affirmed in fact in the words commencing with "for," Ci), but a more general one. This was how the case stood with the vineyard; for all Israel, and especially the people of Judah, were this vineyard, which had so bitterly deceived the expectations of its Lord, and indeed "the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts," and therefore of the omnipotent God, whom even the clouds would serve when He came forth to punish. The expression "for" (Ci) is not only intended to vindicate the truth of the last statement, but the truth of the whole simile, including this: it is an explanatory "for" (Ci explic.), which opens the epimythion. "The vineyard of the Lord of hosts" (Cerem Jehovah Zebaoth) is the predicate. "The house of Israel (Beth Yisra&#770;el) was the whole nation, which is also represented in other passages under the same figure of a vineyard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-2.htm">Isaiah 27:2</a>.; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/80.htm">Psalm 80</a>, etc.). But as Isaiah was prophet in Judah, he applies the figure more particularly to Judah, which was called Jehovah's favourite plantation, inasmuch as it was the seat of the divine sanctuary and of the Davidic kingdom. This makes it easy enough to interpret the different parts of the simile employed. The fat mountain-horn was Canaan, flowing with milk and honey (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-17.htm">Exodus 15:17</a>); the digging of the vineyard, and clearing it of stones, was the clearing of Canaan from its former heathen inhabitants (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-3.htm">Psalm 54:3</a>); the sorek-vines were the holy priests and prophets and kings of Israel of the earlier and better times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>); the defensive and ornamental tower in the midst of the vineyard was Jerusalem as the royal city, with Zion the royal fortress (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-8.htm">Micah 4:8</a>); the winepress-trough was the temple, where, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-9.htm">Psalm 36:9</a> (8.), the wine of heavenly pleasures flowed in streams, and from which, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/42-1.htm">Psalm 42:1-11</a> and many other passages, the thirst of the soul might all be quenched. The grazing and treading down are explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-10.htm">Jeremiah 5:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-10.htm">Jeremiah 12:10</a>. The bitter deception experienced by Jehovah is expressed in a play upon two words, indicating the surprising change of the desired result into the very opposite. The explanation which Gesenius, Caspari, Knobel, and others give of mispa&#770;ch, viz., bloodshed, does not commend itself; for even if it must be admitted that sa&#770;phach occurs once or twice in the "Arabizing" book of Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-7.htm">Job 30:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-19.htm">Job 14:19</a>) in the sense of pouring out, this verbal root is strange to the Hebrew (and the Aramaean). Moreover, mispa&#770;ch in any case would only mean pouring or shedding, and not bloodshed; and although the latter would certainly be possible by the side of the Arabic saffa&#770;ch, saffa&#770;k (shedder of blood), yet it would be such an ellipsis as cannot be shown anywhere else in Hebrew usage. On the other hand, the rendering "leprosy" does not yield any appropriate sense, as mispachath (sappachath) is never generalized anywhere else into the single idea of "dirt" (Luzzatto: sozzura), nor does it appear as an ethical notion. We therefore prefer to connect it with a meaning unquestionably belonging to the verb &#1505;&#1508;&#1495; (see kal, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-36.htm">1 Samuel 2:36</a>; niphal, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-1.htm">Isaiah 14:1</a>; hithpael, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-19.htm">1 Samuel 26:19</a>), which is derived in &#1497;&#1505;&#1507;, &#1488;&#1505;&#1507;, &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;, from the primary notion "to sweep," spec. to sweep towards, sweep in, or sweep away. Hence we regard mispach as denoting the forcible appropriation of another man's property; certainly a suitable antithesis to mishpa&#770;t. The prophet describes, in full-toned figures, how the expected noble grapes had turned into wild grapes, with nothing more than an outward resemblance. The introduction to the prophecy closes here. <p>The prophecy itself follows next, a seven-fold discourse composed of the six-fold woe contained in vv. 8-23, and the announcement of punishment in which it terminates. In this six-fold woe the prophet describes the bad fruits one by one. In confirmation of our rendering of mispa&#770;ch, the first woe relates to covetousness and avarice as the root of all evil. </body></html>
