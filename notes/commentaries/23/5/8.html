The form of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/6-24.htm" title="But woe to you that are rich! for you have received your consolation.">Luke 6:24-26</a> seems based upon it. The general indictment of Isaiah 1 is followed by special counts. That which leads off the list was the destruction of the old village life of Palestine. The original ideal of the nation had been that it should consist of small proprietors; and the Jubilee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-13.htm" title="In the year of this jubilee you shall return every man to his possession.">Leviticus 25:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-24.htm" title="In the year of the jubilee the field shall return to him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.">Leviticus 27:24</a>), and the law of the marriage of heiresses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/27-1.htm" title="Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.">Numbers 27:1-11</a>, Numbers 36, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-54.htm" title="And you shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the more you shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falls; according to the tribes of your fathers you shall inherit.">Numbers 33:54</a>) were intended as safeguards for the maintenance of that ideal. In practice it had broken down, and might had taken the place of right. Landmarks were removed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-14.htm" title="You shall not remove your neighbor's landmark, which they of old time have set in your inheritance, which you shall inherit in the land that the LORD your God gives you to possess it.">Deuteronomy 19:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-17.htm" title="Cursed be he that removes his neighbor's landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen.">Deuteronomy 27:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-28.htm" title="Remove not the ancient landmark, which your fathers have set.">Proverbs 22:28</a>), the owners of small estates forcibly expelled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-2.htm" title="And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.">Micah 2:2</a>) or murdered as Naboth had been (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-16.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.">1Kings 21:16</a>); the law of debt pressed against the impoverished debtor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-5.htm" title="Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children: and, see, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought to bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.">Nehemiah 5:5</a>), and the law of the Jubilee was practically set aside. In place of the small freeholders there rose up a class of large proprietors, often the <span class= "ital">novi homines </span>of the state (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Shebna in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-16.htm" title="What have you here? and whom have you here, that you have hewed you out a sepulcher here, as he that hews him out a sepulcher on high, and that engraves an habitation for himself in a rock?">Isaiah 22:16</a>), while the original owners sank into slavery (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-5.htm" title="Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children: and, see, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought to bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.">Nehemiah 5:5</a>) or became tenants at will, paying exorbitant rents in kind or money, and liable at any moment to be evicted. Isaiah’s complaint recalls the agrarian laws by which first Licinius and then the Gracchi sought to restrain the extension of the <span class= "ital">latifundia </span>of the Roman patricians, and Latimer’s bold protest against the enclosure of commons in the sixteenth century. The evil had been denounced before by Micah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-2.htm" title="And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.">Micah 2:2</a>), and in a psalm probably contemporary with Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-11.htm" title="Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.">Psalm 49:11</a>). The fact that the last year of Uzziah coincided with the Jubilee may have given a special point to Isaiah’s protest.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/isaiah/5.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Isaiah<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A PROPHET’S WOES<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-8.htm" title="Woe to them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the middle of the earth!">Isaiah 5:8</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-30.htm" title="And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if one look to the land, behold darkness and sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.">Isaiah 5:30</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Drunkenness is, in this text, one of a ring of plague-spots on the body politic of Judah. The prophet six times proclaims ‘woe’ as the inevitable end of these; such ‘sickness’ is ‘unto death’ unless repentance and another course of conduct bring healing. But drunkenness appears twice in this grim catalogue, and the longest paragraph of denunciation {<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-11.htm" title="Woe to them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!">Isaiah 5:11</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-17.htm" title="Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.">Isaiah 5:17</a>} is devoted to it. Its connection with the other vices attacked is loose, but it is worth noting that all these have an inner kinship, and tend to appear together. They are ‘all in a string,’ and where a community is cursed with one, the others will not be far away. They are a knot of serpents intertwined. We touch but slightly on the other vices denounced by the prophet’s burning words, but we must premise the general observation that the same uncompromising plainness and boldness in speaking out as to social sins ought to characterise Christian teachers to-day. The prophet’s office is not extinct in the church.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The first plague-spot is the accumulation of wealth in few hands, and the selfish withdrawal of its possessors from the life of the community. In an agricultural society like that of Judah, that clotting of wealth took the shape of ‘land-grabbing,’ and of evicting the small proprietors. We see it in more virulent forms in our great commercial centres, where the big men often become big by crushing out the little ones, and denude themselves of responsibility to the community in proportion as they clothe themselves with wealth. Wherever wealth is thus congested, and its obligations ignored by selfish indulgence, the seeds are sown which will spring up one day in ‘anarchism.’ A man need not be a prophet to have it whispered in his ear, as Isaiah had, that the end of selfish capitalism is a convulsion in which ‘many houses shall be desolate,’ and many fields barren. England needs the warning as much as Isaiah’s Judah did.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Such selfish wealth leads, among other curses, to indolence and drunkenness, as the next woe shows. The people described make drinking the business of their lives, beginning early and sitting late. They have a varnish of art over their swinishness, and must have music as well as wine. So, in many a drink-shop in England, a piano or a band adds to the attractions, and gives a false air of aestheticism to pure animalism. Isaiah feels the incongruity that music should be so prostituted, and expresses it by adding to his list of musical instruments ‘and wine’ as if he would underscore the degradation of the great art to be the cupbearer of sots. Such revellers are blind to the manifest tokens of God’s working, and the ‘operation of His hands’ excites only the tipsy gaze which sees nothing. That is one of the curses which dog the drunkard-that he takes no warning from the plain results of his vice as seen in others. He knows that it means shattered health, ruined prospects, broken hearts, but nothing rouses him from his fancy of impunity. High, serious thoughts of God and His government of the world and of each life are strange to him. His sin compels him to be godless, if he is not to go mad. But sometimes he wakes to a moment’s sight of realities, and then he is miserable till his next bout buys fatal forgetfulness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The prophet forces the end of a drunken nation on the unwilling attention of the roisterers, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-13.htm" title="Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.">Isaiah 5:13</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-17.htm" title="Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.">Isaiah 5:17</a>, which throb with vehemence of warning and gloomy eloquence. What can such a people come to but destruction? Knowledge must languish, hunger and thirst must follow. Like some monster’s gaping mouth, the pit yawns for them; and, drawn as by irresistible attraction, the pomp and the wicked, senseless jollity elide down into it. In the universal catastrophe, one thing alone stands upright, and is lifted higher, because all else has sunk so far,-the righteous judgment of the forgotten God. The grim picture is as true for individuals and their deaths as for a nation and its decay. And modern nations cannot afford to have this ulcer of drunkenness draining away their strength any more than Judah could. ‘By the soul only are the nations great and free,’ and a people can be neither where the drink fiend has his way.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Three woes follow which are closely connected. That pronounced on daring evil-doers, who not only let sin draw them to itself, but go more than halfway to meet it, needing no temptation, but drawing it to them eagerly, and scoffing at the merciful warnings of fatal consequences, comes first. Next is a woe on those who play fast and loose with plain morality, sophisticating conscience, and sapping the foundations of law. Such juggling follows sensual indulgence such as drunkenness, when it becomes habitual and audacious, as in the preceding woe. Loose or perverted codes of morality generally spring from bad living, seeking to shelter itself. Vicious principles are an afterthought to screen vicious practices. The last subject of the triple woes is self-conceit and pretence to superior illumination. Such very superior persons are emancipated from the rules which bind the common herd. They are so very clever that they have far outgrown the creeping moralities, which may do for old women and children. Do we not know the sort of people? Have we none of them surviving to-day?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Then Isaiah comes back to his theme of drunkenness, but in a new connection. It poisons the fountain of justice. There is a world of indignant contempt in the prophet’s scathing picture of those who are ‘mighty’ and ‘men of strength,’-but how is their strength shown? They can stand any quantity of wine, and can ‘mix their drinks,’ and yet look sober! What a noble use to put a good constitution to! These valiant topers are in authority as judges, and they sell their judgments to get money for their debauches. We do not see much of such scandals among us, but yet we have heard of leagues between liquor-sellers and municipal authorities, which certainly do <span class="ital">not</span> ‘make for righteousness.’ When shall we learn and practise the lesson that Isaiah was reading his countrymen,-that it is fatal to a nation when the private character of public men is regarded as of no account in political and civic life? The prophet had no doubt as to what must be the end of a state of things in which the very courts of law were honeycombed with corruption, and demoralised by the power of drink. His tremendous image of a fierce fire raging across a dry prairie, and burning the grass to its very roots, while the air is stifling with the thick ‘dust’ of the conflagration, proclaims the sure fate, sooner or later, of every community and individual that ‘rejects the law of the Lord of Hosts, and despises the word of the Holy One of Israel.’ Change the name, and the tale is told of us; for it is ‘righteousness that exalteth a nation,’ and no single vice drags after it more infallibly such a multitude of attendant demons as the vice of drunkenness, which is a crying sin of England to-day.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/5-8.htm" title="Woe to them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the middle of the earth!...">Isaiah 5:8-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">Wo unto them, </span>&c. — The unfolding of the parable, after the general key in the preceding verse, comprehends two things, according to the argument of the parable; the crimes of this ungrateful people, and the punishment decreed to their crimes. <span class="ital">That join house to house </span>— That add new purchases of houses and lands to their former possessions. Not that this was in itself absolutely unlawful, but because they did it from an inordinate desire of riches, and with the injury of their brethren. <span class="ital">That they may be placed alone </span>— That they alone may be the lords and owners, and all others only their tenants and servants. Thus, “the first crime condemned is avarice and rapacity; which is strongly described in this verse, and which prevailed remarkably among the Jews. Its punishment, even the desolation of those houses which they coveted, and the devastation of those fields which they obtained so rapaciously, is set forth in the two following verses.” See Vitringa. <span class="ital">In mine ears, said the Lord </span>— That is, <span class="ital">It was revealed in mine ears: </span>or, I heard God speak what I am now about to utter. <span class="ital">Of a truth many houses shall be desolate </span>— “In vain are ye so intent upon joining house to house, and field to field; your houses shall be left uninhabited, and your fields shall become desolate and barren: so that a vineyard of ten acres shall produce but one bath (not eight gallons) of wine, and the husbandman shall reap but a tenth part of the seed which he has sown.” — Bishop Lowth. Thus it is predicted that a fruitful land should be made barren for their wickedness, according to God’s threatening, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-34.htm" title="A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.">Psalm 107:34</a>,) and they would have as little comfort in their lands as in their houses.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:8-23 Here is a woe to those who set their hearts on the wealth of the world. Not that it is sinful for those who have a house and a field to purchase another; but the fault is, that they never know when they have enough. Covetousness is idolatry; and while many envy the prosperous, wretched man, the Lord denounces awful woes upon him. How applicable to many among us! God has many ways to empty the most populous cities. Those who set their hearts upon the world, will justly be disappointed. Here is woe to those who dote upon the pleasures and the delights of sense. The use of music is lawful; but when it draws away the heart from God, then it becomes a sin to us. God's judgments have seized them, but they will not disturb themselves in their pleasures. The judgments are declared. Let a man be ever so high, death will bring him low; ever so mean, death will bring him lower. The fruit of these judgments shall be, that God will be glorified as a God of power. Also, as a God that is holy; he shall be owned and declared to be so, in the righteous punishment of proud men. Those are in a woful condition who set up sin, and who exert themselves to gratify their base lusts. They are daring in sin, and walk after their own lusts; it is in scorn that they call God the Holy One of Israel. They confound and overthrow distinctions between good and evil. They prefer their own reasonings to Divine revelations; their own devices to the counsels and commands of God. They deem it prudent and politic to continue profitable sins, and to neglect self-denying duties. Also, how light soever men make of drunkenness, it is a sin which lays open to the wrath and curse of God. Their judges perverted justice. Every sin needs some other to conceal it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wo unto them ... - The prophet now proceeds to "specify" some of the crimes to which he had referred in the parable of the vineyard, of which the Jews had been guilty. The first is "avarice."<p>That join house to house - That seek to possess many houses; or perhaps that seek to live in large and magnificent palaces. A similar denunciation of this sin is recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-1.htm">Nehemiah 5:1-8</a>. This, together with what follows, was contrary to the law of Moses. He provided that when the children of Israel should enter the land of Canaan, the land should be equitably divided; and in order to prevent avarice, he ordained the "jubilee," occurring once in fifty years, by which every man and every family should be restored to their former possession; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25.htm">Leviticus 25</a>. Perhaps there could have been no law so well framed to prevent the existence, and avoid the evils of covetousness. Yet, in defiance of the obvious requirements and spirit of that law, the people in the time of Isaiah had beome generally covetous.<p>That lay field to field - That purchase one farm after another. The words 'that lay,' mean "to cause to approach;" that is, they "join" on one farm after another.<p>Till there be no place - Until they reach the "outer limit" of the land; until they possess all.<p>That they may be placed alone - That they may displace all others; that they may drive off from their lands all others, and take possession of them themselves.<p>In the midst of the earth - Or rather, in the midst of the "land." They seek to obtain the whole of it, and to expel all the present owners. Never was there a more correct description of avarice. It is satisfied with no present possessions, and would be satisfied only if all the earth were in its possession. Nor would the covetous man be satisfied then. He would sit down and weep that there was nothing more which he could desire. How different this from that "contentment" which is produced by religion, and the love of the happiness of others! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Isa 5:8-23.

The first woe, against the absorption of small properties by the wealthy landowners. Cruel evictions, by which the smaller peasant proprietors lost not only their homes but the rights of citizenship, were common in the age of Isaiah, both in Judah and Israel. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-2.htm" title="And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.">Micah 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-9.htm" title="The women of my people have you cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have you taken away my glory for ever.">Micah 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-6.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;">Amos 2:6</a> f. “The old Israelite state was so entirely based on the participation of every freeman in the common soil, and so little recognised the mere possession of capital, that men were in danger of losing civil rights along with house and fields, and becoming mere hirelings or even slaves” (Duhm).

The prophet sets before us a vivid picture of a debased aristocracy, in whom public virtue has been eaten out by avarice and sensuality; and he traces with remarkable insight the effect of these sins in the religious insensibility and perversion of the moral sentiments which characterised the nobles of Judah at this time.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-24.</span> - THE SIX WOES. After the general warning conveyed to Israel by the parable of the vineyard, six sins are particularized as those which have especially provoked God to give the warning. On each of these woe is denounced. Two have special punishments assigned to them (vers. 8-17); the remainder are joined in one general threat of retribution (vers. 18  - 24). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto them that join house to house</span>. This is <span class="accented">the first woe</span>. It is pronounced on the greed which leads men to continually enlarge their estates, without regard to their neighbors' convenience. Nothing is said of any use of unfair means, much <span class="accented">less</span> of violence in dispossessing the former proprietors. What is denounced is the selfishness of vast accumulations of land in single bands, to the detriment of the rest of the community. The Jewish law was peculiarly inimical to this practice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-54.htm">Numbers 33:54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-4.htm">1 Kings 21:4</a>); but perhaps it is not without reason that many writers of our own time object to it on general grounds. <span class="cmt_word">Till there be no place</span>; literally, <span class="accented">till want of place</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> till there is no room for others. A hyperbole, doubtless, but marking a real national inconvenience. That they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth; rather, <span class="accented">that ye may dwell by yourselves in the midst of the land</span>. The great landlords wished to isolate themselves; they disliked neighbors; they would fain "dwell by themselves," without neighbors to trouble them. Uzziah seems, by what is said of his possessions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-10.htm">2 Chronicles 26:10</a>), to have been one of the greatest sinners in respect of the accumulation of land. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet commenced his first address in chapter 1 like another Moses; the second, which covered no less ground, he opened with the text of an earlier prophecy; and now he commences the third like a musician, addressing both himself and his hearers with enticing words. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>. "Arise, I will sing of my beloved, a song of my dearest touching his vineyard." The fugitive rhythm, the musical euphony, the charming assonances in this appeal, it is impossible to reproduce. They are perfectly inimitable. The Lamed in l&#305;&#772;d&#305;&#772;d&#305;&#772; is the Lamed objecti. The person to whom the song referred, to whom it applied, of whom it treated, was the singer's own beloved. It was a song of his dearest one (not his cousin, patruelis, as Luther renders it in imitation of the Vulgate, for the meaning of do&#772;d is determined by ya&#770;did, beloved) touching his vineyard. The Lamed in l'carmo is also Lamed objecti. The song of the beloved is really a song concerning the vineyard of the beloved; and this song is a song of the beloved himself, not a song written about him, or attributed to him, but such a song as he himself had sung, and still had to sing. The prophet, by beginning in this manner, was surrounded (either in spirit or in outward reality) by a crowd of people from Jerusalem and Judah. The song is a short one, and runs thus in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a> : "My beloved had a vineyard on a fatly nourished mountain-horn, and dug it up and cleared it of stones, and planted it with noble vines, and built a tower in it, and also hewed out a wine-press therein; and hoped that it would bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes." The vineyard was situated upon a keren, i.e., upon a prominent mountain peak projecting like a horn, and therefore open to the sun on all sides; for, as Virgil says in the Georgics, "apertos Bacchus amat colles." This mountain horn was ben-shemen, a child of fatness: the fatness was innate, it belonged to it by nature (shemen is used, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1</a>, to denote the fertility of a nutritive loamy soil). And the owner of the vineyard spared no attention or trouble. The plough could not be used, from the steepness of the mountain slope: he therefore dug it up, that is to say, he turned up the soil which was to be made into a vineyard with a hoe (izze&#772;k, to hoe; Arab. mi&#8219;zak, mi&#8219;zaka); and as he found it choked up with stones and boulders, he got rid of this rubbish by throwing it out sikke&#772;l, a privative piel, lapidibus purgare, then operam consumere in lapides, sc. ejiciendos, to stone, or clear of stones: Ges. 52, 2). After the soil had been prepared he planted it with sorek, i.e., the finest kind of eastern vine, bearing small grapes of a bluish-red, with pips hardly perceptible to the tongue. The name is derived from its colour (compare the Arabic zerka, red wine). To protect and adorn the vineyard which had been so richly planted, he built a tower in the midst of it. The expression "and also" calls especial attention to the fact that he hewed out a wine-trough therein (yekeb, the trough into which the must or juice pressed from the grapes in the wine-press flows, lacus as distinguished from torcular); that is to say, in order that the trough might be all the more fixed and durable, he constructed it in a rocky portion of the ground (Cha&#770;tse&#772;b bo instead of Cha&#774;tsab bo, with a and the accent drawn back, because a Beth was thereby easily rendered inaudible, so that Cha&#770;tse&#772;b is not a participial adjective, as Bttcher supposes). This was a difficult task, as the expression "and also" indicates; and for that very reason it was an evidence of the most confident expectation. But how bitterly was this deceived! The vineyard produced no such fruit, as might have been expected from a sorek plantation; it brought forth no &#8219;ana&#770;bim whatever, i.e., no such grapes as a cultivated vine should bear, but only b'ushim, or wild grapes. Luther first of all adopted the rendering wild grapes, and then altered it to harsh or sour grapes. But it comes to the same thing. The difference between a wild vine and a good vine is only qualitative. The vitis vinifera, like all cultivated plants, is assigned to the care of man, under which it improves; whereas in its wild state it remains behind its true intention (see Genesis, 622). Consequently the word b'ushim (from ba&#770;'ash, to be bad, or smell bad) denotes not only the grapes of the wild vine, which are naturally small and harsh (Rashi, lambruches, i.e., grapes of the labrusca, which is used now, however, as the botanical name of a vine that is American in its origin), but also grapes of a good stock, which have either been spoiled or have failed to ripen.<p>(Note: In the Jerusalem Talmud such grapes are called u&#772;bshin, the letters being transposed; and in the Mishnah (Ma'aseroth i. 2, Zeb'ith iv 8) &#1492;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is the standing word applied to grapes that are only half ripe (see Lwy's Leshon Chachamim, or Wrterbuch des talmudischen Hebrisch, Prag 1845). With reference to the wild grape (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;), a writer, describing the useful plants of Greece, says, "Its fruit (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;) consists of very small berries, not much larger than bilberries, with a harsh flavour.")<p>These were the grapes which the vineyard produced, such as you might indeed have expected from a wild vine, but not from carefully cultivated vines of the very choicest kind. </body></html>
