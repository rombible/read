Not that it is sinful for those who have a house and a field to purchase another; but the fault is, that they never know when they have enough. Covetousness is idolatry; and while many envy the prosperous, wretched man, the Lord denounces awful woes upon him. How applicable to many among us! God has many ways to empty the most populous cities. Those who set their hearts upon the world, will justly be disappointed. Here is woe to those who dote upon the pleasures and the delights of sense. The use of music is lawful; but when it draws away the heart from God, then it becomes a sin to us. God's judgments have seized them, but they will not disturb themselves in their pleasures. The judgments are declared. Let a man be ever so high, death will bring him low; ever so mean, death will bring him lower. The fruit of these judgments shall be, that God will be glorified as a God of power. Also, as a God that is holy; he shall be owned and declared to be so, in the righteous punishment of proud men. Those are in a woful condition who set up sin, and who exert themselves to gratify their base lusts. They are daring in sin, and walk after their own lusts; it is in scorn that they call God the Holy One of Israel. They confound and overthrow distinctions between good and evil. They prefer their own reasonings to Divine revelations; their own devices to the counsels and commands of God. They deem it prudent and politic to continue profitable sins, and to neglect self-denying duties. Also, how light soever men make of drunkenness, it is a sin which lays open to the wrath and curse of God. Their judges perverted justice. Every sin needs some other to conceal it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The prophet proceeds to state still further the extent of their crimes. This verse contains an account of their dissipated habits, and their consequent forgetfulness of God. That they commonly had musical instruments in their feasts, is evident from many passages of the Old Testament; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5-6</a>. Their feasts, also, were attended with songs; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-8.htm">Isaiah 24:8-9</a>.<p>The harp -  - &#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;  kinno&#770;r. This is a well-known stringed instrument, employed commonly in sacred music. It is often mentioned as having been used to express the pious feelings of David; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-2.htm">Psalm 32:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-4.htm">Psalm 43:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-5.htm">Psalm 49:5</a>. It is early mentioned as having been invented by Jubal; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-21.htm">Genesis 4:21</a>. It is supposed usually to have had ten strings (Josephus, "Ant." B. x. ch. xii. Section 3). It was played by the hand; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-23.htm">1 Samuel 16:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-9.htm">1 Samuel 18:9</a>. The "root" of the word &#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;  kinno&#770;r, is unknown. The word "kinnor" is used in all the languages cognate to the Hebrew, and is recognized even in the Persian. It is probable that the instrument here referred to was common in all the oriental nations, as it seems to have been known before the Flood, and of course the knowledge of it would be extended far. It is an oriental name and instrument, and from this word the Greeks derived their word &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;  kinura. The Septuagint renders it &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;  kithara and &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;  kinura.<p>Once they substitute for it &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; organon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-2.htm">Psalm 136:2</a>; and five times &#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  psalte&#772;rion, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-20.htm">Genesis 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-4.htm">Psalm 48:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-2.htm">Psalm 80:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/149-3.htm">Psalm 149:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-13.htm">Ezekiel 26:13</a>. The harp - &#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;  kinno&#770;r - is not only mentioned as having been invented by Jubal, but it is also mentioned by Laban in the description which be gives of various solemnities, in regard to which he assures the fleeing Jacob that it had been his wish to accompany him with all the testimonials of joy - 'with music - &#1514;&#1507;  to&#770;ph and &#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;  kinno&#770;r;' <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-27.htm">Genesis 31:27</a>. In the first age it was consecrated to joy and exultation. Hence, it is referred to as the instrument employed by David to drive away the melancholy of Saul <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-16.htm">1 Samuel 16:16-22</a>, and is the instrument usually employed to celebrate the praises of God; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/33-1.htm">Psalm 33:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-4.htm">Psalm 43:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-5.htm">Psalm 49:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/71-22.htm">Psalm 71:22-23</a>. But the harp was not only used on sacred occasions. Isaiah also mentions it as carried about by courtezans <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-16.htm">Isaiah 23:16</a>, and also refers to it as used on occasions of gathering in the vintage, and of increasing the joy of the festival occasion.<p>So also it was used in military triumphs. Under the reign of Jehoshaphat, after a victory which had been gained over the Moabites, they returned in triumph to Jerusalem, accompanied with playing on the &#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;  kinno&#770;r;" <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-27.htm">2 Chronicles 20:27-28</a>. The harp was generally used on occasions of joy. Only in one place, in Isaiah Isa 16:11, is it referred to as having been employed in times of mourning. There is no ancient figure of the &#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;  kinno&#770;r that can be relied on as genuine. We can only say that it was an instrument made of sounding wood, and furnished with strings. Josephus says that it was furnished with ten strings, and was played with the plectrum ("Ant." B. viii. ch. x.) Suidas, in his explanation of it, makes express mention of strings or sinews (p. 318); and Pollux speaks of goats' claws as being used for the plectrum. David made it out of the &#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;  bero&#770;sh, or fir, and Solomon out of the almug. Pfeiffer supposes, that the strings were drawn over the belly of a hollow piece of wood, and that it had some resemblance to our violin. But it is more probable that the common representation of the harp as nearly in the form of a triangle, with one side or the front part missing, is the correct one. For a full discussion of the subject, see Pfeiffer on the Music of the ancient Hebrews, "Bib. Repos." vol. vi. pp. 366-373. Montfaucon has furnished a drawing of what was supposed to be the ancient &#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;  kinno&#770;r, which is represented in the book. But, after all, the usual form is not quite certain.<p>Bruce found a sculpture of a harp resembling that usually put into the hands of David, or nearly in the form of a triangle, and under circumstances which led him to suppose that it was as old as the times of Sesostris.<p>And the viol - &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;  nebel. From this word is derived the Greek word &#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;  nabla, and the Latin nablium and nabla. But it is not very easy to form a correct idea of this instrument. The derivation would lead us to suppose that it was something in the shape of a "bottle," and it is probable that it had a form in the shape of a leather bottle, such as is used in the East, or at least a vessel in which wine was preserved; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-3.htm">1 Samuel 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-18.htm">1 Samuel 25:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-1.htm">2 Samuel 16:1</a>. It was at first made of the &#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;  bero&#770;sh or fir; afterward it was made of the almug tree, and occasionally it seems to have been made of metal; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-8.htm">1 Chronicles 13:8</a>. The external parts of the instrument were of wood, over which strings were drawn in various ways. Josephus says it had twelve strings ("Ant." B. viii. ch. x.) He says also that it was played with the fingers. - "Ibid." Hesychius and Pollux reckon it among stringed instruments. The resonance had its origin in the vessel or the bottom part of the instrument, upon which the strings were drawn. According to Ovid, this instrument was played on with both hands:<p>Quaravis mutus erat, voci favisse putatur<p>Piscis, Aroniae fabula nora lyrae.<p>Disce etiam duplice genialia palma<p>Verrere.<p>De Arte Amandi, lib. iii.327.<p>According to Jerome, Isodorus, and Cassiodorus, it had the form of an inverted Greek Delta &#x3b4;  d. Pfeiffer supposes that this instrument was probably the same as is found represented on ancient monument. The belly of the instrument is a wooden bowl, having a small hole in the under part, and is covered over with a stretched skin, which is higher in the middle than at the sides. Two posts, which are fastened together at the top by a cross piece, pass obliquely through this skin. Five strings pass over this skin, having a bridge for their support on the cross piece. The instrument has no pins or screws, but every string is fastened by means of some linen wound with it around this cross piece. The description of this instrument is furnished by Niebuhr ("Thess." i. p. 179). It is played on in two ways, either by being struck with the finger, or by a piece of leather, or perhaps a quill hung at its side and drawn across the strings. It cannot with certainty be determined when this instrument was invented, or when it came into use among the Hebrews. It is first mentioned in the time of Saul <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>, and from this time onward it is frequently mentioned in the Old Testament. It was used particularly in the public worship of God; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-12.htm">1 Kings 10:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-28.htm">2 Chronicles 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-25.htm">2 Chronicles 29:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-5.htm">1 Chronicles 16:5</a>. It was usually accompanied with other instruments, and was also used in festivals and entertainments; see "Bib. Repos." vol. vi. pp. 357-365. The usual form of representing it is shown in the preceding cut, and is the form in which the lyre appears on ancient monuments, in connection with the statues of Apollo.<p>The drawing in the book is a representation of a lyre from a Jewish shekel of the time of Simon Maccabeus, and may have been, not improbably, a form in frequent use among the Jews.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

"Put an end:" ba&#770;tha&#770;h ( equals  batta&#770;h : Ges. 67, Anm. 11) signifies, according to the primary meaning of ba&#770;thath (&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1514;, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-29.htm">Isaiah 1:29</a>), viz., abscindere, either abscissum  equals  locus abscissus or praeruptus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-19.htm">Isaiah 7:19</a>), or abscissio  equals  deletio. The latter is the meaning here, where sh&#305;&#772;th ba&#770;tha&#770;h is a refined expression for the more usual &#1499;&#1500;&#1492; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, both being construed with the accusative of the thing which is brought to an end. Further pruning and hoeing would do it no good, but only lead to further disappointment: it was the will of the Lord, therefore, that the deceitful vineyard should shoot up in thorns and thistles (a&#770;la&#770;h is applied to the soil, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-13.htm">Isaiah 34:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-31.htm">Proverbs 24:31</a>; sha&#770;imr va&#770;shaith, thorns and thistles, are in the accusative, according to Ges. 138, 1, Anm. 2; and both the words themselves, and also their combination, are exclusively and peculiarly Isaiah's).<p>(Note: Cassel associates sha&#770;mir as the name of a plant (saxifraga) with &#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, and shaith with sentis, &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;; but the name sha&#770;mir is not at all applicable to those small delicate plants, which are called saxifraga (stone-breakers) on account of their growing out of clefts in the rock, and so appearing to have split the rock itself. Both sha&#770;mir va&#770;shaith and ko&#772;ts v'dardar, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>, seem rather to point to certain kinds of rhamnus, together with different kinds of thistles. The more arid and waste the ground is, the more does it abound, where not altogether without vegetation, in thorny, prickly, stunted productions.)<p>In order that it might remain a wilderness, the clouds would also receive commandment from the Lord not to rain upon it. There can be no longer any doubt who the Lord of the vineyard is. He is Lord of the clouds, and therefore the Lord of heaven and earth. It is He who is the prophet's beloved and dearest one. The song which opened in so minstrel-like and harmless a tone, has now become painfully severe and terribly repulsive. The husk of the parable, which has already been broken through, now falls completely off (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-13.htm">Matthew 22:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-30.htm">Matthew 25:30</a>). What it sets forth in symbol is really true. This truth the prophet establishes by an open declaration. </body></html>
