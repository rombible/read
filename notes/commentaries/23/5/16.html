The “Holy One of Israel” was, we must remember, the name, of all Divine names, in which Israel most delighted, the ever-recurring burden of all the prophet’s utterances.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:8-23 Here is a woe to those who set their hearts on the wealth of the world. Not that it is sinful for those who have a house and a field to purchase another; but the fault is, that they never know when they have enough. Covetousness is idolatry; and while many envy the prosperous, wretched man, the Lord denounces awful woes upon him. How applicable to many among us! God has many ways to empty the most populous cities. Those who set their hearts upon the world, will justly be disappointed. Here is woe to those who dote upon the pleasures and the delights of sense. The use of music is lawful; but when it draws away the heart from God, then it becomes a sin to us. God's judgments have seized them, but they will not disturb themselves in their pleasures. The judgments are declared. Let a man be ever so high, death will bring him low; ever so mean, death will bring him lower. The fruit of these judgments shall be, that God will be glorified as a God of power. Also, as a God that is holy; he shall be owned and declared to be so, in the righteous punishment of proud men. Those are in a woful condition who set up sin, and who exert themselves to gratify their base lusts. They are daring in sin, and walk after their own lusts; it is in scorn that they call God the Holy One of Israel. They confound and overthrow distinctions between good and evil. They prefer their own reasonings to Divine revelations; their own devices to the counsels and commands of God. They deem it prudent and politic to continue profitable sins, and to neglect self-denying duties. Also, how light soever men make of drunkenness, it is a sin which lays open to the wrath and curse of God. Their judges perverted justice. Every sin needs some other to conceal it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the mean man ... the mighty man - The expressions here mean that "all" ranks would be subdued and punished; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-9.htm">Isaiah 2:9</a>.<p>The eyes of the lofty ... - see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-17.htm">Isaiah 2:17</a>, note.<p>Shall be exalted in judgment - In his justice; he shall so manifest his justice as to be exalted in the view of tbe people.<p>Shall be sanctified - Shall be "regarded" as holy.

By the "Lord of hosts" is meant Christ, the Lord of the armies, and of the inhabitants of the earth, of angels, and of men; who, though in our nature, in his state of humiliation, was brought very low, yet is now highly exalted; and which exaltation of his is seen and known, as it is here foretold it should be, by his judgments inflicted on the Jewish nation, for their contempt and rejection of him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a> so Kimchi interprets judgment of the judgment which the Lord would inflict on the ungodly of Israel: thus Christ's exaltation is seen in their humiliation, and his kingdom and power in their destruction: <p>and God that is holy; Christ is truly and properly God, God over all, blessed for ever; and he is holy, both as God and man; as God he is essentially and perfectly holy; and, as man, without sin original or actual; he is the Holy One of God, and the Holy One of Israel; and of him it is said, he <p>shall be sanctified in righteousness, or be declared to be holy; by the obedience and righteousness of his life, wrought out for his people, whereby he becomes their sanctification and righteousness; and by his justice, in punishing his and his people's enemies. Were all this to be understood of Jehovah the Father, it might very well be interpreted, as it is by Cocceius, of his being exalted and honoured by the condemnation of sin in the flesh of Christ; and of his being "glorified", as the Arabic version renders it, by the obedience and righteousness of his son, whereby his justice is satisfied, and his law magnified, and made honourable; and by the faith of his people, laying hold on that righteousness, and receiving it to the glory of God; in all which the purity, holiness, and justice of God appears. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">God that is holy</span> …] the <span class="bld">Holy God sanctifies Himself through righteousness</span>.

For ten yokes of vineyard will yield one pailful, and a quarter of seed-corn will produce a bushel." We may see from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-14.htm">Isaiah 22:14</a> in what sense the prophet wrote the substantive clause, "Into mine ears," or more literally, "In mine ears is Jehovah Zebaoth," viz., He is here revealing Himself to me. In the pointing, &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497; is written with tiphchah as a pausal form, to indicate to the reader that the boldness of the expression is to be softened down by the assumption of an ellipsis. In Hebrew, "to say into the ears" did not mean to "speak softly and secretly," as <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-10.htm">Genesis 23:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-16.htm">Genesis 23:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-8.htm">Job 33:8</a>, and other passages, clearly show; but to speak in a distinct and intelligible manner, which precludes the possibility of any misunderstanding. The prophet, indeed, had not Jehovah standing locally beside him; nevertheless, he had Him objectively over against his own personality, and was well able to distinguish very clearly the thoughts and words of his own personality, from the words of Jehovah which arose audibly within him. These words informed him what would be the fate of the rich and insatiable landowners. "Of a truth:" &#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1500;&#1488; (if not) introduces an oath of an affirmative character (the complete formula is Chai ani 'im-lo', "as I live if not"), just as 'im (if) alone introduces a negative oath (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-23.htm">Numbers 14:23</a>). The force of the expression 'im-lo' extends not only to rabbim, as the false accentuation with gershayim (double-geresh) would make it appear, but to the whole of the following sentence, as it is correctly accentuated with rebia in the Venetian (1521) and other early editions. A universal desolation would ensue: rabbim (many) does not mean less than all; but the houses (ba&#770;ttim, as the word should be pronounced, notwithstanding Ewald's objection to Khler's remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-2.htm">Zechariah 14:2</a>; cf., <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-1.htm">Job 2:1-13</a> :31) constituted altogether a very large number (compare the use of the word "many" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>, etc.). &#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; is a double, and therefore an absolute, negation (so that there is not, no inhabitant, i.e., not any inhabitant at all). <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-10.htm">Isaiah 5:10</a>, which commences, with Ci, explains how such a desolation of the houses would be brought about: failure of crops produces famine, and this is followed by depopulation. "Ten zimde&#772; (with dagesh lene, Ewald) of vineyard" are either ten pieces of the size that a man could plough in one day with a yoke of oxen, or possibly ten portions of yoke-like espaliers of vines, i.e., of vines trained on cross laths (the vina jugata of Varro), which is the explanation adopted by Biesenthal. But if we compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-14.htm">1 Samuel 14:14</a>, the former is to be preferred, although the links are wanting which would enable us to prove that the early Israelites had one and the same system of land measure as the Romans;<p>(Note: On the jugerum, see Hultsch, Griechische und rmische Metrologie, 1862. The Greek plethron, which was smaller by two and a half, corresponded to some extent to this; also the Homeric tetraguon, which cannot be more precisely defined (according to Eustathius, it was a piece of land which a skilful labourer could plough in one day). According to Herod. ii. 168, in the Egyptian square-measure an a'roura was equal to 150 cubits square. The Palestinian, according to the tables of Julian the Ashkalonite, was the plethron. "The plethron," he says, "was ten perches, or fifteen fathoms, or thirty paces, sixty cubits, ninety feet" (for the entire text, see L. F. V. Fennersberg's Untersuchungen ber alte Langen-, Feld-, und Wegemaase, 1859). Fennersberg's conclusion is, that the tzemed was a plethron, equal in length to ten perches of nine feet each. But the meaning of the word tzemed is of more importance in helping to determine the measure referred to, than the tables of long measure of the architect of Ashkalon, which have been preserved in the imperial collection of laws of Constantine Harmenopulos, and which probably belong to a much later period.)<p>nevertheless Arab. fdda&#770;n (in Hauran) is precisely similar, and this word signifies primarily a yoke of oxen, and then a yoke (jugerum) regarded as a measure of land. Ten days' work would only yield a single bath. This liquid measure, which was first introduced in the time of the kings, corresponded to the ephah in dry measure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-11.htm">Ezekiel 45:11</a>). According to Josephus (Ant. viii. 2, 9), it was equal to seventy-two Roman sextarii, i.e., a little more than thirty-three Berlin quarts; but in the time of Isaiah it was probably smaller. The homer, a dry measure, generally called a Cor after the time of the kings, was equal to ten Attic medimnoi;<p>(Note: Or rather 7 1/2 Attic medimnoi  equals  10 Attic metretoi  equals  45 Roman modia (see Bckh, Metrologische Untersuchungen, p. 259).)<p>a medimnos being (according to Josephus, Ant. xv 9, 2) about 15-16ths of a Berlin bushel, and therefore a little more than fifteen pecks. Even if this quantity of corn should be sown, they would not reap more than an ephah.The harvest, therefore, would only yield the tenth part of the sowing, since an ephah was the tenth part of a homer, or three seahs, the usual minimum for one baking (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-33.htm">Matthew 13:33</a>). It is, of course, impossible to give the relative measure exactly in our translation. </body></html>
