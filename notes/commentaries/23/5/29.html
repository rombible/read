Sin weakens the strength, the root of a people; it defaces the beauty, the blossoms of a people. When God's word is despised, and his law cast away, what can men expect but that God should utterly abandon them? When God comes forth in wrath, the hills tremble, fear seizes even great men. When God designs the ruin of a provoking people, he can find instruments to be employed in it, as he sent for the Chaldeans, and afterwards the Romans, to destroy the Jews. Those who would not hear the voice of God speaking by his prophets, shall hear the voice of their enemies roaring against them. Let the distressed look which way they will, all appears dismal. If God frowns upon us, how can any creature smile? Let us diligently seek the well-grounded assurance, that when all earthly helps and comforts shall fail, God himself will be the strength of our hearts, and our portion for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Their roaring ... - Their battle cry, or their shout as they enter into an engagement. Such a "shout," or cry, was common at the commencement of a battle. War was very much a personal conflict; and they expected to accomplish much by making it as frightful and terrible as possible. A shout served not only to excite their own spirits, but to produce an impression of their numbers and courage, and to send dismay into the opposite ranks. Such "shouts" are almost always mentioned by Homer, and by other writers, in their accounts of battles. They are often mentioned, also, in the Old Testament; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-18.htm">Exodus 32:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-10.htm">Joshua 6:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-16.htm">Joshua 6:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-20.htm">Joshua 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-15.htm">Jeremiah 50:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-20.htm">1 Samuel 17:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-52.htm">1 Samuel 17:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-15.htm">2 Chronicles 13:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-25.htm">Job 39:25</a>.<p>Like a lion - This comparison is common in the Bible; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-38.htm">Jeremiah 51:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-10.htm">Hosea 11:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-4.htm">Amos 3:4</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-24.htm">Numbers 23:24</a>.<p>Like young lions - This variation of the expression, from the lion to the young lion, is very common. It is the Hebrew form of poetry, where the second member expresses little more than the first. Here the description is that of a lion, or more probably a "lioness" and her whelps, all ravenous, and all uniting in roaring for prey. The idea is, that the army that would come up would be greedy of plunder; they would rush on to rapine in a frightful manner. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. roaring&#8212;their battle cry.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They shall roar like young lions; </span> which signifies both their cruelty, and their greediness and eagerness to catch and devour the prey. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">None; </span> neither the Jews themselves, nor the Egyptians, to whose help they will trust, nor any of their confederates. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Their roaring shall be like a lion,.... When engaged in war, just seizing on their prey. The phrase denotes their fierceness and cruelty, and the horror they should inject into the hearts of their enemies: <p>they shall roar like young lions; that are hungry, and almost famished, and in sight of their prey; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/4-10.htm">Job 4:10</a>, <p>yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey; seize it with great noise and greediness: <p>and shall carry it away safe; into their own den, the country from whence they come: <p>and none shall deliver it; this shows that respect is had; not to the Babylonish captivity, from whence there was a deliverance in a few years; but the Roman captivity, from thence there is no deliverance as yet to this day. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Their roaring <i>shall be</i> like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry <i>it</i> away safe, and none shall deliver <i>it</i>.</span><p>(i) By which is declared the cruelty of the enemy.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">29</span>. <span class="ital">Their roaring</span> …] Or, <span class="bld">he has a roar like that of a lioness, he roars like young lions and growls seizing the prey</span>, &c.

We see from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-23.htm">Isaiah 5:23</a> that the drinkers in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-22.htm">Isaiah 5:22</a> are unjust judges. The threat denounced against these is Isaiah's universal ceterum censeo; and accordingly it forms, in this instance also, the substance of his sixth and last woe. They are heroes; not, however, in avenging wrong, but in drinking wine; they are men of renown, though not for deciding between guilt and innocence, but for mixing up the ingredients of strong artistic wines. For the terms applied to such mixed wines, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-9.htm">Psalm 75:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-30.htm">Proverbs 23:30</a>, Sol 7:3. It must be borne in mind, however, that what is here called sheca&#770;r was not, properly speaking, wine, but an artificial mixture, like date wine and cider. For such things as these they were noteworthy and strong; whereas they judged unjustly, and took bribes that they might consume the reward of their injustice in drink and debauchery (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-5.htm">Proverbs 31:5</a>). "For reward:" e&#772;keb (Arab. &#8219;ukb; different from a&#770;ke&#772;b, a heel,  equals  &#8219;akib) is an adverbial accusative, "in recompense," or "for pay." "From him" (mimmennu) is distributive, and refers back to tsaddikim (the righteous); as, for example, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-8.htm">Hosea 4:8</a>. </body></html>
