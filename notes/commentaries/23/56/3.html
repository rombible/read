It is scarcely probable, however, that the household of Hezekiah would have been supplied with home-born eunuchs, and, on the hypothesis which I have adopted, I find in the eunuchs a sub-section of the proselytes.

Spiritual blessings are unspeakably better than having sons and daughters; for children are a care, and may prove a grief and shame, but the blessings we partake of in God's house, are comforts which cannot be made bitter. Those who love the Lord truly, will serve him faithfully, and then his commandments are not grievous. Three things are promised. Assistance: I will not only bid them welcome, but incline them to come. Acceptance, and comfort: though they came mourning to the house of prayer, they shall go away rejoicing. They shall find ease by casting their cares and burdens upon God. Many a sorrowful spirit has been made joyful in the house of prayer. The Gentiles shall be one body with the Jews, that, as Christ says, Joh 10:16, there may be one fold and one Shepherd.

A Gentile, that is so by birth, the son of one that is an alien from the commonwealth of Israel, a stranger from the covenants of promise, and so had no right to come into the congregation of the Lord under the former dispensation; but now the middle wall of partition being broken down, in the times to which this prophecy belongs, such are encouraged to expect admission: <p>that hath joined himself to the Lord; who, having a spiritual knowledge of him in Christ, loves him, believes in him, gives up himself to him, to walk in his ways and ordinances, and cleaves unto him with full purpose of heart; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-5.htm">Isaiah 44:5</a> such an one should not speak, <p>saying, the Lord hath utterly separated me from his people; by a law of his, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3</a>, for now the wall of separation, the ceremonial law, is destroyed, and God declares himself to be the God of the Gentiles, as well as of the Jews; and of all that fear God, and believe in Christ, of every nation, who are accepted with him; and that they are all one in Christ, and all partakers of the same promises and blessings; so strangers, and the sons of strangers, were to have an inheritance among the children of Israel in Gospel times; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-22.htm">Ezekiel 47:22</a> and therefore should have no reason to speak after this manner: <p>neither let the eunuch say, behold, I am a dry tree; having no children, nor could have any; and to be written childless was reckoned a reproach and a curse; nor might an eunuch enter the congregation of the Lord, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-1.htm">Deuteronomy 23:1</a>, and yet such a man, having the grace of God, and acting agreeably to it, as in the following verse, should not distress himself on the above accounts. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/56.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Neither let the son of the foreigner, that <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> hath joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I <i>am</i> a dry tree.</span><p>(d) Let no one think himself unfit to receive the graces of the Lord: for the Lord will take away all impediments, and will forsake no one who will keep his true religion, and believe in him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/56.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">the son of the stranger</span> means simply the individual foreigner (R.V. <span class="bld">the stranger</span>), not one whose father was a foreigner.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">The Lord hath utterly separated</span>] Render with R.V., <span class="bld">will surely separate</span>.

This anxiety is hardly to be explained by the law of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/23-3.htm" title="An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever:...">Deuteronomy 23:3-8</a>; for the regulations there laid down apply only to Moabites, Ammonites, Egyptians and Edomites; and the general tendency of the legislation is in favour of the religious rights of proselytes. (See the exhaustive monograph of Bertholet, <span class="ital">Die Stellung der Israeliten und der Juden zu den Fremden</span>, 1896.) It is more likely that the immediate cause of apprehension was some manifestation of an exclusive and intolerant spirit amongst the leaders of the new Jerusalem.

During the depression of the Captivity these are not likely to have been many. Still, there were doubtless some; and these, who had embraced Judaism under such unfavourable circumstances, were entitled to special consideration. As Messianic hopes prevailed, and the time of restoration to Palestine drew near (ver. 1), they might naturally be afraid that they would not be looked upon as equals by the native Israelites, but would be made into a lower grade, if not even excluded. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath utterly separated me</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the Lord will utterly separate me.</span> They do not suppose it done, but think it will be done. <span class="cmt_word">The eunuch</span>. Isaiah had prophesied to Hezekiah that a certain number of his seed should serve as eunuchs in the royal   palace of the King of Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-18.htm">2 Kings 20:18</a>). Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were such persons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-3.htm">Daniel 1:3-6</a>), and there may have been others. By the letter of the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-1.htm">Deuteronomy 23:1</a>), they were cut off from the congregation, but practically it would seem that during the Captivity they were on a par with other Israelites. These persons feared, with more reason than the foreign proselytes, that, on the return of Israel to their own land, a stricter practice would be established than had prevailed during the Captivity, and the letter of the Law would be enforced against them. I am a dry tree. Therefore useless, and entitled to no consideration at all. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/55.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This is set forth under a figure drawn from the rain and the snow. "For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, till it has moistened the earth, and fertilized it, and made it green, and offered seed to the sower and bread to the eater; so will my word be which goeth forth out of my mouth: it will not return to me fruitless, till it has accomplished that which I willed, and prosperously carried out that for which I sent it." The rain and snow come down from the sky, and return not thither till they have .... The perfects after &#1488;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; are all to be understood as such (Ewald, 356, a). Rain and snow return as vapour to the sky, but not without having first of all accomplished the purpose of their descent. And so with the word of Jehovah, which goeth forth out of His mouth (&#1497;&#1510;&#1488;, not &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>, because it is thought of as still going on in the preaching of the prophet): it will not return without having effected its object, i.e., without having accomplished what was Jehovah's counsel, or "good pleasure" - without having attained the end for which it was sent by Jehovah (constr. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-22.htm">2 Samuel 11:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-6.htm">1 Kings 14:6</a>). The word is represented in other places as the messenger of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-20.htm">Psalm 107:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-15.htm">Psalm 147:15</a>.). The personification presupposes that it is not a mere sound or letter. As it goeth forth out of the mouth of God it acquires shape, and in this shape is hidden a divine life, because of its divine origin; and so it runs, with life from God, endowed with divine power, supplied with divine commissions, like a swift messenger through nature and the world of man, there to melt the ice, as it were, and here to heal and to save; and does not return from its course till it has given effect to the will of the sender. This return of the word to God also presupposes its divine nature. The will of God, which becomes concrete and audible in the word, is the utterance of His nature, and is resolved into that nature again as soon as it is fulfilled. The figures chosen are rich in analogies. As snow and rain are the mediating causes of growth, and therefore the enjoyment of what is reaped; so is the soil of the human heart softened, refreshed, and rendered productive or prolific by the word out of the mouth of Jehovah; and this word furnishes the prophet, who resembles the sower, with the seed which he scatters, and brings with it bread which feeds the souls: for every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God is bread (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>). </body></html>
