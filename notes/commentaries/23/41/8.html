The idea embodied in the term is that of a calling and election, manifested now in Israel according to the flesh, now in the true Israel of God, realising its ideal, now, as in the innermost of the three concentric circles, in a person who gathers up that ideal in all its intensity into himself. The three phrases find their parallel in St. Paul’s language as to (1) the seed of Abraham according to the flesh; (2) the true seed who are heirs of the faith of Abraham; (3) <span class= "ital">the </span>seed, which is none other than the Christ Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-7.htm" title="Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall your seed be called.">Romans 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-7.htm" title="Know you therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.">Galatians 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-16.htm" title="Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He said not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ.">Galatians 3:16</a>). Here we have the national aspect, Israel as he is in the idea of God. So in the later language of Christian thought we have (1) the visible Church falling short of the ideal; (2) the spiritual Church approximating to the ideal; (3) Christ Himself, as identified with His people.<p><span class= "bld">The seed of Abraham my friend.</span>—The word for “friend” implies loving as well as being loved.

The Lord did so with Abraham, or rather, he would do so with Cyrus. Sinners encourage one another in the ways of sin; shall not the servants of the living God stir up one another in his service? God's people are the seed of Abraham his friend. This is certainly the highest title ever given to a mortal. It means that Abraham, by Divine grace, was made like to God, and that he was admitted to communion with Him. Happy are the servants of the Lord, whom he has called to be his friends, and to walk with him in faith and holy obedience.

Those who relied on idols were trusting to that which could not aid them. But those who trusted in him were safe. For their protection he had raised up Cyrus, for this purpose he had subdued the nations before him. God now expresses to them the assurance that though the nations should be destroyed, yet that he had chosen them, and would remember them, and his promise made to Abraham, their illustrious ancestor. The word 'servant' here is used in a mild and gentle sense, not to denote bondage or slavery, but to denote that they had been engaged in his service, and that he regarded them as subject to his laws, and as under his protection.<p>Jacob whom I have chosen - The descendants of Jacob, whom I have selected to be my people. Abraham my friend. Hebrew, 'Loving me,' my lover. Abraham was regarded as the friend of God (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-7.htm">2 Chronicles 20:7</a>). 'And he was called the Friend of God' <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-23.htm">James 2:23</a>. This most honorable appellation he deserved by a life of devoted piety, and by habitually submitting himself to the will of God. The idea in this verse is, that as they were the descendants of his friend, God deemed himself bound to protect and deliver them according to his gracious promises; and this is one of the many instances where the divine favor is manifested to descendants in consequence of the piety and prayers of their ancestors. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

The title is used in its simplest and widest sense, being applied to the nation as a whole, although of course in its ideal aspect, as it exists in the mind of Jehovah. The idea, however, is already a complex one, although the writer does not as yet analyse it into its different elements. (See Introduction, p. xxxi.) The one fact emphasized in this passage is the irrevocable choice or election of God, by which Israel was from its origin in Abraham constituted His servant. Cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-10.htm" title="You are my witnesses, said the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that you may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.">Isaiah 43:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-1.htm" title="Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:">Isaiah 44:1</a> f., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-7.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation abhors, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose you.">Isaiah 49:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">seed of Abraham my friend</span>] (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-7.htm" title="Are not you our God, who did drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and gave it to the seed of Abraham your friend for ever?">2 Chronicles 20:7</a>) lit. “my lover”: but as Duhm remarks Heb. has no single word to express the reciprocal relation of friendship as distinct from companionship.

The eye of the prophet travels perhaps, in part, beyond the period of the Captivity; but he is mainly bent on giving the people grounds of comfort and trust during that trying time. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Israel...   my servant</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-1.htm">Isaiah 44:1, 2, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-4.htm">Isaiah 45:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-3.htm">Isaiah 49:3-6</a>, etc.). The title characterizes these later chapters, and, while standing no doubt in some special relation to the "Servant of Jehovah" who is the subject of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-5.htm">Isaiah 49:5-7</a>, etc., is perhaps mainly selected, and dwelt on, to console Israel in captivity, when <span class="accented">servants</span> of the King of Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-20.htm">2 Chronicles 36:20</a>), by the thought that their true Master was God himself, and that to him, and him only, did they really belong. <span class="cmt_word">Jacob whom I have chosen</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-1.htm">Isaiah 44:1</a>).

The "friendship" intended comprised, no doubt, both an active and a passive element, but it is the active element which the word principally enforces. Abraham loved God, and showed his love by his obedience. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/41.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The parties invited are now to be thought of as present, and Jehovah commences in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a> : "Who hath raised up the man from the rising of the sun, whom justice meets at his foot, He giveth up nations before him, and kings He subdues, giveth men like the dust to his sword, and like driven stubble to his bow?" The sentence governed by "who" (m&#305;&#772;) ends at leraglo&#772; (at his foot); at the same time, all that follows is spoken with the echo of the interrogative accent. The person raised up is Cyrus, who is afterwards mentioned by name. The coming one (if, that is to say, we adhere to the belief in Isaiah's authorship of these addresses) first approaches gradually within the horizon of the prophet's ideal present; and it is only little by little that the prophet becomes more intimately acquainted with a phenomenon which belongs to so distant a future, and has been brought so close to his own eyes. Jehovah has raised up the new great hero "from the east" (mimmizra&#770;ch), and, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-25.htm">Isaiah 41:25</a>, "from the north" also. Both of these were fulfilled; for Cyrus was a Persian belonging to the clan of Achaemenes (Hakha&#770;manis), which stood at the head of the tribe, or of the Pasargadae. He was the son of Cambyses; and even if the Median princess Mandane were not his mother, yet, according to nearly all the ancient accounts, he was connected with the royal house of Media; at any rate, after Astyages was dethroned, he became head and chief of the Medes as well as of the Persians (hence the name of "Mule" which was give to him by the oracle, and that given by Jerome, "agitator bigae"). Now Media was to the north of Babylonia, and Persia to the east; so that his victorious march, in which, even before the conquest of Babylon, he subjugated all the lands from the heights of Hinduku to the shores of the Aegean Sea, had for its starting-point both the east and north.<p>(Note: See Pahl'es Geschichte des Oriental. Alterthums. (1864), p. 170ff.)<p>The clause &#1500;&#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1493; &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; is an attributive clause, and as such a virtual object: "him whom (supply &#1506;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;) justice comes to meet (&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;)  equals  &#1511;&#1512;&#1492;, Ges. 75, vi.) on his track" (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-30.htm">Genesis 30:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-11.htm">Job 18:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-5.htm">Habakkuk 3:5</a>). The idea of tsedeq is determined by what follows: Jehovah gives up nations before him, and causes kings to be trodden down (causative of ra&#770;da&#770;h). Accordingly, tsedeq is either to be understood here in an attributive sense, as denoting the justice exercised by a person (viz., the justice executed successfully by Cyrus, as the instrument of Jehovah, by the force of arms); or objectively of the justice awarded to a person (to which the idea of "meeting" is more appropriate), viz., the favourable result, the victory which procures justice for the just cause of the combatant. Rosenmller, Knobel, and others, are wrong in maintaining that tsedeq (tseda&#770;qa&#770;h) in chapters 40-66 signifies primarily justice, and the prosperity and salvation as its reward. The word means straightness, justice, righteousness, and nothing more (from tsa&#770;daq, to be hard, firm, extended, straight, e.g., rumh-un-tsadq, a hard, firm, and straight lance); but it has a double aspect, because justice consists, according to circumstances, of either wrath of favour, and therefore has sometimes the idea of the strict execution of justice, as in this instance, sometimes of a manifestation of justice in fidelity to promises, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>. &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; is repeated here in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a> (just like &#1493;&#1497;&#1500;&#1502;&#1491;&#1492;&#1493; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-14.htm">Isaiah 40:14</a>) with the same subject, but in a different sense. To make sword and bow the subject, in the sense of "his sword gives (sc., 'the foe')," is a doubtful thing in itself; and as cherebh and qesheth are feminines, it is by no means advisable. Moreover, in other instances, the comparative &#1499; leaves it to the reader to carry out the figure indicated according to his own fancy. And this is the case here: He (Jehovah) makes his sword as if there were dust, his bow as if there were hunted stubble (Bttcher), i.e., pounding the enemy like dust, and hunting it like flying stubble. Our text has &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1508;&#1512;, but in certain codices we find &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1508;&#1512; with tzere; and this reading, which is contrary to rule, has in its favour the express testimony of Moses the punctuator.<p>(Note: In his &#1492;&#1504;&#1511;&#1493;&#1491; &#1491;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497; (rules of pointing), with which the Masora finalis is surrounded.) </body></html>
