There is nothing in idols worthy of regard. They are less than nothing, and worse than nothing. Let the advocates of other doctrines than that of salvation through Christ, bring their arguments. Can they tell of a cure for human depravity? Jehovah has power which cannot be withstood; this he will make appear. But the certain knowledge of the future must be only with Jehovah, who fulfils his own plans. All prophecies, except those of the Bible, have been uncertain. In the work of redemption the Lord showed himself much more than in the release of the Jews from Babylon. The good tidings the Lord will send in the gospel, is a mystery hid from ages and generations. A Deliverer is raised up for us, of nobler name and greater power than the deliverer of the captive Jews. May we be numbered among his obedient servants and faithful friends.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Produce your cause - This address is made to the same persons who are referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-1.htm">Isaiah 41:1</a> - the worshippers of idols; and the prophet here returns to the subject with reference to a further argument on the comparative power of Yahweh and idols. In the former part of the chapter, God had urged his claims to confidence from the fact that he had raised up Cyrus; that the idols were weak and feeble compared with him; and from the fact that it was his fixed purpose to defend his people, and to meet and refresh them when faint and weary. In the verses which follow <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-21.htm">Isaiah 41:21</a>, he urges his claims to confidence from the fact that he alone was able to predict future events, and calls on the worshippers of idols to show their claims in the same manner. This is the 'cause' which is now to be tried.<p>Bring forth your strong reasons - Adduce the arguments which you deem to be of the greatest strength and power (compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-1.htm">Isaiah 41:1</a>). The object is, to call on them to bring forward the most convincing demonstration on which they relied, of their power and their ability to save. The argument to which God appeals is, that he had foretold future events. He calls on them to show that they had given, or could give, equal demonstration of their divinity. Lowth regards this as a call on the idol-gods to come forth in person and show their strength. But the interpretation which supposes that it refers to their reasons, or arguments, accords better with the parallelism, and with the connection. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

The argument is now taken up from vers. 1-4. Jehovah and his worshippers are on the one side; the idol-gods and their votaries on the other. The direct challenge, however, is given by Jehovah himself to the idols: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> What predictions of their own can they bring forward as proofs of supernatural knowledge? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> What indications can they give of power either to do good or to do evil (vers. 22, 23)? If they can do neither, they are vanity (ver. 24). Jehovah has both reared up Cyrus he and he only - and has announced the good tidings to his people (vers. 25-27). No such announcement has been made by the idol-gods; they are therefore mere "wind and confusion" (vers. 28, 29). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Produce your cause</span>. The nations had been told to "draw near" - to "keep silence" while God spoke - and "then to speak" (ver. 1).

The king and tutelary god of the nation, Israel, really holding the position that the idol-gods were regarded as holding towards the peoples that worshipped them. The "kingly" character of the idol-gods was indicated in such names as Moloch (equivalent to "king"), Melkarth (equivalent to "king of the city"), Adrammelech (equivalent to "glorious king"), Baal (equivalent to "lord"), Adonis (equivalent to "my lord"), etc. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/41.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The consolatory words, "Fear not," are now repeated, for the purpose of once more adding the promise that Israel will not succumb to its foes, but will acquire power over its enemies. "Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and handful Israel: I will help thee, saith Jehovah; and thy Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel. Behold, I have made thee a threshing roller, a sharp new one, with double edges: thou wilt thresh mountains, and pound them; and hills thou wilt make like chaff. Thou wilt winnow them, and wind carries them away, and tempest scatters them: and thou wilt rejoice in Jehovah, and glory in the Holy One of Israel." Israel, which is now helplessly oppressed, is called "worm of Jacob" (gen. appos.) in compassion, i.e., Jacob that is like a worm, probably with some allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7</a>; for the image of the Messiah enriches itself in these discourses, inasmuch as Israel itself is looked upon in a Messianic light, so that the second David does not stand by the side of Israel, but appears as Israel's heart, or true and inmost essence. The people are then addressed as the "people of Israel," with some allusion to the phrase &#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1514;&#1497; (i.e., few men, easily numbered) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-27.htm">Deuteronomy 4:27</a> (lxx &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c3; &#787;&#x399;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;; Luther, Ir armer hauffe Israel, ye poor crowd of Israel). They no longer formed the compact mass of a nation; the band of the commonwealth was broken: they were melted down into a few individuals, scattered about hither and thither. But it would not continue so. "I help thee" (perfect of certainty) is Jehovah's solemn declaration; and the Redeemer (redemtor, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-48.htm">Leviticus 25:48-49</a>) of His now enslaved people is the Holy One of Israel, with His love, which perpetually triumphs over wrath. Not only will He set it free, but He will also endow it with might over its oppressors; samt&#305;&#772;kh is a perfect of assurance (Ges. 126, 4); mo&#772;rag (roller) signifies a threshing-sledge (Arab. naureg, no&#772;reg), which has here the term &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-27.htm">Isaiah 28:27</a>) as a secondary name along with &#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, and is described as furnished on the under part of the two arms of the sledge not only with sharp knives, but with two-edged knives (&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; a reduplication, like &#1502;&#1488;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-8.htm">Isaiah 27:8</a>, whereas &#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; is a double plural). Just like such a threshing machine would Israel thresh and grind to powder from that time forth both mountains and hills. This is evidently a figurative expression for proud and mighty foes, just as wind and tempest denote the irresistible force of Jehovah's aid. The might of the enemy would be broken down to the very last remnant, whereas Israel would be able to rejoice and glory in its God. </body></html>
