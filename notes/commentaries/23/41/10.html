Art thou weak? I will strengthen thee. Art thou in want of friends? I will help thee in the time of need. Art thou ready to fall? I will uphold thee with that right hand which is full of righteousness, dealing forth rewards and punishments. There are those that strive with God's people, that seek their ruin. Let not God's people render evil for evil, but wait God's time. It is the worm Jacob; so little, so weak, so despised and trampled on by every body. God's people are as worms, in humble thoughts of themselves, and in their enemies' haughty thoughts of them; worms, but not vipers, not of the serpent's seed. Every part of God's word is calculated to humble man's pride, and to make him appear little in his own eyes. The Lord will help them, for he is their Redeemer. The Lord will make Jacob to become a threshing instrument. God will make him fit for use, new, and having sharp spikes. This has fulfilment in the triumphs of the gospel of Christ, and of all faithful followers of Christ, over the power of darkness. God has provided comforts to supply all their wants, and to answer all their prayers. Our way to heaven lies through the wilderness of this world. The soul of man is in want, and seeks for satisfaction; but becomes weary of seeking that in the world, which is not to be had in it. Yet they shall have a constant supply, where one would least expect it. I will open rivers of grace, rivers of living water, which Christ spake of the Spirit, Joh 7:38,39. When God sets up his church in the Gentile wilderness, there shall be a great change, as if thorns and briers were turned into cedars, and fir-trees, and myrtles. These blessings are kept for the poor in spirit, who long for Divine enlightening, pardon, and holiness. And God will render their barren souls fruitful in the grace of his Spirit, that all who behold may consider it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Fear thou not - This verse is plain in its meaning, and is full of consolation. It is to be regarded as addressed primarily to the exiled Jews during their long and painful captivity in Babylon; and the idea is, that they who had been selected by God to be his special people had nothing to fear. But the promise is one that may be regarded as addressed to all his people in similar circumstances, and it is as true now as it was then, that those whom God has chosen have nothing to fear.<p>For I am with thee - This is a reason why they should not be afraid. God was their protector, and of whom should they be afraid. 'If God be for us, who can be against us?' What higher consolation can man desire than the assurance that he is with him to protect him?<p>Be not dismayed - The word rendered here 'dismayed' (&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1506;  t&#305;&#770;shetta&#8219;) is derived from &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492;  sha&#770;&#8219;a&#770;h, "to see, to look"; and then to look about as one does in a state of alarm, or danger. The sense here is, that they should be calm, and under no apprehension from their foes.<p>For I am thy God - I am able to preserve and strengthen thee. The God of heaven was their God; and as he had all power, and that power was pledged for their protection, they had nothing to fear.<p>I will uphold thee - I will enable you to bear all your trials.<p>With the right hand of my righteousness - With my faithful right hand. The phrase is a Hebrew mode of expression, meaning that God's hand was faithful, that it might be relied on, and would secure them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. be not dismayed&#8212;literally, anxiously to look at one another in dismay.<p>right hand of my righteousness&#8212;that is, My right hand prepared in accordance with My righteousness (faithfulness to My promises) to uphold thee.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/41.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Which I do and will manage with righteousness, whereby I will deliver thee, and destroy thine and mine enemies, as it follows. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/41.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Fear thou not, for I am with thee,.... Not merely by his essence or power, who is every where; or by his providence supporting, preserving, observing, ordering, and overruling all things; but in a way of special grace, to guard and protect his people, support and supply them, comfort and strengthen their hearts; wherefore they need not fear any of their enemies, nor whatsoever they may be called to suffer for his name's sake, even though they pass through fire and water, and the valley of the shadow of death: <p>be not dismayed, I am thy God; through Christ, in a covenant way, as appeared by the effectual calling of them; and therefore might depend on his love, be sure of his power, expect all needful supplies, and to be comfortably carried through every service and trial they were called unto; and need fear no enemies, or be dismayed at anything that should befall them; or become weak as water, and their hearts melt like wax within them, as the Jewish commentators generally interpret the word (n). The Targum is, <p>"be not broken;'' <p>in spirit. The word signifies to look about, as persons in distress, and amazed: <p>I will strengthen thee; with strength in their souls, to perform duties, exercise grace, withstand corruptions, resist temptations, bear afflictions, suffer persecutions, and do their generation work, according to the will of God; and if God is the strength of his people, they need not be afraid of any persons or things, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>, <p>yea, I will help thee; help them out of all their afflictions and temptations, and out of the hands of all their enemies; help them in the discharge of duty, in the exercise of grace, in bearing the cross, in fighting the Lord's battles, and in their journey to another world; help them to every mercy, temporal and spiritual, to all needful supplies of grace, and at last to glory; whose help is suitable and seasonable, and may be expected, since he is able to help, either with or without means; has promised to help his people, as here, and he is faithful that has promised; he has laid help on one that is mighty, and set up a throne of grace to come to for help in time of need; and seeing he is their helper, they need not fear what men or devils can do unto them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>. <p>I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness; either by his almighty power, or by his Son, the man of his right hand, made strong for himself, and the author of righteousness to his people: this is expressive of his sustentation of them, not merely in a providential way, but in a way of special grace; and of his powerful protection and preservation of them, so as that they shall stand in the grace of God, go on in his ways, and not fall finally and totally, but persevere to the end, though their trials and temptations may be great and many. <p>(n)  "neque dissolvaris", Munster; "vel ne liquefias", Vatablus.

This verse is most closely connected with the two preceding. The clauses in vers. 8, 9 are one and all vocative; here the verb follows. The whole passage is one of great tenderness. I am with thee (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6, 8</a>; and see above (vol. 1, p. 132), on the force of the word" Immanuel"). <span class="cmt_word">I will strengthen thee</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I have strengthened thee</span>, or I <span class="accented">have chosen thee</span> (Delitzsch, Cheyne). The two other verbs are also in the past tense. While primarily they declare past favours, they may also be regarded as prophetic of future ones, since "with God is no variableness.' <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/41.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The great fact of the present time, which not one of the gods of the heathen can boast of having brought to pass, is now explained. Jehovah is its author. "Who hath wrought and executed it? He who calleth the generations of men from the beginning, I Jehovah am first, and with the last am I He." The synonyms &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; and &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; are distinguished from each other in the same way as "to work" (or bring about) and "to realize" (or carry out). Hence the meaning is, Who is the author to whom both the origin and progress of such an occurrence are to be referred? It is He who "from the beginning," i.e., ever since there has been a human history, has called into existence the generations of men through His authoritative command. And this is no other than Jehovah, who can declare of Himself, in contrast with the heathen and their gods, who are of yesterday, and tomorrow will not be: I am Jehovah, the very first, whose being precedes all history; and with the men of the latest generations yet to come "I am it." &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; is not introduced here to strengthen the subject, ego ille "I and no other," as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-16.htm">Isaiah 37:16</a>, which see); but, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-10.htm">Isaiah 43:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-13.htm">Isaiah 43:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-4.htm">Isaiah 56:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-12.htm">Isaiah 48:12</a>, it is a predicate of the substantive clause, ego sum is (ille), viz., 'Elo&#772;h&#305;&#772;m; or even as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-28.htm">Psalm 102:28</a> (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-19.htm">Job 3:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>), ego sum idem (Hitzig). They are both included, without any distinction in the assertion. He is this, viz., God throughout all ages, and is through all ages He, i.e., the Being who is ever the same in this His deity. It is the full meaning of the name Jehovah which is unfolded here; for God is called Jehovah as the absolute I, the absolutely free Being, pervading all history, and yet above all history, as He who is Lord of His own absolute being, in revealing which He is purely self-determined; in a word, as the unconditionally free and unchangeably eternal personality. </body></html>
