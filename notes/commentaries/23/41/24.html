There is nothing in idols worthy of regard. They are less than nothing, and worse than nothing. Let the advocates of other doctrines than that of salvation through Christ, bring their arguments. Can they tell of a cure for human depravity? Jehovah has power which cannot be withstood; this he will make appear. But the certain knowledge of the future must be only with Jehovah, who fulfils his own plans. All prophecies, except those of the Bible, have been uncertain. In the work of redemption the Lord showed himself much more than in the release of the Jews from Babylon. The good tidings the Lord will send in the gospel, is a mystery hid from ages and generations. A Deliverer is raised up for us, of nobler name and greater power than the deliverer of the captive Jews.

This refers to idols; and the idea is, that they were utterly vain and powerless; they were as unable to render aid to their worshippers as absolute nothingness would be, and all their confidence in them was vain and foolish.<p>And your work - All that you do, or all that it is pretended that you do.<p>Of nought - Margin, 'Worse than a viper.' The word used here in the common Hebrew text (&#1488;&#1508;&#1506;  'epa&#8219;) occurs in no other place. Gesenius supposes that this is a corrupt reading for &#1488;&#1508;&#1505;  'epes (nothing), and so our translators have regarded it, and in this opinion most expositors agree. Hahn has adopted this reading in his Hebrew Bible. The Jewish rabbis suppose generally that the word &#1488;&#1508;&#1506;  'epa&#8219; is the same word as &#1488;&#1508;&#1506;&#1492;  'eph&#8219;eh, a viper, according to the reading in the margin. But this interpretation is contrary to the connection, as well as the ancient versions. The Vulgate and Chaldee render it, 'Of nought.' The Syriac renders it, 'Your works are of the sword.' This is probably one of the few instances in which there has been a corruption of the Hebrew text (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-17.htm">Isaiah 40:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-12.htm">Isaiah 41:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-19.htm">Isaiah 41:19</a>).<p>An abomination is he that chooseth you - They who select idols as the object of worship, and offer to them homage, are regarded as abominable by God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. of nothing&#8212;(See on [782]Isa 40:17).

Not as to the matter of them, for they were made of gold, silver, brass, &amp;c. but as to the divinity of them: there was none in them, they were of no worth and value; they could do nothing, either good or evil, either help their friends, or hurt their enemies; yea, they were less than nothing; for the words may be rendered by way of comparison, "behold, ye are less than nothing"; (a). See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-17.htm">Isaiah 40:17</a>; <p>and your work of nought; the workmanship bestowed on them, in casting or carving them, was all to no purpose, and answered no end; or the work they did, or pretended to do, their feigned oracles, and false predictions: or, "worse than nothing": some render it, "worse than a viper" (b); a word like this is used for one, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-5.htm">Isaiah 49:5</a> and so denotes the poisonous and pernicious effects of idolatry: <p>an abomination is he that chooseth you; as the object of his worship; he is not only abominable, but an abomination itself to God, and to all men of sense and religion; for the choice he makes of an idol to be his god shows him to be a man void of common sense and reason, and destitute of all true religion and godliness, and must be a stupid sottish creature. The Targum is, <p>"an abomination is that which ye have chosen for yourselves, or in which ye delight;'' <p>meaning their idols.

"The poor and needy, who seek for water and there is none, their tongue faints for thirst. I Jehovah will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them. I open streams upon hills of the field, and springs in the midst of the valleys; I make the desert into a pond, and dry land into fountains of water. I give in the desert cedars, acacias, and myrtles, and oleasters; I set in the steppe cypresses, plane-trees, and sherbin-trees together, that they may see, and know, and lay to heart and understand all together, that the hand of Jehovah hath accomplished this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it." Kimchi, Hitzig, and others refer these promises to the returning exiles; but there is also a description, without any restriction to the return home, of the miraculous change which would take place in the now comfortless and helpless condition of the exiles. The shepha&#770;y&#305;&#772;m, i.e., bare, woodless hills rising up from the plain, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-12.htm">Jeremiah 12:12</a>, the beqa&#770;&#8219;o&#772;th, or deep valleys, by the sides of which there rise precipitous mountains, and the 'erets tsiyya&#770;h, the land of burning heat or drought (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-2.htm">Psalm 63:2</a>), depict the homeless condition of Israel, as it wandered over bald heights and through waterless plains about a land with parched and gaping soil. For the characteristics of the object, which is placed before &#1488;&#1506;&#1504;&#1501;, we may therefore compare such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; is either a pausal form for &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, and therefore the niphal of &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1514; (to set, become shallow, dry up), or a pausal form for &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1492;, and therefore the kal of &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; with dagesh affectuosum, like &#1504;&#1514;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-19.htm">Ezekiel 27:19</a> (Olshausen, 83, b). The form &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-30.htm">Jeremiah 51:30</a> may just as well be derived from &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1514; (Ges. 67, Anm. 11) as from &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, whereas &#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468; may certainly be taken as the niphal of &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1514; after the form &#1504;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;, &#1504;&#1495;&#1512; (Ges. 67, Anm. 5), though it would be safer to refer it to a kal &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, which seems to be also favoured by &#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-14.htm">Jeremiah 18:14</a> as a transposition of &#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;. The root &#1504;&#1513;, of which &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; would be a further expansion, really exhibits the meaning to dry up or thirst, in the Arabic nassa; whereas the verbs &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;, &#1504;&#1505;&#1505; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-18.htm">Isaiah 10:18</a>), &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, Syr. nas', nos', Arab. na&#770;sa, nasnasa, with the primary meaning to slacken, lose their hold, and &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;, &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, &#1504;&#1505;&#1506;, to deceive, derange, and advance, form separate families. Just when they are thus on the point of pining away, they receive an answer to their prayer: their God opens streams, i.e., causes streams to break forth on the hills of the field, and springs in the midst of the valleys. The desert is transformed into a lake, and the steppe of burning sand into fountains of water. What was predicted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6-7</a> is echoed again here - a figurative representation of the manifold fulness of refreshing, consolation, and marvellous help which was to burst all at once upon those who were apparently forsaken of God. What is depicted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-19.htm">Isaiah 41:19</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-20.htm">Isaiah 41:20</a>, is the effect of these. It is not merely a scanty vegetation that springs up, but a corresponding manifold fulness of stately, fragrant, and shady trees; so that the steppe, where neither foot nor eye could find a resting-place, is changed, as by a stroke of magic, into a large, dense, well-watered forest, and shines with sevenfold glory - an image of the many-sided manifestations of divine grace which are experienced by those who are comforted now. Isaiah is especially fond of such figures as these (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-7.htm">Isaiah 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-13.htm">Isaiah 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-6.htm">Isaiah 27:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-31.htm">Isaiah 37:31</a>). There are seven (4 + 3) trees named; seven indicating the divine character of this manifold development (Psychol. p. 188). 'Erez is the generic name for the cedar; shitta&#770;h, the acacia, the Egyptian spina (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;), Copt. shont; hadas, the myrtle, &#8219;e&#772;ts shemen, the wild olive, as distinguished from zayith (&#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, opposed to &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a>); bero&#772;sh, the cypress, at any rate more especially this; tidha&#770;r we have rendered the "plane-tree," after Saad.; and te'asshu&#772;r the "sherbin" (a kind of cedar), after Saad. and Syr. The crowded synonyms indicating sensual and spiritual perception in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-20.htm">Isaiah 41:20</a> (&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;, sc. &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-22.htm">Isaiah 41:22</a>) are meant to express as strongly as possible the irresistible character of the impression. They will be quite unable to regard all this as accidental or self-produced, or as anything but the production of the power and grace of their God. </body></html>
