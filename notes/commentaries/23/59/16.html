It is generally thought to describe the coming of the Messiah, as the Avenger and Deliverer of his church. There was none to intercede with God to turn away his wrath; none to interpose for the support of justice and truth. Yet He engaged his own strength and righteousness for his people. God will make his justice upon the enemies of his church and people plainly appear. When the enemy threatens to bear down all without control, then the Spirit of the Lord shall stop him, put him to flight. He that has delivered, will still deliver. A far more glorious salvation is promised to be wrought out by the Messiah in the fulness of time, which all the prophets had in view. The Son of God shall come to us to be our Redeemer; the Spirit of God shall come to be our Sanctifier: thus the Comforter shall abide with the church for ever, Joh 14:16. The word of Christ will always continue in the mouths of the faithful; and whatever is pretended to be the mind of the Spirit, must be tried by the Scriptures. We must lament the progress of infidelity and impiety. But the cause of the Redeemer shall gain a complete victory even on earth, and the believer will be more than conqueror when the Lord receives him to his glory in heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/59.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he saw that there was no man - That is, no wise and prudent man qualified to govern the affairs of the people. Or, that there was no man qualified to interpose and put an end to these evils; no one qualified to effect a reformation, and to save the nation from the calamities which their sins deserved. The reason why God provided a Redeemer was, that such was the extent and nature of human depravity, that no one on earth could arrest it, and save the world. A similar expression occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-28.htm">Isaiah 41:28</a>.<p>And wondered - This is language adapted to the mode of speaking among men. It cannot be taken literally, as if God was amazed by suddenly coming to the knowledge of this fact. It is designed to express, with great emphasis, the truth, that there was no one to intercede, and that the wicked world was lying in a helpless condition.<p>That there was no intercessor - On the meaning of the word here rendered 'intercessor,' see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>. The Chaldee renders it, 'There was no man who could stand and pray for them.' In <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-5.htm">Isaiah 63:5</a>, Isaiah expresses the idea in the following language: I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold.'<p>Therefore his arm - On the meaning of this phrase, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-10.htm">Isaiah 40:10</a> (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-5.htm">Isaiah 51:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-5.htm">Isaiah 63:5</a>). The idea is, that salvation was to be traced to God alone. It did not originate with man, and it was not accomplished by his agency or help.<p>And his righteousness, it sustained him - Sustained by the consciousness that he was doing right, he went forward against all opposition, and executed his plan. This is language derived from the mode of speaking among people, and it means that as a man who is engaged in a righteous cause is sustained amidst much opposition by the consciousness of integrity, so it is with God. The cause of redemption is the great cause of righteousness on earth. In this cause the Redeemer was sustained by the consciousness that he was engaged in that which was designed to vindicate the interests of truth and justice, and to promote righteousness throughout the universe. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/59.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. no man&#8212;namely, to atone by his righteousness for the unrighteousness of the people.

Whose works are good, as the Targum adds; no good man, or faithful and righteous one, that had any regard to truth and justice; that was an advocate for truth, and opposed error, and set on foot a reformation; or was concerned for any of these things, and mourned over the general corruption; not that it must be thought there was not one individual person, but very few, comparatively none; since mention is made before of some that departed from evil, and made themselves a prey: <p>and wondered that there was no intercessor; to stand up, and pray for them, as the Targum; so it seems a spirit of prayer and supplication will be greatly wanting in the times of latter day darkness, and before latter day glory breaks out: or, "that there was no interposer" (h); none to appear on the side of truth and justice, and on the behalf of those that become a prey to others. "Wonder" is here ascribed to God by an anthropopathy, after the manner of men, as being a marvellous and surprising thing, and almost incredible, that none could be found in so good a cause, and taking the part of injured truth and righteousness; and it expresses the general corruption and defect of religion in those times; and shows that it is not for the goodness of men, or their merits, that the Lord will do what is next said he did: <p>therefore his arm brought salvation to him; either to himself, and which redounded to his own honour and glory; or to his people, those that became a prey to their enemies; these he rescued out of their hands, and by his own arm of power saved them; or he himself alone wrought out salvation for them, and delivered them from the insults, reproach, and persecution of men, under whatsoever name; so when antichrist, and antichristianism in every form, shall be destroyed, salvation will be ascribed to God alone, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-1.htm">Revelation 19:1</a>, <p>and his righteousness, it sustained him; his righteousness, in taking vengeance on his and his people's enemies; and his faithfulness, in the performance of his promises, will support him in, and carry him through, his work, though attended with difficulties that may seem insuperable to men: this may be understood of Christ, as well as what follows.

They now mourn over that state of exhaustion into which they have been brought through the perpetual straining and disappointment of expectation, and confess those sins on account of which the righteousness and salvation of Jehovah have been withheld. The prophet is speaking communicatively here; for even the better portion of the nation was involved in the guilt and consequences of the corruption which prevailed among the exiles, inasmuch as a nation forms an organized whole, and the delay of redemption really affected them. "Therefore right remains far from us, and righteousness does not overtake us; we hope for light, and behold darkness; for brightness - we walk in thick darkness. We grope along the wall like the blind, and like eyeless men we grope: we stumble in the light of noon-day as in the darkness, and among the living like the dead. We roar all like bears, and moan deeply like doves: we hope for right, and it cometh not; for salvation - it remaineth far off from us." At the end of this group of verses, again, the thought with which it sets out is palindromically repeated. The perfect &#1512;&#1495;&#1511;&#1492; denotes a state of things reaching from the past into the present; the future &#1514;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1497;&#1490;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; a state of things continuing unchangeable in the present. By mishpa&#770;t we understand a solution of existing inequalities or incongruities through the judicial interposition of God; by tseda&#770;qa&#770;h the manifestation of justice, which bestows upon Israel grace as its right in accordance with the plan of salvation after the long continuance of punishment, and pours out merited punishment upon the instruments employed in punishing Israel. The prophet's standpoint, whether a real or an ideal one, is the last decade of the captivity. At that time, about the period of the Lydian war, when Cyrus was making one prosperous stroke after another, and yet waited so long before he turned his arms against Babylon, it may easily be supposed that hope and despondency alternated incessantly in the minds of the exiles. The dark future, which the prophet penetrated in the light of the Spirit, was indeed broken up by rays of hope, but it did not amount to light, i.e., to a perfect lighting up (nego&#772;ho&#772;th, an intensified plural of nego&#772;ha&#770;h, like nekho&#772;cho&#772;th in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-10.htm">Isaiah 26:10</a>, pl. of nekho&#772;cha&#770;h in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-14.htm">Isaiah 59:14</a>); on the contrary, darkness was still the prevailing state, and in the deep thick darkness ('a&#774;phe&#772;lo&#772;th) the exiles pined away, without the promised release being effected for them by the oppressor of the nations. "We grope," they here complain, "like blind men by a wall, in which there is no opening, and like eyeless men we grope." &#1490;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473; (only used here) is a synonym of the older &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29</a>); &#1504;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; (with the elision of the reduplication, which it is hardly possible to render audible, and which comes up again in the pausal &#1504;&#1490;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;) has the a&#770;h of force, here of the impulse to self-preservation, which leads them to grope for an outlet in this &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;; and &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; is not quite synonymous with &#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, for there is such a thing as blindness with apparently sound eyes (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-8.htm">Isaiah 43:8</a>); and there is also a real absence of eyes, on account of either a natural malformation, or the actual loss of the eyes through either external injury or disease.<p>In the lamentation which follows, "we stumble in the light of noon-day (&#1510;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, meridies  equals  mesidies, the culminating point at which the eastern light is separated from the western) as if it were darkness, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, as if we were dead men," we may infer from the parallelism that since &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; must express some antithesis to &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, it cannot mean either in caliginosis (Jer., Luther, etc.), or "in the graves" (Targ., D. Kimchi, etc.), or "in desolate places" (J. Kimchi). Moreover, there is no such word in Hebrew as &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, to be dark, although the lexicographers give a Syriac word &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1502;&#1504;&#1488;, thick darkness (possibly related to Arab. &#8219;atamat, which does not mean the dark night, but late in the night); and the verb sha&#770;me&#772;n, to be fat, is never applied to "fat, i.e., thick darkness," as Knobel assumes, whilst the form of the word with &#1504; c. dagesh precludes the meaning a solitary place or desert (from &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501;). The form in question points rather to the verbal stem &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503;, which yields a fitting antithesis to &#1499;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, whether we explain it as meaning "in luxuriant fields," or "among the fat ones, i.e., those who glory in their abundant health." We prefer the latter, since the word mishmann&#305;&#772;m (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-24.htm">Daniel 11:24</a>; cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-28.htm">Genesis 27:28</a>) had already been coined to express the other idea; and as a rule, words formed with &#1488; prosth. point rather to an attributive than to a substantive idea. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; is a more emphatic form of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-29.htm">Judges 3:29</a>);<p>(Note: The name of the Phoenician god of health and prosperity, viz., Esmoun, which Alois Mller (Esmun, ein Beitrag zur Mythologie des orient. Alterthums. 1864) traces to &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-32.htm">Psalm 68:32</a>) from &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;  equals  &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, "the splendid one (illustris)," probably means "the healthy one, or one of full health" (after the form &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;), which agrees somewhat better with the account of Photios:  &#787;&#769;&#x395;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3a6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c9;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b7; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;.)<p>and &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; indicates indirectly the very same thing which is directly expressed by &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-16.htm">Isaiah 10:16</a>. Such explanations as "in opimis rebus" (Stier, etc.), or "in fatness of body, i.e., fulness of life" (Bttcher), are neither so suitable to the form of the word, nor do they answer to the circumstances referred to here, where all the people in exile are speaking. The true meaning therefore is, "we stumble (reel about) among fat ones, or those who lead a merry life," as if we were dead. "And what," as Doederlein observes, "can be imagined more gloomy and sad, than to be wandering about like shades, while others are fat and flourishing?" The growling and moaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-11.htm">Isaiah 59:11</a> are expressions of impatience and pain produced by longing. The people now fall into a state of impatience, and roar like bears (ha&#770;ma&#770;h like fremere), as when, for example, a bear scents a flock, and prowls about it (vespertinus circumgemit ursus ovile: Hor. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/16.htm">Ephesians 16</a>.51); and now again they give themselves up to melancholy, and moan in a low and mournful tone like the doves, quarum blanditias verbaque murmur habet (Ovid). &#1492;&#1490;&#1492;, like murmurare, expresses less depth of tone or raucitas than &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;. All their looking for righteousness and salvation turns out again and again to be nothing but self-deception, when the time for their coming seems close at hand. </body></html>
