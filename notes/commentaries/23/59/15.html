The words remind us of the terrible picture of Greek demoralisation in Thuc. iii.<p><span class= "bld">And the Lord saw it . . .</span>—The verse at first suggests the thought that what Jehovah saw were the sins thus described. The sequence of thought, however, tends to the conclusion that the words are properly the beginning of a new section, and that the supplied pronoun refers to the repentance and confession of the people. It displeased Him—literally, <span class= "ital">was evil in His eyes</span>—that the penitents were still subject to oppression, that they found no leader and deliverer, and therefore He came, as it were, alone and unaided, to the rescue.

The word used here (from &#1506;&#1491;&#1512;  &#8219;a&#770;dar) means "to be left, to remain" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-22.htm">2 Samuel 17:22</a>; then "to be missing or lacking" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-19.htm">1 Samuel 30:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>. Here it means that truth had no existence there.<p>And he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey - Margin, 'Is accounted mad.' Noyes renders this, 'And he that departeth from evil is plundered.' Grotius renders it, 'The innocent man lies open to injury from all.' The Septuagint, 'They took away the mind from understanding;' or, 'They substituted opinion in the place of knowledge.' (Thompson's Translation.) The phrase, 'He that departeth from evil,' means evidently a man who did not, and would not, fall in with the prevailing iniquitous practices, but who maintained a life of honesty and piety. It was one of the evils of the times that such a man would be harassed, plundered, ill-treated. The word rendered 'maketh himself a prey' (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;  misheto&#770;le&#772;l from &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500;  sha&#770;lal), is a word usually signifying to strip off, to plunder, to spoil. Some have supposed that the word means to make foolish, or to account mad, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/12-17.htm">Job 12:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-19.htm">Job 12:19</a>. Thus, in the passage before us, the Septuagint understood the word, and this sense of the word our translators have placed in the margin. But there is no reason for departing here from the usual signification of the word as denoting to plunder, to spoil; and the idea is, that the people of honesty and piety were subject to the rapacity of the avaricious, and the oppression of the mighty. They regarded them as lawful prey, and took every advantage in stripping them of their property, and reducing them to want. This completes the statement of the crimes of the nation, and the existence of such deeds of violence and iniquity constituted the basis on which God was led to interpose and effect deliverance. Such a state of crime and consequent suffering demanded the divine interposition; and when Yahweh saw it, he was led to provide a way for deliverance and reform.<p>The passage before us had a primary reference to the prevalence of iniquity in the Jewish nation. But it is language also that will quite as appropriately describe the moral condition of the world as laying the foundation for the necessity of the divine interposition by the Messiah. Indeed, the following verses undoubtedly refer to him. No one, it is believed, can attentively read the passage, and doubt this. The mind of the prophet is fixed upon the depravity of the Jewish nation. The hands, the tongue, the eyes, the feet, the fingers, were all polluted. The whole nation was sunk in moral corruption; and this was but a partial description of what was occurring everywhere on the earth. In such a state of things in the Jewish nation, and in the whole world, the question could not but arise, whether no deliverer could be found. Was there no way of pardon; no way by which deserved and impending wrath could be diverted? From this melancholy view, therefore, the prophet turns to him who was to be the Great Deliverer, and the remainder of the chapter is occupied with a most beautiful description of the Redeemer, and of the effect of his coming. The sentiment of the whole passage is, "that the deep and extended depravity of man was the foundation of the necessity of the divine interposition in securing salvation, and that in view of the guilt of people, God provided one who was a Glorious Deliverer, and who was to come to Zion as the Redeemer."<p>And the Lord saw it - He saw there was no righteousness; no light; no love; no truth. All was violence and oppression: all was darkness and gloom.<p>And it displeased him - Margin, 'Was evil in his eyes.' So Jerome, 'It appeared evil in his eyes.' Septuagint, &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b7;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;  Kai ouk e&#772;resen auto&#772; - 'And it did not please him.' The Hebrew, &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1506;  vaye&#772;ra&#8219; means, literally, 'It was evil in his eyes.' That is, it was painful or displeasing to him. The existence of so much sin and darkness was contrary to the benevolent feelings of his heart.<p>That there was no judgment - No righteousness; no equity; and that iniquity and oppression abounded. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/59.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. faileth&#8212;is not to be found.<p>he that departeth &#8230; prey&#8212;He that will not fall in with the prevailing iniquity exposes himself as a prey to the wicked (Ps 10:8, 9).<p>Lord saw it&#8212;The iniquity of Israel, so desperate as to require nothing short of Jehovah's interposition to mend it, typifies the same necessity for a Divine Mediator existing in the deep corruption of man; Israel, the model nation, was chosen to illustrate his awful fact.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/59.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Truth faileth:</span> q.d.

The logical development of the argument seems to be arrested by the conviction that the existing situation is hopeless, and only to be terminated through the personal intervention of Jehovah. This conviction clothes itself first of all in a prophetic vision of Jehovah as He appears to judgement; which is followed by an announcement of the consequences of His interposition for the two classes within Israel and for mankind at large. Although the transition in the middle of this verse is abrupt and unexpected there is no sufficient reason to doubt the unity of the discourse.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/59.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, truth faileth</span>. Truth itself is altogether gone, is missing, not forthcoming. "Tetras Astraea reliquit." This is the worst of all. For truth is the basis of the social fabric, the groundwork of all morality.

The deliverance will be followed by the establishment of Messiah's kingdom, which will continue for ever. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord saw it</span>. The division of the verses here requires alteration. The opening clause of ver. 15 belongs to what precedes; the second clause to what follows. "The Lord saw" that condition of things in Israel which is described in vers. 3-15; and it displeased him; literally, <span class="accented">it was evil in his eyes</span>, especially in that there was no judgment. Justice was not done between man and man; no one thought of pronouncing just judgments. The circumstances were such as to invite a Divine interposition. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/59.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the second strophe the prophet includes himself when speaking of the people. They now mourn over that state of exhaustion into which they have been brought through the perpetual straining and disappointment of expectation, and confess those sins on account of which the righteousness and salvation of Jehovah have been withheld. The prophet is speaking communicatively here; for even the better portion of the nation was involved in the guilt and consequences of the corruption which prevailed among the exiles, inasmuch as a nation forms an organized whole, and the delay of redemption really affected them. "Therefore right remains far from us, and righteousness does not overtake us; we hope for light, and behold darkness; for brightness - we walk in thick darkness. We grope along the wall like the blind, and like eyeless men we grope: we stumble in the light of noon-day as in the darkness, and among the living like the dead. We roar all like bears, and moan deeply like doves: we hope for right, and it cometh not; for salvation - it remaineth far off from us." At the end of this group of verses, again, the thought with which it sets out is palindromically repeated. The perfect &#1512;&#1495;&#1511;&#1492; denotes a state of things reaching from the past into the present; the future &#1514;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1497;&#1490;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; a state of things continuing unchangeable in the present. By mishpa&#770;t we understand a solution of existing inequalities or incongruities through the judicial interposition of God; by tseda&#770;qa&#770;h the manifestation of justice, which bestows upon Israel grace as its right in accordance with the plan of salvation after the long continuance of punishment, and pours out merited punishment upon the instruments employed in punishing Israel. The prophet's standpoint, whether a real or an ideal one, is the last decade of the captivity. At that time, about the period of the Lydian war, when Cyrus was making one prosperous stroke after another, and yet waited so long before he turned his arms against Babylon, it may easily be supposed that hope and despondency alternated incessantly in the minds of the exiles. The dark future, which the prophet penetrated in the light of the Spirit, was indeed broken up by rays of hope, but it did not amount to light, i.e., to a perfect lighting up (nego&#772;ho&#772;th, an intensified plural of nego&#772;ha&#770;h, like nekho&#772;cho&#772;th in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-10.htm">Isaiah 26:10</a>, pl. of nekho&#772;cha&#770;h in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-14.htm">Isaiah 59:14</a>); on the contrary, darkness was still the prevailing state, and in the deep thick darkness ('a&#774;phe&#772;lo&#772;th) the exiles pined away, without the promised release being effected for them by the oppressor of the nations. "We grope," they here complain, "like blind men by a wall, in which there is no opening, and like eyeless men we grope." &#1490;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473; (only used here) is a synonym of the older &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29</a>); &#1504;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; (with the elision of the reduplication, which it is hardly possible to render audible, and which comes up again in the pausal &#1504;&#1490;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;) has the a&#770;h of force, here of the impulse to self-preservation, which leads them to grope for an outlet in this &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;; and &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; is not quite synonymous with &#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, for there is such a thing as blindness with apparently sound eyes (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-8.htm">Isaiah 43:8</a>); and there is also a real absence of eyes, on account of either a natural malformation, or the actual loss of the eyes through either external injury or disease.<p>In the lamentation which follows, "we stumble in the light of noon-day (&#1510;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, meridies  equals  mesidies, the culminating point at which the eastern light is separated from the western) as if it were darkness, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, as if we were dead men," we may infer from the parallelism that since &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; must express some antithesis to &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, it cannot mean either in caliginosis (Jer., Luther, etc.), or "in the graves" (Targ., D. Kimchi, etc.), or "in desolate places" (J. Kimchi). Moreover, there is no such word in Hebrew as &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, to be dark, although the lexicographers give a Syriac word &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1502;&#1504;&#1488;, thick darkness (possibly related to Arab. &#8219;atamat, which does not mean the dark night, but late in the night); and the verb sha&#770;me&#772;n, to be fat, is never applied to "fat, i.e., thick darkness," as Knobel assumes, whilst the form of the word with &#1504; c. dagesh precludes the meaning a solitary place or desert (from &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501;). The form in question points rather to the verbal stem &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503;, which yields a fitting antithesis to &#1499;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, whether we explain it as meaning "in luxuriant fields," or "among the fat ones, i.e., those who glory in their abundant health." We prefer the latter, since the word mishmann&#305;&#772;m (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-24.htm">Daniel 11:24</a>; cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-28.htm">Genesis 27:28</a>) had already been coined to express the other idea; and as a rule, words formed with &#1488; prosth. point rather to an attributive than to a substantive idea. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; is a more emphatic form of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-29.htm">Judges 3:29</a>);<p>(Note: The name of the Phoenician god of health and prosperity, viz., Esmoun, which Alois Mller (Esmun, ein Beitrag zur Mythologie des orient. Alterthums. 1864) traces to &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-32.htm">Psalm 68:32</a>) from &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;  equals  &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, "the splendid one (illustris)," probably means "the healthy one, or one of full health" (after the form &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;), which agrees somewhat better with the account of Photios:  &#787;&#769;&#x395;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3a6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c9;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b7; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;.)<p>and &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; indicates indirectly the very same thing which is directly expressed by &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-16.htm">Isaiah 10:16</a>. Such explanations as "in opimis rebus" (Stier, etc.), or "in fatness of body, i.e., fulness of life" (Bttcher), are neither so suitable to the form of the word, nor do they answer to the circumstances referred to here, where all the people in exile are speaking. The true meaning therefore is, "we stumble (reel about) among fat ones, or those who lead a merry life," as if we were dead. "And what," as Doederlein observes, "can be imagined more gloomy and sad, than to be wandering about like shades, while others are fat and flourishing?" The growling and moaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-11.htm">Isaiah 59:11</a> are expressions of impatience and pain produced by longing. The people now fall into a state of impatience, and roar like bears (ha&#770;ma&#770;h like fremere), as when, for example, a bear scents a flock, and prowls about it (vespertinus circumgemit ursus ovile: Hor. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/16.htm">Ephesians 16</a>.51); and now again they give themselves up to melancholy, and moan in a low and mournful tone like the doves, quarum blanditias verbaque murmur habet (Ovid). &#1492;&#1490;&#1492;, like murmurare, expresses less depth of tone or raucitas than &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;. All their looking for righteousness and salvation turns out again and again to be nothing but self-deception, when the time for their coming seems close at hand. </body></html>
