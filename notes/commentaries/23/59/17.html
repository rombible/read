It is generally thought to describe the coming of the Messiah, as the Avenger and Deliverer of his church. There was none to intercede with God to turn away his wrath; none to interpose for the support of justice and truth. Yet He engaged his own strength and righteousness for his people. God will make his justice upon the enemies of his church and people plainly appear. When the enemy threatens to bear down all without control, then the Spirit of the Lord shall stop him, put him to flight. He that has delivered, will still deliver. A far more glorious salvation is promised to be wrought out by the Messiah in the fulness of time, which all the prophets had in view. The Son of God shall come to us to be our Redeemer; the Spirit of God shall come to be our Sanctifier: thus the Comforter shall abide with the church for ever, Joh 14:16. The word of Christ will always continue in the mouths of the faithful; and whatever is pretended to be the mind of the Spirit, must be tried by the Scriptures. We must lament the progress of infidelity and impiety. But the cause of the Redeemer shall gain a complete victory even on earth, and the believer will be more than conqueror when the Lord receives him to his glory in heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/59.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he put on righteousness - That is, God the Redeemer. The prophet here introduces him as going forth to vindicate his people clad like an ancient warrior. In the declaration that he 'put on righteousness,' the essential idea is, that he was pure and holy. The same image is used by the prophet in another figure in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-5.htm">Isaiah 11:5</a> (see the note at that place).<p>As a breastplate - The breastplate was a well-known piece of ancient armor, designed to defend the breast from the darts and the sword of an enemy. The design here is, to represent the Redeemer as a hero; and accordingly allusion is made to the various parts of the armor of a warrior. Yet he was not to be literally armed for battle. Instead of being an earthly conqueror, clad in steel, and defended with brass, his weapons were moral weapons, and his conquests were spiritual. The various parts of his weapons were 'righteousness.' 'salvation,' and 'zeal.' This statement should have been, in itself, sufficient to keep the Jews front anticipating a Messiah who would be a bloody warrior and distinguished for deeds of conquest and blood. This figure of speech is not uncommon. Paul (in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14-17</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-7.htm">2 Corinthians 6:7</a>) has carried it out to greater length, and introduced more particulars in the description of the spiritual armor of the Christian.<p>And an helmet of salvation - The helmet was a piece of defensive armor for the head. It was made of iron or brass, and usually surmounted by a crest of hair. It was designed to guard the head from the stroke of a sword. No particular stress should be laid on the fact, that it is said that 'salvation' would be the helmet. The design is to represent the Redeemer by the figure of a hero clad in armor, yet there seems to be no particular reason why salvation should be referred to as the helmet, or righteousness as the cuirass or breastplate. Nothing is gained by a fanciful attempt to spiritualize or explain them.<p>And he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing - By 'garments,' here, Vitringa supposes that there is reference to the interior garments which were worn by the Orientals corresponding to the tunic of the Romans. But it is more probable that the allusion is to the other parts of the dress or armor in general of the ancient warrior. The statement that he was clad in the garments of vengeance means, that he would go forth to vindicate his people, and to take vengeance on his foes. It would not be for mere defense that he would be thus armed for battle; but he would go forth for aggressive movements, in subduing his enemies and delivering his people (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-1.htm">Isaiah 63:1-6</a>).<p>And was clad with zeal as a cloak - The cloak worn by men in military as well as in civil life, was a loose flowing robe or mantle that was thrown over the body, usually fastened on the right shoulder by a hook or clasp, and suffered to flow in graceful folds down to the feet. In battle, it would be laid aside, or secured by a girdle about the loins. Vitringa remarks, that, as it was usually of purple color, it was adapted to represent the zeal which would burn for vengeance on an enemy. But the whole figure here is that drawn from a warrior or a conqueror: a hero prepared alike for defense and offence. The idea is, that he would be able to defend and vindicate his people, and to carry on aggressive warfare against his enemies. But it was not to be a warfare literally of blood and carnage. It was to be such as would be accomplished by righteousness, and zeal, and a desire to secure salvation. The triumph of righteousness was the great object still; the conquests of the Redeemer were to be those of truth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/59.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. Messiah is represented as a warrior armed at all points, going forth to vindicate His people. Owing to the unity of Christ and His people, their armor is like His, except that they have no "garments of vengeance" (which is God's prerogative, Ro 12:19), or "cloak of zeal" (in the sense of judicial fury punishing the wicked; this zeal belongs properly to God, 2Ki 10:16; Ro 10:2; Php 3:6; "zeal," in the sense of anxiety for the Lord's honor, they have, Nu 25:11, 13; Ps 69:9; 2Co 7:11; 9:2); and for "salvation," which is of God alone (Ps 3:8), they have as their helmet, "the hope of salvation" (1Th 5:8). The "helmet of salvation" is attributed to them (Eph 6:14, 17) in a secondary sense; namely, derived from Him, and as yet only in hope, not fruition (Ro 8:24). The second coming here, as often, is included in this representation of Messiah. His "zeal" (Joh 2:15-17) at His first coming was but a type of His zeal and vengeance against the foes of God at His second coming (2Th 1:8-10; Re 19:11-21).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/59.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He put on righteousness as a breastplate; </span> God, resolving to appear as a man of war against Babylon, that did now oppress his people, puts on his arms, Heb. <span class="ital">wrapped himself</span>, and particularly his <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">breastplate, </span> which he calls <span class="ital">righteousness</span>, to show the justness of his cause, as also his faithfulness in making good his promises to his people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">An helmet:</span> as the <span class="ital">breastplate</span> is to defend the heart and vital parts, whereby God doth signify the innocency and justness of his cause, as well as his faithfulness; so the <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">helmet</span> is to defend the brain, the fountain of the animal spirits, and therefore by this piece of armour would have us know that he is invincible: as by the other, that he defends a just cause in his truth and faithfulness; so by this, that he cannot be disappointed in it by reason of his power and invincibleness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The garments of vengeance, </span> or garments made of vengeance; as God is said to put on the former for their sakes whom he would preserve, so he puts on these for their sakes whom he will destroy, viz. his people’s enemies, the Chaldeans, and other enemies of the Jews. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Was clad with zeal; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

(cf. however, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-5.htm" title="And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.">Isaiah 11:5</a>).

The Isaiah anthropomorphism is far less gross than the Homeric. The gods in Homer put on actual armour, and take sword and shield. Jehovah arms himself for the battle in a way that is manifestly metaphoric. He puts on a "Divine panoply"  - righteousness as his breastplate, salvation as his helmet, vengeance for garments, and zeal, or jealousy, for a cloak. He takes no offensive weapons - "the out-breathing of his Spirit (ver. 19) is enough" (Kay). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/59.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the second strophe the prophet includes himself when speaking of the people. They now mourn over that state of exhaustion into which they have been brought through the perpetual straining and disappointment of expectation, and confess those sins on account of which the righteousness and salvation of Jehovah have been withheld. The prophet is speaking communicatively here; for even the better portion of the nation was involved in the guilt and consequences of the corruption which prevailed among the exiles, inasmuch as a nation forms an organized whole, and the delay of redemption really affected them. "Therefore right remains far from us, and righteousness does not overtake us; we hope for light, and behold darkness; for brightness - we walk in thick darkness. We grope along the wall like the blind, and like eyeless men we grope: we stumble in the light of noon-day as in the darkness, and among the living like the dead. We roar all like bears, and moan deeply like doves: we hope for right, and it cometh not; for salvation - it remaineth far off from us." At the end of this group of verses, again, the thought with which it sets out is palindromically repeated. The perfect &#1512;&#1495;&#1511;&#1492; denotes a state of things reaching from the past into the present; the future &#1514;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1497;&#1490;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; a state of things continuing unchangeable in the present. By mishpa&#770;t we understand a solution of existing inequalities or incongruities through the judicial interposition of God; by tseda&#770;qa&#770;h the manifestation of justice, which bestows upon Israel grace as its right in accordance with the plan of salvation after the long continuance of punishment, and pours out merited punishment upon the instruments employed in punishing Israel. The prophet's standpoint, whether a real or an ideal one, is the last decade of the captivity. At that time, about the period of the Lydian war, when Cyrus was making one prosperous stroke after another, and yet waited so long before he turned his arms against Babylon, it may easily be supposed that hope and despondency alternated incessantly in the minds of the exiles. The dark future, which the prophet penetrated in the light of the Spirit, was indeed broken up by rays of hope, but it did not amount to light, i.e., to a perfect lighting up (nego&#772;ho&#772;th, an intensified plural of nego&#772;ha&#770;h, like nekho&#772;cho&#772;th in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-10.htm">Isaiah 26:10</a>, pl. of nekho&#772;cha&#770;h in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-14.htm">Isaiah 59:14</a>); on the contrary, darkness was still the prevailing state, and in the deep thick darkness ('a&#774;phe&#772;lo&#772;th) the exiles pined away, without the promised release being effected for them by the oppressor of the nations. "We grope," they here complain, "like blind men by a wall, in which there is no opening, and like eyeless men we grope." &#1490;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473; (only used here) is a synonym of the older &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29</a>); &#1504;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; (with the elision of the reduplication, which it is hardly possible to render audible, and which comes up again in the pausal &#1504;&#1490;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;) has the a&#770;h of force, here of the impulse to self-preservation, which leads them to grope for an outlet in this &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;; and &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; is not quite synonymous with &#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, for there is such a thing as blindness with apparently sound eyes (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-8.htm">Isaiah 43:8</a>); and there is also a real absence of eyes, on account of either a natural malformation, or the actual loss of the eyes through either external injury or disease.<p>In the lamentation which follows, "we stumble in the light of noon-day (&#1510;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, meridies  equals  mesidies, the culminating point at which the eastern light is separated from the western) as if it were darkness, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, as if we were dead men," we may infer from the parallelism that since &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; must express some antithesis to &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, it cannot mean either in caliginosis (Jer., Luther, etc.), or "in the graves" (Targ., D. Kimchi, etc.), or "in desolate places" (J. Kimchi). Moreover, there is no such word in Hebrew as &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, to be dark, although the lexicographers give a Syriac word &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1502;&#1504;&#1488;, thick darkness (possibly related to Arab. &#8219;atamat, which does not mean the dark night, but late in the night); and the verb sha&#770;me&#772;n, to be fat, is never applied to "fat, i.e., thick darkness," as Knobel assumes, whilst the form of the word with &#1504; c. dagesh precludes the meaning a solitary place or desert (from &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501;). The form in question points rather to the verbal stem &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503;, which yields a fitting antithesis to &#1499;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, whether we explain it as meaning "in luxuriant fields," or "among the fat ones, i.e., those who glory in their abundant health." We prefer the latter, since the word mishmann&#305;&#772;m (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-24.htm">Daniel 11:24</a>; cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-28.htm">Genesis 27:28</a>) had already been coined to express the other idea; and as a rule, words formed with &#1488; prosth. point rather to an attributive than to a substantive idea. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; is a more emphatic form of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-29.htm">Judges 3:29</a>);<p>(Note: The name of the Phoenician god of health and prosperity, viz., Esmoun, which Alois Mller (Esmun, ein Beitrag zur Mythologie des orient.

Such explanations as "in opimis rebus" (Stier, etc.), or "in fatness of body, i.e., fulness of life" (Bttcher), are neither so suitable to the form of the word, nor do they answer to the circumstances referred to here, where all the people in exile are speaking. The true meaning therefore is, "we stumble (reel about) among fat ones, or those who lead a merry life," as if we were dead. "And what," as Doederlein observes, "can be imagined more gloomy and sad, than to be wandering about like shades, while others are fat and flourishing?" The growling and moaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-11.htm">Isaiah 59:11</a> are expressions of impatience and pain produced by longing. The people now fall into a state of impatience, and roar like bears (ha&#770;ma&#770;h like fremere), as when, for example, a bear scents a flock, and prowls about it (vespertinus circumgemit ursus ovile: Hor. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/16.htm">Ephesians 16</a>.51); and now again they give themselves up to melancholy, and moan in a low and mournful tone like the doves, quarum blanditias verbaque murmur habet (Ovid). &#1492;&#1490;&#1492;, like murmurare, expresses less depth of tone or raucitas than &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;. All their looking for righteousness and salvation turns out again and again to be nothing but self-deception, when the time for their coming seems close at hand. </body></html>
