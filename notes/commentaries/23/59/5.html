See here sin in true colours, exceedingly sinful; and see sin in its consequences, exceedingly hurtful, separating from God, and so separating us, not only from all good, but to all evil. Yet numbers feed, to their own destruction, on infidel and wicked systems. Nor can their skill or craft, in devising schemes, as the spider weaves its web, deliver or save them.

On the meaning of the word rendered here 'cockatrice,' see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-8.htm">Isaiah 11:8</a>. Some poisonous serpent is intended, probably the adder, or the serpent known among the Greeks as the basilisk, or cerastes. This figurative expression is designed to show the evil nature and tendency of their works. They were as if they should carefully nourish the eggs of a venomous serpent. Instead of crushing them with the foot and destroying them, they took pains to hatch them, and produce a venomous race of reptiles. Nothing can more forcibly describe the wicked character and plans of sinners than the language used here - plans that are as pernicious, loathsome, and hateful as the poisonous serpents that spread death and ruin and alarm everywhere.<p>And weave the spider's web - This phrase, in itself, may denote, as some have understood it, that they formed plans designed to seize upon and destroy others, as spiders weave their web for the purpose of catching and destroying insects. But the following verse shows that the language is used rather with reference to the tenuity and gossamer character of the web, than with any such designs. Their works were like the web of the spider. They bore the same relation to true piety which the web of the spider did to substantial and comfortable raiment. They were vain and useless. The word rendered here 'web' properly denotes the cross-threads in weaving, the woof or filling; and is probably derived from a word signify ing a cross-beam (see Rosenmuller in loc; also Bochart, Hieroz. ii. 4. 23).<p>He that eateth of their eggs dieth - That is, he who partakes of their counsels, or of the plans which they form, shall perish. Calvin says that the meaning is, that 'whosoever had anything to do with them would find them destructive and pestiferous.' Similar phrases, comparing the plans of the wicked with the eggs and the brood of the serpent, are common in the East. 'It is said,' says Roberts, speaking of India, 'of the plans of a decidedly wicked and talented man, "That wretch! he hatches serpents' eggs." "Beware of the fellow, his eggs are nearly hatched." "Ah, my friend, touch not that affair, meddle not with that matter; there is a serpent in the shell."'<p>And that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper - On the meaning of the word rendered here 'viper,' see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>. Margin, 'Sprinkled, is as if there brake out a viper. Jerome renders it, 'Which if pierced, breaks out into a basilisk.' The Septuagint renders it, 'And he who was about to eat of their eggs having broken one that was putrid (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  suntripsas ourion), found in it a basilisk (&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  basiliskon). 'The difference of translation in the text and the margin of the common version has arisen from the fact that the translators supposed that the word used here (&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;  zu&#770;ra&#770;h) might be derived from &#1494;&#1512;&#1492;  za&#770;ra&#770;h, to sprinkle, or to scatter. But it is formed from the word &#1494;&#1493;&#1512;  zu&#770;r, to squeeze, to press, to crush; and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/39-15.htm">Job 39:15</a>, is applied to the fact that the ostrich might crush her eggs with her foot. The sense here is, that when their plans were developed, they would be found to be evil and pernacious - as when an egg should be broken open, a venomous setpent would come forth. The viper, it is true, brings forth its young alive, or is a viviparous animal. But Bochart has remarked, that though it produces its young in this manner, yet that during the period of gestation the young are included in eggs which are broken at the birth. This is a very impressive illustration of the character and plans of the wicked. The serpents here referred to are among the most venomous and destructive that are known. And the comparison here includes two points - <p>1. That their plans resembled the egg of the serpent. The nature of the egg cannot be easily known by an inspection. It may have a strong resemblance to those which would produce some inoffensive and even useful animals. It is only when it is hatched that its true nature is fully developed. So it is with the plans of the wicked. When forming, their true nature may not be certainly known, and it may not be easy to determine their real character.<p>2. Their plans, when developed, are like the poisonous and destructive production of the serpent's egg. The true nature is then seen; and it is ruinous, pernicious, and evil. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/59.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. cockatrice&#8212;probably the basilisk serpent, cerastes. Instead of crushing evil in the egg, they foster it.<p>spider's web&#8212;This refers not to the spider's web being made to entrap, but to its thinness, as contrasted with substantial "garments," as Isa 59:6 shows. Their works are vain and transitory (Job 8:14; Pr 11:18).<p>eateth &#8230; their eggs&#8212;he who partakes in their plans, or has anything to do with them, finds them pestiferous.<p>that which is crushed&#8212;The egg, when it is broken, breaketh out as a viper; their plans, however specious in their undeveloped form like the egg, when developed, are found pernicious. Though the viper is viviparous (from which "vi-per" is derived), yet during gestation, the young are included in eggs, which break at the birth [Bochart]; however, metaphors often combine things without representing everything to the life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/59.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They hatch cockatrice eggs; </span> or <span class="ital">adder</span>, or <span class="ital">basilisk</span>; one kind put for any venomous creature; a proverbial speech, signifying by these eggs mischievous designs, and by <span class="ital">hatching</span> them their putting them in practice: this is to show that mischief is natural to them, and they can do no otherwise, poison is natural to these eggs. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Weave the spider’s web; </span> another proverbial speech, whereby is taught, both how by their plots they weave nets, lay snares industriously, with great pains and artifice, whereby they may entangle and involve their poor neighbours in intricacies and perplexities, and so devour them, as the spider weaves her web to catch flies, and then to feed on them; and also how that they contrive nothing but what will tend to their own ruin, as the issue of the viper is the death of the mother, and they and their designs will come to nothing, and not answer their end, as the spider’s web is soon swept away, and is seen no more, which doth well agree with what follows. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He that eateth of their eggs dieth:</span> here is a catachrestical allusion, noting that he who hath commerce with them, and approves their counsels, which are the eggs which they hatch, will be poisoned with them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper:</span> if <span class="ital">and</span> be <span class="ital">copulative</span> here, then the sense is either, If any seek to crush and disappoint their plots, or if they be sprinkled or dispersed abroad, (as the margin seems to favour,) they will seek his ruin, will be as a viper to him.

Invent false doctrines according to their own fancies, which may seem fair and plausible, but are poisonous and pernicious; as the "eggs of the cockatrice", which may look like, and may be taken for, the eggs of creatures fit to eat; and spin out of their brains a fine scheme of things, but which are as thin, and as useless, and unprofitable, as "the spider's web"; and serve only to ensnare and entangle the minds of men, and will not stand before the word of God which sweeps them away at once; particularly of this kind is the doctrine of justification by the works of men, which are like the spider's web, spun out of its own bowels; so these are from themselves, as the doctrine of them is a device of man, and is not of God: <p>he that eateth of their eggs dieth: as a man that eats of cockatrice eggs dies immediately, being rank poison; so he that approves of false doctrines, receives them, and feeds upon them, dies spiritually and eternally; these are damnable doctrines, which bring upon men swift destruction; they are poisonous, and eat as do a canker, and destroy the souls of men: <p>and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper; or "cockatrice"; so Kimchi and Ben Melech take it to be the same creature as before, which goes by different names; and the words seem to require this sense; however, it cannot be the creature we call the viper, since that is not oviparous, but viviparous, lays not eggs, but brings forth its young; though both Aristotle (w) and Pliny (x), at the same time they say it is viviparous, yet observe that it breeds eggs within itself, which are of one colour, and soft like fishes. The Targum renders it "flying serpents": the sense is, that if a man is cautious, and does not eat of the cockatrice eggs, but sets his foot on them, and crushes them, out comes the venomous creature, and he is in danger of being hurt by it; so a man that does not embrace false doctrines, and escapes eternal death by them, but tramples upon them, opposes them, and endeavours to crush and destroy them, yet he is exposed to and brings upon himself calumnies, reproach, and persecution. <p>(w) Hist.

"If thou hold back thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy business on my holy day, and callest the Sabbath a delight, the holy of Jehovah, reverer, and honourest it, not doing thine own ways, not pursuing thy business and speaking words: then wilt thou have delight in Jehovah, and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the land, and make thee enjoy the inheritance of Jacob thy forefather, for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it." The duty of keeping the Sabbath is also enforced by Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-19.htm">Jeremiah 17:19</a>.) and Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-12.htm">Ezekiel 20:12</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-8.htm">Ezekiel 22:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-26.htm">Ezekiel 22:26</a>), and the neglect of this duty severely condemned. Chapter 56 has already shown the importance attached to it by our prophet. The Sabbath, above all other institutions appointed by the law, was the true means of uniting and sustaining Israel as a religious community, more especially in exile, where a great part of the worship necessarily feel into abeyance on account of its intimate connection with Jerusalem and the holy land; but whilst it was a Mosaic institution so far as its legal appointments were concerned, it rested, in a way which reached even beyond the rite of circumcision, upon a basis much older than that of the law, being a ceremonial copy of the Sabbath of creation, which was the divine rest established by God as the true object of all motion; for God entered into Himself again after He had created the world out of Himself, that all created things might enter into Him. In order that this, the great end set before all creation, and especially before mankind, viz., entrance into the rest of God, might be secured, the keeping of the Sabbath prescribed by the law was a divine method of education, which put an end every week to the ordinary avocations of the people, with their secular influence and their tendency to fix the mind on outward things, and was designed by the strict prohibition of all work to force them to enter into themselves and occupy their minds with God and His word. The prophet does not hedge round this commandment to keep the Sabbath with any new precepts, but merely demands for its observance full truth answering to the spirit of the letter. "If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath" is equivalent to, if thou do not tread upon its holy ground with a foot occupied with its everyday work. <p>&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; which follows is not elliptical ( equals  &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; answering to &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;, an unnecessary and mistaken assumption), but an explanatory permutative of the object "thy foot:" "turn away thy foot," viz., from attending to thy business (a defective plural) on my holy day. Again, if thou call (i.e., from inward contemplation and esteem) the Sabbath a pleasure (&#8219;o&#772;neg, because it leads thee to God, and not a burden because it leads thee away from thine everyday life; cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>) and the holy one of Jehovah (on this masculine personification of the Sabbath, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-2.htm">Isaiah 56:2</a>), "mekhubba&#770;d," honoured  equals  honourable, honorandus, and if thou truly honourest him, whom Jehovah has invested with the splendour of His own glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a> : "and sanctified it"), "not" (&#1502;&#1503;  equals  &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768;) "to perform thy ways" (the ordinary ways which relate to self-preservation, not to God), "not to attend to thine own business' (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-3.htm">Isaiah 58:3</a>) "and make words," viz., words of vain useless character and needless multitude (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/10-4.htm">Hosea 10:4</a>, denoting unspiritual gossip and boasting);<p>(Note: Hitzig observes, that "the law of the Sabbath has already received the Jewish addition, 'speaking is work.' " But from the premiss that the sabbatical rest of God was rest from speaking His creating word (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a>), all the conclusion that tradition has ever drawn is, that on the Sabbath men must to a certain extent rest &#1502;&#1492;&#1491;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; as well as &#1502;&#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;; and when R. Simon b. Jochai exclaimed to his loquacious old mother on the Sabbath, "Keeping the Sabbath means keeping silence," his meaning was not that talking in itself was working and therefore all conversation was forbidden on the Sabbath. Tradition never went as far as this. The rabbinical exposition of the passage before us is the following: "Let not thy talking on the Sabbath be the same as that on working days;" and when it is stated once in the Jerusalem Talmud that the Rabbins could hardly bring themselves to allow of friendly greetings on the Sabbath, it certainly follows from this, that they did not forbid them. Even the author of the &#1513; &#1500;&#1492; (&#1492;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1500;&#1493;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1497;) with its excessive ceremonial stringency goes no further than this, that on the Sabbath men must abstain from &#1495;&#1493;&#1500; &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;. And is it possible that our prophet can have been more stringent than the strictest traditionalists, and wished to make the keeper of the Sabbath a Carthusian monk? There could not be a more thorough perversion of the spirit of prophecy than this.)<p>then, just as the Sabbath is thy pleasure, so wilt thou have thy pleasure in Jehovah, i.e., enjoy His delightful fellowship (&#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492; &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1490;, a promise as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-26.htm">Job 22:26</a>), and He will reward thee for thy renunciation of earthly advantages with a victorious reign, with an unapproachable possession of the high places of the land - i.e., chiefly, though not exclusively, of the promised land, which shall then be restored to thee - and with the free and undisputed usufruct of the inheritance promised to thy forefather Jacob (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/105-10.htm">Psalm 105:10-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a>) - this will be thy glorious reward, for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it. Thus does Isaiah confirm the predictions of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-20.htm">Isaiah 1:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-25.htm">Isaiah 40:25</a> (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-3.htm">Isaiah 24:3</a>). </body></html>
