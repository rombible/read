The word rendered here 'roar' (from &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;  ha&#770;ma&#770;h, like English, to hum, German, hummen, spoken of bees), is applied to any murmuring, or confused noise or sound. It sometimes means to snarl, as a dog <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/59-7.htm">Psalm 59:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-15.htm">Psalm 59:15</a>; to coo, as a dove <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-16.htm">Ezekiel 7:16</a>; it is also applied to waves that roar <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-4.htm">Psalm 46:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-15.htm">Isaiah 51:15</a>; to a crowd or tumultuous assemblage <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7</a>; and to music <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-36.htm">Jeremiah 48:36</a>. Here it is applied to the low growl or groan of a bear. Bochart (Hieroz. i. 3. 9), says, that a bear produces a melancholy sound; and Horace (Epod. xvi. 51), speaks of its low groan:<p>Nee vespertinus circumgemit ursus ovile.<p>Here it is emblematic of mourning, and is designed to denote that they were suffering under heavy and long-continued calamity. Or, according to Gesenius (Commentary in loc.), it refers to a bear which is hungry, and which growls, impatient for food, and refers here to the complaining, dissatisfaction, and murmuring of the people, because God did not come to vindicate and relieve them.<p>And mourn sore like doves - The cooing of the dove, a plaintive sound, is often used to denote grief (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-16.htm">Ezekiel 7:16</a>; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>).<p>We look for judgment ... - (See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-9.htm">Isaiah 59:9</a>.) <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/59.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. roar&#8212;moan plaintively, like a hungry bear which growls for food.<p>doves&#8212;(Isa 38:14; Eze 7:16).<p>salvation&#8212;retribution in kind: because not salvation, but "destruction" was "in their paths" (Isa 59:7).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/59.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">We roar:</span> this signifies the greatness of their anguish, that forced from them these loud outcries. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And mourn:</span> this notes some sense of their condition, that wrought in them these sorrowful lamentations; or it may relate to the condition that both sorts of people were in under their oppressing governors.

Some in a more noisy and clamorous, others in a stiller way, yet all in private: for the bear, when robbed of its whelps, goes to its den and roars; and the dove, when it has lost its mate, mourns in solitude: this expresses the secret groanings of the saints under a sense of sin, and the forlorn state of religion. The Targum paraphrases it thus, <p>"we roar because of our enemies, who are gathered against us as bears; all of us indeed mourn sore as doves:'' <p>we look for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far from us; we expect that God will take vengeance on our enemies, and save us; look for judgment on antichrist, and the antichristian states, and for the salvation of the church of God; for the vials of divine wrath on the one, and for happy times to the other; but neither of them as yet come; the reason of which is as follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/59.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">We all roar like <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> bears, and mourn bitterly like doves: we look for judgment, but <i>there is</i> none; for salvation, <i>but</i> it is far from us.</span><p>(i) We express our sorrows by outward signs, some more and some less.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/59.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">We roar</span> (better <span class="bld">groan</span>) <span class="ital">all like bears</span>] Comp.

Here it represents the deep murmur of discontent, which alternates with the mournful tones of Israel's despondency - the latter being compared to the melancholy cooing of the dove (see ch. 38:14).

Lying and oppression universally prevail. "No one speaks with justice, and no one pleads with faithfulness; men trust in vanity, and speak with deception; they conceive trouble, and bring forth ruin. They hatch basilisks' eggs, and weave spiders' webs. He that eateth of their eggs must die; and if one is trodden upon, it splits into an adder. Their webs do not suffice for clothing, and men cannot cover themselves with their works: their works are works of ruin, and the practice of injustice is in their hands." As &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; is generally used in these prophetic addresses in the sense of &#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, and the judicial meaning, citare, in just vocare, litem intendere, cannot be sustained, we must adopt this explanation, "no one gives public evidence with justice" (lxx &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;). &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; is firm adherence to the rule of right and truth; &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; a conscientious reliance which awakens trust; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; (in a reciprocal sense, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-26.htm">Isaiah 43:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-16.htm">Isaiah 66:16</a>) signifies the commencement and pursuit of a law-suit with any one. The abstract infinitives which follow in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-4.htm">Isaiah 59:4</a> express the general characteristics of the social life of that time, after the manner of the historical infinitive in Latin (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-5.htm">Isaiah 21:5</a>; Ges. 131, 4, b). Men trust in to&#772;hu&#772;, that which is perfectly destitute of truth, and speak &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;, what is morally corrupt and worthless. The double figure &#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491; &#1506;&#1502;&#1500; &#1492;&#1512;&#1493; is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-35.htm">Job 15:35</a> (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15</a>). &#1492;&#1512;&#1493; (compare the poel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-13.htm">Isaiah 59:13</a>) is only another form for &#1492;&#1512;&#1492; (Ges. 131, 4, b); and &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491; (the western or Palestinian reading here), or &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491; (the oriental or Babylonian reading), is the usual form of the inf. abs. hiph. (Ges. 53, Anm. 2). What they carry about with them and set in operation is compared in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-5.htm">Isaiah 59:5</a> to basilisks' eggs (&#1510;&#1508;&#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;, serpens regulus, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-8.htm">Isaiah 11:8</a>) and spiders' webs (&#1506;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/8-14.htm">Job 8:14</a>, from &#1506;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;, possibly in the sense of squatter, sitter still, with the substantive ending &#305;&#772;sh). They hatch basilisks' eggs (&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1506; like &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-15.htm">Isaiah 34:15</a>, a perfect, denoting that which has hitherto always taken place and therefore is a customary thing); and they spin spiders' webs (&#1488;&#1512;&#1490; possibly related to &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7;-&#x3bd;&#x3b7;;<p>(Note: Neither &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; nor &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; has hitherto been traced to an Indian root in any admissible way. Benfey deduces the former from the root dhvir (to twist); but this root has to perform an immense number of services. M. Mller deduces the latter from rak; but this means to make, not to spin.)<p>the future denoting that which goes on occurring). The point of comparison in the first figure is the injurious nature of all they do, whether men rely upon it, in which case "he that eateth of their eggs dieth," or whether they are bold or imprudent enough to try and frustrate their plans and performances, when that (the egg) which is crushed or trodden upon splits into an adder, i.e., sends out an adder, which snaps at the heel of the disturber of its rest. &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/39-15.htm">Job 39:15</a>, here the part. pass. fem. like &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-21.htm">Isaiah 49:21</a>), with a - instead of a&#772; - like &#1500;&#1504;&#1492;, the original a&#774; of the feminine (zu&#772;ra&#774;th) having returned from its lengthening into a&#772; to the weaker lengthening into e&#774;. The point of comparison in the second figure is the worthlessness and deceptive character of their works. What they spin and make does not serve for a covering to any man (&#1497;&#1514;&#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; with the most general subject: Ges. 137, 3), but has simply the appearance of usefulness; their works are &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; (with metheg, not munach, under the Mem), evil works, and their acts are all directed to the injury of their neighbour, in his right and his possession. </body></html>
