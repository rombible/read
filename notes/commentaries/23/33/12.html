The righteous God often pays sinners in their own coin. Those who by faith humbly wait for God, shall find him gracious to them; as the day, so let the strength be. If God leaves us to ourselves any morning, we are undone; we must every morning commit ourselves to him, and go forth in his strength to do the work of the day. When God arises, his enemies are scattered. True wisdom and knowledge lead to strength of salvation, which renders us stedfast in the ways of God; and true piety is the only treasure which can never be plundered or spent. The distress Jerusalem was brought into, is described. God's time to appear for his people, is, when all other helpers fail. Let all who hear what God has done, acknowledge that he can do every thing. Sinners in Zion will have much to answer for, above other sinners. And those that rebel against the commands of the word, cannot take its comforts in time of need. His wrath will burn those everlastingly who make themselves fuel for it. It is a fire that shall never be quenched, nor ever go out of itself; it is the wrath of an ever-living God preying on the conscience of a never-dying soul.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the people - In the army of Sennacherib.<p>As the burnings of lime - As if placed in a burning lime-kiln, where they must certainly be destroyed (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-33.htm">Isaiah 30:33</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-1.htm">Amos 2:1</a>).<p>As thorns cut up - As thorns, or small brushwood, that has been long cut up and perfectly dried are speedily consumed, so shall it be with the Assyrian army.

Like chalk stones that are burnt to make lime of; which may denote not only their hardness and impenitency, which brought upon them and issued in the wrath of God; but the miserable condition into which they are brought, and the torture they should be put to: perhaps this may refer to the casting of the beast and false prophet alive into the lake burning with fire and brimstone, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a>, <p>as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire; "thorns" are a fit simile to express the unfruitfulness, uselessness, and harmfulness of wicked men, particularly the sons of Belial, the followers of antichrist; and these "cut up", and so not green and moist, but dry, and fit fuel for the fire, which burn the more easily and quickly, makes the metaphor more agreeable.

And there will be security of thy times, riches of salvation, of wisdom, and knowledge. Fear of Jehovah is then the treasure of Judah." Exalted: for though highly exalted in Himself, He has performed an act of justice and righteousness, with the sight and remembrance of which Zion is filled as with an overflowing rich supply of instruction and praise. A new time has dawned for the people of Judah. The prophet addresses them in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-6.htm">Isaiah 33:6</a>; for there is nothing to warrant us in regarding the words as addressed to Hezekiah. To the times succeeding this great achievement there would belong 'emu&#772;na&#770;h, i.e., (durability (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-12.htm">Exodus 17:12</a>) - a uniform and therefore trustworthy state of things (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-8.htm">Isaiah 39:8</a>, "peace and truth"). Secondly, there would also belong to them &#1495;&#1505;&#1503;, a rich store of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge (compare the verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-18.htm">Isaiah 23:18</a>). We regard these three ideas as all connected with cho&#772;sen. The prophet makes a certain advance towards the unfolding of the seven gifts in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, which are implied in "salvation;" but he hurries at once to the lowest of them, which forms the groundwork of all the rest, when he says, thirdly, that the fear of Jehovah will be the people's treasure. The construct form, chokhmath, instead of chokhma&#770;h, is a favourite one, which Isaiah employs, even apart from the genitive relation of the words, for the purpose of securing a closer connection, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-2.htm">Isaiah 35:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-21.htm">Isaiah 51:21</a> (compare pa&#770;rash in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-10.htm">Ezekiel 26:10</a>), clearly show. In the case before us, it has the further advantage of consonance in the closing sound. </body></html>
