The righteous God often pays sinners in their own coin. Those who by faith humbly wait for God, shall find him gracious to them; as the day, so let the strength be. If God leaves us to ourselves any morning, we are undone; we must every morning commit ourselves to him, and go forth in his strength to do the work of the day. When God arises, his enemies are scattered. True wisdom and knowledge lead to strength of salvation, which renders us stedfast in the ways of God; and true piety is the only treasure which can never be plundered or spent. The distress Jerusalem was brought into, is described. God's time to appear for his people, is, when all other helpers fail. Let all who hear what God has done, acknowledge that he can do every thing. Sinners in Zion will have much to answer for, above other sinners. And those that rebel against the commands of the word, cannot take its comforts in time of need. His wrath will burn those everlastingly who make themselves fuel for it. It is a fire that shall never be quenched, nor ever go out of itself; it is the wrath of an ever-living God preying on the conscience of a never-dying soul.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The earth mourneth - The land through which he has passed. For the sense of this phrase, see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-4.htm">Isaiah 24:4</a>.<p>Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down - For the situation of Lebanon, see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-34.htm">Isaiah 10:34</a>. Lebanon was distinguished for its ornaments of beautiful cedars. Here iris represented as being stript of these ornaments, and as covered with shame on that account. There is not any direct historical evidence that Sennacherib had advanced to Lebanon, though there are some intimations that this had occurred (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-8.htm">Isaiah 14:8</a>), and it was certainly a part of his boast that he had done it (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>). There is no improbability in supposing that he had sent a part of his army to plunder the country in the vicinity of Lebanon (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-1.htm">Isaiah 20:1</a>).<p>Sharon is like a wilderness - Sharon was the name of a district south of mount Carmel along the coast of the Mediterranean, extending to Cesarea and Joppa. The name was almost proverbial to express any place of extraordinary beauty and fertility (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-16.htm">1 Chronicles 5:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-29.htm">1 Chronicles 27:29</a>; Sol 2:1; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-2.htm">Isaiah 35:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-10.htm">Isaiah 65:10</a>). There was also another Sharon on the east side of the Jordan, and in the vicinity of Bashan, which was also a fertile region <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-16.htm">1 Chronicles 5:16</a>. To this, it is more probable that the prophet here refers, though it is not certain. The object seems to be to mention the most fertile places in the land as being now desolate.<p>Bashan - For an account of the situation of Bashan, subsequently called Batanea, see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-13.htm">Isaiah 2:13</a>.<p>And Carmel - (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-17.htm">Isaiah 29:17</a>).<p>Shake off their fruits - The words 'their fruits,' are not in the Hebrew. The Septuagint reads this: 'Galilee and Carmel are made bare' (&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, &#x3ba;.&#x3c4;.&#x3bb;.  phanera estai, etc.) The Hebrew word &#1504;&#1506;&#1512;  no&#8219;e&#772;r probably means to shake; to shake out or off; and refers here to the fact probably that Bashan and Carmel are represented as having shaken off their leaves, and were now lying desolate as in winter. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

It is the language of poetry. The “earth” is neither the whole world, nor merely the land of Palestine; its equivalent in modern parlance might be “Nature.” The spots mentioned are those famous for their luxuriant vegetation, and the standing types of natural beauty and perennial verdure (cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-2.htm" title="It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the LORD, and the excellency of our God.">Isaiah 35:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-2.htm" title="Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O you oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down.">Zechariah 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-4.htm" title="Your neck is as a tower of ivory; your eyes like the fish pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: your nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.">Song of Solomon 7:4</a> f.).

Lebanon, Sharon, Carmel, and Bashan are the four most beautiful regions of the Holy Land, taking the word in its widest extent. Lebanon is the northern mountain-range, one hundred and twenty miles in length, clad with cedars and firs, and generally crowned with snow, whence the name (from <span class="accented">laban</span>, white). Sharon is "the broad rich tract of land" which stretches southwards from the foot of Carmel, and melts into the Shefelah, noted for its flowers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-1.htm">Song of Solomon 2:1</a>) and forests (Josephus, '<span class="accented">Ant</span>. Jud.,' 14:13, &sect; 3). Carmel is the upland dividing Sharon from the Esdraelon plain, famous for its "<span class="accented">rocky</span> dells" and "deep jungles of copse." Finally, Bashan is the trans-Jordanic upland, stretching from the flanks of Hermon to Gilead, celebrated for its "high downs" and "wide-sweeping plains," for its "forests of oak," and in ancient times for its herds of wild cattle. All are said to be "waste," "withered," and the like, partly on account of the Assyrian ravages, but perhaps still more as sympathizing with the Jewish nation in their distress - "ashamed" for them, and clad in mourning on their account. <span class="cmt_word">Shake off their fruits;</span> rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">shake down their leaves</span>. Mr. Cheyne conjectures that the prophecy was delivered in autumn. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>While the prophet is praying thus, he already sees the answer. "At the sound of a noise peoples pass away; at Thy rising nations are scattered. And your booty is swept away as a swarm of locusts sweeps away; as beetles run, they run upon it." The indeterminate ha&#770;mo&#772;n, which produces for that very reason the impression of something mysterious and terrible, is at once explained. The noise comes from Jehovah, who is raising Himself judicially above Assyria, and thunders as a judge. Then the hostile army runs away (&#1504;&#1508;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;  equals  &#1504;&#1508;&#1510;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, from the niphal &#1504;&#1508;&#1509;,   <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-11.htm">1 Samuel 13:11</a>, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1509;  equals  &#1504;&#1508;&#1493;&#1509;, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;); and your booty (the address returns to Assyria) is swept away, just as when a swarm of locusts settles on a field, it soon eats it utterly away. Jerome, Cappellus, and others follow the Septuagint rendering, &#x3bf;&#788;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b7; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;. The figure is quite as appropriate, but the article in hecha&#770;s&#305;&#772;l makes the other view the more natural one; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-4.htm">Isaiah 33:4</a> places this beyond all doubt. Sha&#770;qaq, from which the participle sho&#772;qe&#772;q and the substantive massha&#770;q are derived, is sued here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-9.htm">Joel 2:9</a>, to signify a busy running hither and thither (discursitare). The syntactic use of sho&#772;qe&#772;q is the same as that of &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; (they call) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-11.htm">Isaiah 21:11</a>, and so&#772;phed&#305;&#772;m (they smite) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-12.htm">Isaiah 32:12</a>. The inhabitants of Jerusalem swarm in the enemy's camp like beetles; they are all in motion, and carry off what they can. </body></html>
