The man who is true and just in all his dealings can dwell in closest fellowship with that holiness which is to others as a consuming fire. To him it is a protection and defence, a “rock fortress,” in which he can dwell securely, where he will find all that he needs for the sustenance of soul and body, the bread and the water of life.

The Divine power will keep him safe, and his faith in that power will keep him easy. He shall want nothing needful for him. Every blessing of salvation is freely bestowed on all that ask with humble, believing prayer; and the believer is safe in time and for ever. Those that walk uprightly shall not only have bread given, and their water sure, but they shall, by faith, see the King of kings in his beauty, the beauty of holiness. The remembrance of the terror they were in, shall add to the pleasure of their deliverance. It is desirable to be quiet in our own houses, but much more so to be quiet in God's house; and in every age Christ will have a seed to serve him. Jerusalem had no large river running by it, but the presence and power of God make up all wants. We have all in God, all we need, or can desire. By faith we take Christ for our Prince and Saviour; he reigns over his redeemed people. All that refuse to have Him to reign over them, make shipwreck of their souls. Sickness is taken away in mercy, when the fruit of it is the taking away of sin. If iniquity be taken away, we have little reason to complain of outward affliction. This last verse leads our thoughts, not only to the most glorious state of the gospel church on earth, but to heaven, where no sickness or trouble can enter. He that blotteth out our transgressions, will heal our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that walketh righteously - In this and the following verses the prophet presents, in contrast, the confidence and the security of the righteous. He first, in this verse, describes the characteristics of the righteous, and in the following verses their confidence in God, and their security and safety. The first characteristic of the righteous man is that he walks righteously; that is, he lives righteously; he does right.<p>And speaketh uprightly - The second characteristic - his words are well-ordered. lie is not false, perfidious, slanderous, or obscene in his words. If a private individual, his words are simple, honest, and true; if a magistrate, his decisions are according to justice.<p>He that despiseth the gain of oppressions - Margin, 'Deceits'. The third characteristic - he abhors the gain that is the result of imposition, false dealing, and false weights. Or if it mean oppressions, as the word usually does, then the sense is, that he does not oppress the poor, or take advantage of their needy condition, or affix exorbitant prices, or extort payment in a manner that is harsh and cruel.<p>That shaketh his hands from holding of bribes - The fourth characteristic - this relates particularly to magistrates. They adjudge causes according to justice, and do not allow their judgment to be swayed by the prospect of reward.<p>That stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood - This is the fifth characteristic. It means, evidently, he who does not listen to a proposal to shed blood, or to any scheme of violence, and robbery, and murder (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>).<p>And shutteth his eyes from seeing evil - He does not desire to see it; he is not found in the places where it is committed. A righteous man should not only have no part in evil, but he will keep himself if possible from being a witness of it. A man who sees all the evil that is going forward; that is present in every brawl and contention, is usually a man who has a fondness for such scenes, and who may be expected to take part in them. It is a remarkable fact that very few of the Society of Friends are ever seen in courts of justice as witnesses. The reason is, that they have no fondness for seeing the strifes and contentions of people, and are not found in those places where evil is usually committed. This is the sixth characteristic of the righteous man; and the sum of the whole is, that he keeps himself from all forms of iniquity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

No enumeration is complete, or intended to be complete. Isaiah's has special reference to the favorite <span class="accented">sins</span> of the time - injustice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-15.htm">Isaiah 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-23.htm">Isaiah 5:23</a>), oppression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-12.htm">Isaiah 3:12, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-7.htm">Isaiah 5:7</a>; etc.), the receiving of bribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-18.htm">Hosea 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>), and bloodshed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-3.htm">Isaiah 59:3</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet has thus run through the whole train of thought with a few rapid strides, in accordance with the custom which we have already frequently noticed; and now he commences afresh, mourning over the present miserable condition of things, in psalm-like elegiac tones, and weeping with his weeping people. "Behold, their heroes weep without; the messengers of peace weep bitterly. Desolate are roads, disappeared are travellers; he has broken covenant, insulted cities, despised men. The land mourns, languishes; Lebanon stands ashamed, parched; the meadow of Sharon has become like a steppe, and Bashan and Carmel shake their leaves." &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; is probably chosen with some allusion to 'Ariel, the name of Jerusalem in chapter 29; but it has a totally different meaning. We have rendered it "heroes," because &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; is here synonymous with &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; in the Nibelung-like piece contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-20.htm">2 Samuel 23:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-22.htm">1 Chronicles 11:22</a>. This 'a&#774;r&#305;&#772;'e&#772;l, which is here contracted into 'er'el (compare the biblical name 'Ar'e&#772;l&#305;&#772; and the post-biblical name of the angels, 'Er'ell&#305;&#772;m), is compounded of 'ar&#305;&#772; (a lion) and &#8219;El (God), and therefore signifies "the lion of God," but in this sense, that El (God) gives to the idea of leonine courage merely the additional force of extraordinary or wonderful; and as a composite word, it contents itself with a singular, with a collective sense according to circumstances, without forming any plural at all. The dagesh is to be explained from the fact that the word (which tradition has erroneously regarded as a compound of &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;) is pointed in accordance with the form &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1500; (&#1499;&#1512;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;). The heroes intended by the prophet were the messengers sent to Sennacherib to treat with him for peace. They carried to him the amount of silver and gold which he had demanded as the condition of peace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a>). But Sennacherib broke the treaty, by demanding nothing less than the surrender of Jerusalem itself. Then the heroes of Jerusalem cried aloud, when they arrived at Jerusalem, and had to convey this message of disgrace and alarm to the king and nation; and bitterly weeping over such a breach of faith, such deception and disgrace, the embassy, which had been sent off, to the deep self-humiliation of Judah and themselves, returned to Jerusalem. Moreover, Sennacherib continued to storm the fortified places, in violation of his agreement (on ma&#770;'as &#8219;ar&#305;&#772;m, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13</a>). The land was more and more laid waste, the fields were trodden down; and the autumnal aspect of Lebanon, with its faded foliage, and of Bashan and Carmel, with their falling leaves, looked like shame and grief at the calamities of the land. It was in the autumn, therefore, that the prophet uttered these complaints; and the definition of the time given in his prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-10.htm">Isaiah 32:10</a>) coincides with this. &#1511;&#1502;&#1500; is the pausal form for &#1511;&#1502;&#1500;, just as in other places an e&#772; with the tone, which has sprung from i, easily passes into a in pause; the sharpening of the syllable being preferred to the lengthening of it, not only when the syllable which precedes the tone syllable is an open one, but sometimes even when it is closed (e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-19.htm">Judges 6:19</a>, &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;). Instead of &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; we should read &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; (without the article), as certain codd. and early editions do.<p>(Note: We find the same in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>, and &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-4.htm">Isaiah 44:4</a>, whereas we invariably have &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; (see Michlol, 45b), just as we always find &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, and on the other hand &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;.)<p>Isaiah having mourned in the tone of the Psalms, now comforts himself with the words of a psalm. Like David in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>, he hears Jehovah speak. The measure of Asshur's iniquity is full; the hour of Judah's redemption is come; Jehovah has looked on long enough, as though sitting still (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-4.htm">Isaiah 18:4</a>). <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-10.htm">Isaiah 33:10</a> "Now will I arise, saith Jehovah, now exalt myself, now lift up myself." Three times does the prophet repeat the word &#8219;atta&#770;h (now), which is so significant a word with all the prophets, but more especially with Hosea and Isaiah, and which always fixes the boundary-line and turning-point between love and wrath, wrath and love. &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; (in half pause for &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1488; is contracted from &#1506;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; (Ges. 54, 2, b). Jehovah would rise up from His throne, and show Himself in all His greatness to the enemies of Israel. </body></html>
