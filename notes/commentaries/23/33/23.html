Having designed their army under the notion of a <span class="ital">gallant ship, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-21.htm" title="But there the glorious LORD will be to us a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.">Isaiah 33:21</a>,) he here represents their undone condition by the metaphor of a ship, tossed in a tempestuous sea, having her cables broke, and all her tacklings loose, so that she could have no benefit of her masts and sails; and therefore is quickly swallowed up. <span class="ital">They could not strengthen their mast </span>— Namely, the Assyrians could not, of whom he still speaks, as in the first clause he spake to them. <span class="ital">The lame take the prey </span>— They who came to spoil and prey upon my people, shall become a prey to them, and shall be forced to flee away so suddenly that they shall leave so many spoils behind them, that, when strong and active men have carried away all that they desired, there shall be enough left for the lame, who come last to the spoil. Thus God would bring good out of evil; and not only deliver Jerusalem, but enrich it, and abundantly recompense the losses it had sustained. <span class="ital">And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick </span>— As the lame shall take the prey, so shall the sick, notwithstanding their weakness, make a shift to get to the abandoned camp, and seize something for themselves. In this sense the clause is understood by Bishop Lowth, and many other interpreters. Or, the sense may be, There shall be such a universal transport of joy upon this occasion, that even the sick shall, for the present, forget their sickness, and the sorrows of it, and join with the public in its rejoicings; the deliverance of their city shall be their cure: or, they shall have no cause to complain of any sickness or calamity; they shall be fully delivered from all their enemies and troubles; and shall enjoy perfect tranquillity and prosperity. <span class="ital">The people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity </span>— This may be added, either, 1st, As the reason of the foregoing privilege; their sins, the main causes of their distresses, shall be pardoned; and therefore their sufferings, the effects of sin, shall cease: or, 2d, As an additional favour. They shall not only receive from me a glorious temporal deliverance, but, which is infinitely better, the pardon of all their sins, and all those spiritual and everlasting blessings which attend upon that mercy. Observe here, reader, sin is the sickness of the soul: when God pardons sin, he heals the disease; and when the diseases of sin are healed by pardoning mercy, the sting of bodily sickness is taken out, and the cause of it removed: so that either the inhabitant shall not be sick, or, at least, <span class="ital">shall not say, I am sick </span>— If iniquity be taken away, we have little reason to complain of outward affliction: <span class="ital">Son, be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee.</span> <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/33.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>33:15-24 The true believer watches against all occasions of sin. The Divine power will keep him safe, and his faith in that power will keep him easy. He shall want nothing needful for him. Every blessing of salvation is freely bestowed on all that ask with humble, believing prayer; and the believer is safe in time and for ever. Those that walk uprightly shall not only have bread given, and their water sure, but they shall, by faith, see the King of kings in his beauty, the beauty of holiness. The remembrance of the terror they were in, shall add to the pleasure of their deliverance. It is desirable to be quiet in our own houses, but much more so to be quiet in God's house; and in every age Christ will have a seed to serve him. Jerusalem had no large river running by it, but the presence and power of God make up all wants. We have all in God, all we need, or can desire. By faith we take Christ for our Prince and Saviour; he reigns over his redeemed people. All that refuse to have Him to reign over them, make shipwreck of their souls. Sickness is taken away in mercy, when the fruit of it is the taking away of sin. If iniquity be taken away, we have little reason to complain of outward affliction. This last verse leads our thoughts, not only to the most glorious state of the gospel church on earth, but to heaven, where no sickness or trouble can enter. He that blotteth out our transgressions, will heal our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy tacklings - This is evidently an address to Sennacherib. The mention of the war-galley and the ship seems to have suggested the application of the figure to the enemies of the Jews, and particularly to Sennacherib. The prophet, therefore, compares the Assyrian to a ship that was rendered unserviceable; whose sails were unfastened, and whose mast could not be made firm, and which was therefore at the mercy of winds and waves. The Hebrew which is rendered here 'thy tacklings are loosed,' means 'thy cords are let go;' that is, the cords or ropes that fastened the sails, the masts, and the rudder, were loosened. In such a condition the ship would, of course, go to ruin.<p>They could not well strengthen their mast - They could not fix it firm or secure. It is evident that if the mast cannot be made firm, it is impossible to navigate a ship. It is to be observed here, however, that the word which our translators have rendered 'well' (&#1499;&#1503;  ke&#770;n), not only signifies 'well' as an adverb, but is also used as a noun, and means a stand or station <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-13.htm">Genesis 40:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-13.htm">Genesis 41:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-20.htm">Daniel 11:20-21</a>; and also a base or pedestal (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-28.htm">Exodus 30:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-9.htm">Exodus 31:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-16.htm">Exodus 35:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-8.htm">Exodus 38:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-11.htm">Leviticus 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-31.htm">1 Kings 7:31</a>. It may be used here to denote the socket or base of the ship's mast; or the cross beam which the mast passed through, and which held it firm. This was called by the Greeks &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;  histopede&#772; (Odyssey xii. 51), or &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;, &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;  mesodme&#772;, histodoke&#772;. The translation, therefore, 'They could not make fast the base of their mast,' would better express the sense of the Hebrew. The Septuagint renders it: 'Thy mast gave way.'<p>They could not spread the sail - Of course, as the ropes were all loosened, and the mast could not be made firm, it Would be in vain to attempt to spread a sail. The sense is, that the plan of the Assyrian would be disconcerted, his scheme discomfited, and his enterprise would come to naught. He and his army would be like a vessel at sea without sails.<p>Then is the prey of a great spoil divided - The word 'divided' here means shall be distributed or apportioned, as plunder was usually among victors. The sense is, that much booty would be taken from the army of the Assyrian and distributed among the Jews (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-4.htm">Isaiah 33:4</a>). It is certain that Hezekiah had given to Sennacherib three hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold, and had stripped the temple, and given the gold that was on the temple to him <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14-16</a>, and tiffs treasure was doubtless in the camp of the Assyrians. And it is certain that after this invasion of Sennacherib, the treasures of Hezekiah were replenished, and his wealth so much abounded, that he made an improper and ostentatious display of it to the ambassadors that came from Babylon <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-13.htm">2 Kings 20:13-15</a>; and there is every presumption, therefore, that a great amount of spoil was collected from the camp of the Assyrian.<p>The lame take the prey - It shall be so abundant, and shall be so entirely abandoned by the Assyrians, that even the feeble and the defenseless shall go forth to the camp and take the spoil that is left. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. tacklings&#8212;Continuing the allegory in Isa 33:21, he compares the enemies' host to a war galley which is deprived of the tacklings or cords by which the mast is sustained and the sail is spread; and which therefore is sure to be wrecked on "the broad river" (Isa 33:21), and become the prey of Israel.<p>they&#8212;the tacklings, "hold not firm the base of the mast."<p>then&#8212;when the Assyrian host shall have been discomfited. Hezekiah had given Sennacherib three hundred talents of silver, and thirty of gold (2Ki 18:14-16), and had stripped the temple of its gold to give it to him; this treasure was probably part of the prey found in the foe's camp. After the invasion, Hezekiah had so much wealth that he made an improper display of it (2Ki 20:13-15); this wealth, probably, was in part got from the Assyrian.<p>the lame&#8212;Even the most feeble shall spoil the Assyrian camp (compare Isa 35:6; 2Sa 5:6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thy tacklings are loosed; </span> he directeth his speech to the Assyrians; and having tacitly designed their army under the notion of a gallant ship, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-21.htm" title="But there the glorious LORD will be to us a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.">Isaiah 33:21</a></span>, he here represents their broken and undone condition by the metaphor of a ship tossed in a tempestuous sea, having her cables broken, and all her tacklings loose, and out of order, so as she could have no benefit of her masts and sails; and therefore is quickly broken or swallowed up by the sea. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They; </span> the Assyrians, of whom he still speaks, as in the first clause he spake to them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey; </span> they who came to spoil and prey upon my people shall become a prey to them, and shall be forced to flee away so suddenly, that they shall leave so many spoils behind them, that when strong and active men have carried away all that they desired, there shall be enough left for the lame, who come last to the spoil. The general sense of the place is, that God’s people shall be victorious over all their enemies. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/33.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thy tacklings are loosed,.... Or "are left" (h); forsaken by the mariners, as being of no use and service: <p>they could not well strengthen their mast; with ropes to make it stand upright: <p>they could not spread the sail; upon the mast, without which they could not proceed. This is spoken to and of the enemies of the church; most interpreters understand it of the Assyrians, who are compared to a ship in great distress at sea, when its tacklings are shattered, the mast is split, and the sails cannot be spread. The metaphor is taken and carried on from <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-21.htm">Isaiah 33:21</a>, where mention is made of a galley with oars, and a gallant ship. Tyrannical governments are thought by some to be compared to ships; a king to the mast; princes to ropes, cords, and tackling; and their army in battle array to sails spread; but here all is in confusion, distress, and unavoidable ruin: this may very well be applied to the antichristian states, when the vials of God's wrath shall be poured out upon them; especially when the second vial shall be poured out upon the sea, and all shipping will suffer, as under the second trumpet the third part of ships were destroyed, there being a correspondence between the trumpets and the seals, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/8-8.htm">Revelation 8:8</a>, <p>then is the prey of a great spoil divided: as the spoil of the Assyrian camp was by the Israelites, so will the spoil of the Papists by the Protestants; particularly when the kings of the earth shall be filled with an aversion to the whore of Rome, and shall destroy her, and make her bare and desolate of all her riches, and shall "eat her flesh", or seize upon her substance, which will become the prey of a great spoil unto them: <p>the lame take the prey; which denotes both how easily it shall be taken, and what a plenty there shall be, that even such, and who come late, shall have a share in it. The Targum of the whole is, <p>"at that time (when vengeance shall be taken on Gog) the people shall be broken with their own strength, and they shall be like to a ship whose ropes are broken; and there is no strength in their mast, which is cut down, that it is not possible to spread a sail on it; then shall the house of Israel divide the substance of the people, the multitude of a prey and spoil; and although the blind and the lame are left among them, they also shall divide the multitude of the prey and spoil.'' <p>(h) So the word is interpreted by Kimchi and Ben Melech. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/33.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thy <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.</span><p>(a) He derides the Assyrians and enemies of the Church, declaring their destruction as they who perish by shipwreck.<p>(b) He comforts the Church, and shows that they will be enriched with all benefits both of body and soul.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/33.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. The abrupt transition from the glorious future to the present or the past, in the first part of the verse, is somewhat surprising at this point. It is not Assyria but Zion which is compared to an unseaworthy ship, a comparison natural enough in itself, as when we speak of the “ship of state.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Thy tacklings are loosed</span>] Or, <span class="bld">thy ropes hung slack</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they could not well strengthen, &c.</span>] <span class="bld">they could not hold fast the foot of their mast, they did not spread out the sail</span> (or, “the ensign”).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The subject here is the ropes; they could not serve the two purposes for which they were intended, supporting the mast and extending the sail. The word rendered <span class="ital">well</span> must from its position be a substantive; it denotes the <span class="greekheb">μεσόδμη</span>, the cross-beam into which the mast was let, or else the hole in the keel which received its foot (<span class="greekheb">ἱστοπέδη</span>). The rendering “sail” is doubtful. The word means elsewhere “ensign,” and one is tempted to translate it “flag.” But it is said that ships had no flags in ancient times (Cornill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-7.htm" title="Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which you spread forth to be your sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered you.">Ezekiel 27:7</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the prey of a great spoil</span>] Rather, “prey of spoil in abundance.” The expression “prey of spoil” is perhaps to be explained like the Latin <span class="ital">praeda exuviarum</span>. The figure of the ship is entirely dropped. On the word for “prey” see on ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm" title="For to us a child is born, to us a son is given: and the government shall be on his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.">Isaiah 9:6</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy tacklings are loosed</span>. The comparing of God to a river has led to the representation of Judah's enemies as warships (ver. 21). This causes Judah herself to be viewed as a ship - a badly appointed ship, which has to contend with one whose equipment is perfect. The prophet's thoughts have traveled back to the existing state of things. <span class="cmt_word">They could not well strengthen their mast</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they cannot hold firm the lower part of their mast</span>. The mast had its lower extremity inserted into a hole in a cross-beam, and required to be kept in place by the ropes. If they were loose, it might slip out of the hole and fall overboard. <span class="cmt_word">They could not spread the sail</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they cannot spread the ensign</span>. The ensign would seem to have been attached to the top of the mast. If the mast fell, it would no longer be spread out, so as to be seen. <span class="cmt_word">Then is the prey of a great spoil divided</span>. The word "then" is emphatic. <span class="accented">Now</span> the disabled ship seems incapable of coping with its enemy. <span class="accented">Then</span> (after Assyria's overthrow) Judah will obtain an immense spoil (see ver. 4). <span class="cmt_word">Even the lame shall have their portion.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Over this picture the prophet forgets the sinners in Zion, and greets with words of promise the thriving church of the future. "Thine eyes will see the king in his beauty, will see a land that is very far off." The king of Judah, hitherto so deeply humbled, and, as Micah instances by way of example, "smitten upon the cheeks," is then glorified by the victory of his God; and the nation, constituted as described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-16.htm">Isaiah 33:16</a>, will see him in his God-given beauty, and see the land of promise, cleared of enemies as far as the eye can reach and the foot carry, restored to Israel without reserve, and under the dominion of this sovereign enjoying all the blessedness of peace. </body></html>
