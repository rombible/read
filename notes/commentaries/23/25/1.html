True faith simply credits the Lord's testimony, and relies on his truth to perform his promises. As God weakens the strong who are proud and secure, so he strengthens the weak that are humble, and stay themselves upon him. God protects his people in all weathers. The Lord shelters those who trust in him from the insolence of oppressors. Their insolence is but the noise of strangers; it is like the heat of the sun scorching in the middle of the day; but where is it when the sun is set? The Lord ever was, and ever will be, the Refuge of distressed believers.

Not by creation and providence only, but by covenant and grace. This is the first and foundation blessing of grace, and secures all the rest; in this true happiness consists, and is preferable to every other enjoyment; the knowledge of it is come at in effectual calling, and by the witnessing of the Spirit; it is the highest attainment of grace to be assured of it; and though it is not always seen and known, it will always remain, and will be the glory of the New Jerusalem state, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>. These are the words, Aben Ezra says, either of the prophet, or of the ancients, before whom the Lord will reign, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>. Kimchi says of the latter, which seems very probable, these are the elders and representatives of the church; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-16.htm">Revelation 11:16</a>. <p>I will exalt thee;  the Lord God, Father, Son, and Spirit; the Father, by attributing the whole of salvation to his love and free favour; the Son, by ascribing deity to him, by making use of him in all his offices of Prophet, Priest, and King, and by giving him the glory of salvation wrought out by him; the Spirit, in his person, and the operations of his grace.

AS in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12.htm">Isaiah 12</a>, after describing the first setting up of Christ's kingdom and the call of the Gentiles, the prophet broke out into song, through joy at the tidings he was commissioned to announce, so now, having proclaimed the final establishment of the same kingdom in the heavenly Zion, he is again carried away by the sense of exultant gladness into a fresh <span class="accented">Lobgesang</span>, which he utters in his own person - not, as the former one, in the person of the Church. His song divides itself into three sections: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> vers. 1-5, a thanksgiving for deliverance; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> vers. 6-8, a commemoration of blessings granted; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> vers. 9-12, exultation in the security obtained. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou art my God; I will exalt thee</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-28.htm">Psalm 118:28</a>). To Isaiah the "Song of Moses" seems to have been a pattern thanksgiving, from which he delighted to draw his phrases when he was bent on formally singing praise to God. Compare the following: <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-2.htm">Isaiah 12:2</a>, "He is become my salvation;" the same with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-1.htm">Isaiah 25:1</a>, "He is my God; I will exalt him;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-16.htm">Isaiah 13:16</a>, "Hath dashed in pieces;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-7.htm">Exodus 15:7</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-14.htm">Isaiah 47:14</a>, "Consumed them as stubble;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-5.htm">Isaiah 46:5</a>,  "Who is like," etc.? the same with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-1.htm">Isaiah 25:1</a>, "Doing wonders;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-13.htm">Isaiah 8:13</a>, "Fear and dread;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-18.htm">Exodus 15:18</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>, "The Lord shall reign." <span class="cmt_word">Wonderful things</span>; <span class="cmt_word">thy counsels of old are</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">thou hast wrought wonders</span>, <span class="accented">counsels of old</span>, <span class="accented">faithfulness and truth</span>. The wonders for which God is praised were decreed in his counsels from all eternity; their accomplishment shows forth God's "faithfulness" and "truth." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This appeal is not made in vain. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16</a>. "From the border of the earth we hear songs: Praise to the Righteous One!" It no doubt seems natural enough to understand the term tzadd&#305;&#772;k (righteous) as referring to Jehovah; but, as Hitzig observes, Jehovah is never called "the Righteous One" in so absolute a manner as this (compare, however, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/112-4.htm">Psalm 112:4</a>, where it occurs in connection with other attributes, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-27.htm">Exodus 9:27</a>, where it stands in an antithetical relation); and in addition to this, Jehovah gives &#1510;&#1489;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-5.htm">Isaiah 28:5</a>), whilst &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;, and not &#1510;&#1489;&#1497;, is ascribed to Him. Hence we must take the word in the same sense as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10</a> (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a>). The reference is to the church of righteous men, whose faith has endured the fire of the judgment of wrath. In response to its summons to the praise of Jehovah, they answer it in songs from the border of the earth. The earth is here thought of as a garment spread out; cenaph is the point or edge of the garment, the extreme eastern and western ends (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>). Thence the church of the future catches the sound of this grateful song as it is echoed from one to the other.<p>The prophet feels himself, "in spirit," to be a member of this church; but all at once he becomes aware of the sufferings which will have first of all to be overcome, and which he cannot look upon without sharing the suffering himself. "Then I said, Ruin to me! ruin to me! Woe to me! Robbers rob, and robbing, they rob as robbers. Horror, and pit, and snare, are over thee, O inhabitant of the earth! And it cometh to pass, whoever fleeth from the tidings of horror falleth into the pit; and whoever escapeth out of the pit is caught in the snare: for the trap-doors on high are opened, and the firm foundations of the earth shake. The earth rending, is rent asunder; the earth bursting, is burst in pieces; the earth shaking, tottereth. The earth reeling, reeleth like a drunken man, and swingeth like a hammock; and its burden of sin presseth upon it; and it falleth, and riseth not again." The expression "Then I said" (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>) stands here in the same apocalyptic connection as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>, for example. He said it at that time in a state of ecstasy; so that when he committed to writing what he had seen, the saying was a thing of the past. The final salvation follows a final judgment; and looking back upon the latter, he bursts out into the exclamation of pain: ra&#770;z&#305;&#772;-l&#305;&#772;, consumption, passing away, to me (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-16.htm">Isaiah 10:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-4.htm">Isaiah 17:4</a>), i.e., I must perish (ra&#770;zi is a word of the same form as ka&#770;li, sha&#770;ni, &#8219;a&#770;ni; literally, it is a neuter adjective signifying emaciatum  equals  macies; Ewald, 749, g). He sees a dreadful, bloodthirsty people preying among both men and stores (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-1.htm">Isaiah 33:1</a>, for the play upon the word with &#1489;&#1490;&#1491;, root &#1490;&#1491;, cf., &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;, tecte agere, i.e., from behind, treacherously, like assassins). The exclamation, "Horror, and pit," etc. (which Jeremiah applies in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-43.htm">Jeremiah 48:43-44</a>, to the destruction of Moab by the Chaldeans), is not an invocation, but simply a deeply agitated utterance of what is inevitable. In the pit and snare there is a comparison implied of men to game, and of the enemy to sportsmen (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-16.htm">Jeremiah 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-19.htm">Lamentations 4:19</a>; yilla&#770;ce&#772;r, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-15.htm">Isaiah 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-13.htm">Isaiah 28:13</a>). The &#1506;&#1500; in &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; is exactly the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-9.htm">Judges 16:9</a> (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9</a>). They who should flee as soon as the horrible news arrived (min, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-3.htm">Isaiah 33:3</a>) would not escape destruction, but would become victims to one form if not to another (the same thought which we find expressed twice in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-19.htm">Amos 5:19</a>, and still more fully in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1-4</a>, as well as in a more dreadfully exalted tone). Observe, however, in how mysterious a background those human instruments of punishment remain, who are suggested by the word bo&#772;gdim (robbers). The idea that the judgment is a direct act of Jehovah, stands in the foreground and governs the whole. For this reason it is described as a repetition of the flood (for the opened windows or trap-doors of the firmament, which let the great bodies of water above them come down from on high upon the earth, point back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/8-2.htm">Genesis 8:2</a>, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-23.htm">Psalm 78:23</a>); and this indirectly implies its universality. It is also described as an earthquake. "The foundations of the earth" are the internal supports upon which the visible crust of the earth rests. The way in which the earth in its quaking first breaks, then bursts, and then falls, is painted for the ear by the three reflective forms in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-19.htm">Isaiah 24:19</a>, together with their gerundives, which keep each stage in the process of the catastrophe vividly before the mind. &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; is apparently an error of the pen for &#1512;&#1506;, if it is not indeed a n. actionis instead of the inf. absol. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-9.htm">Habakkuk 3:9</a>. The accentuation, however, regards the ah as a toneless addition, and the form therefore as a gerundive (like kob in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-25.htm">Numbers 23:25</a>). The reflective form &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1506;&#1506; is not the hithpalel of &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, vociferari, but the hithpoel of &#1512;&#1506;&#1506; (&#1512;&#1510;&#1509;), frangere. The threefold play upon the words would be tame, if the words themselves formed an anti-climax; but it is really a climax ascendens. The earth first of all receives rents; then gaping wide, it bursts asunder; and finally sways to and fro once more, and falls. It is no longer possible for it to keep upright. Its wickedness presses it down like a burden (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-5.htm">Psalm 38:5</a>), so that it now reels for the last time like a drunken man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-9.htm">Isaiah 29:9</a>), or a hammock (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>), until it falls never to rise again. </body></html>
