True faith simply credits the Lord's testimony, and relies on his truth to perform his promises. As God weakens the strong who are proud and secure, so he strengthens the weak that are humble, and stay themselves upon him. God protects his people in all weathers. The Lord shelters those who trust in him from the insolence of oppressors. Their insolence is but the noise of strangers; it is like the heat of the sun scorching in the middle of the day; but where is it when the sun is set? The Lord ever was, and ever will be, the Refuge of distressed believers.

In this interpretation also Vitringa and Cappellus coincide. But there is no need of supposing an error in the text. The idea is, probably, that of a fierce driving storm that would prostrate walls and houses; meaning a violent tempest, and intending to describe in a striking manner the severity of the calamities that had come upon the nation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. the poor &#8230; needy&#8212;the Jews, exiles from their country (Isa 26:6; 41:17).<p>heat&#8212;calamity (Isa 4:6; 32:2).<p>blast&#8212;that is, wrath.<p>storm&#8212;a tempest of rain, a winter flood, rushing against and overthrowing the wall of a house.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For thou hast been a strength to the poor, </span>& c.; for thou hast defended thy poor and helpless people against the fiercest assaults of their enemies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">When the blast of the terrible one is as a storm against the wall; </span> or, <span class="ital">for</span> (as this particle commonly signifies; or rather, <span class="ital">therefore</span>, as it is frequently used, because thou art their defender) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the blast of the terrible, </span> or <span class="ital">strong</span>, or <span class="ital">violent</span> one, was <span class="ital">like a storm</span> (of hail, or rain, or wind) <span class="ital">against a wall</span>, which makes a great and terrible noise, but without any effect, for the wall stands firm in spite of it.

The people of God, who are poor and needy, both in a literal and in a spiritual sense; and especially when under afflicted circumstances, in times of desertion, temptation, bodily affliction, and persecution from men, which may be here chiefly intended; to whom the Lord is a strength: he strengthens their hearts, and his own grace in them; he sheds abroad his love in their hearts, which makes their mountain to stand strong; he directs them to Christ, in whom is strength, as well as righteousness; he strengthens them by his Spirit, his promises, word, and ordinances. Christ may be more especially meant; and it may refer to the strength and power he will give to his people in the latter day; when a small one shall be a strong nation; when the feeble shall be as David, and the house of David as the angel of the Lord; when they shall have got the victory over the beast, his mark and image, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>, <p>a refuge from the storm; or tempestuous rain, or overflowing flood; as Christ is a refuge from the tempest and storm of divine wrath and vengeance, by his satisfaction and righteousness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a> so from the flood of persecution, by his power and providence, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/12-15.htm">Revelation 12:15</a>, <p>a shadow from the heat; which gives refreshment and rest, and is a protection from the scorching beams of the sun.

The idea is a little enlarged in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>. Its germ is, perhaps, to be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5, 6</a>. No writer accumulates striking images with such force and beauty as Isaiah. Primarily, the entire imagery has reference to what God will have done for his people when the final consummation arrives. Secondarily, a precious encouragement is held out to all who are undergoing their earthly trial and probation, who are taught where to look for a sure refuge in time of trouble. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But if the old earth passes away in this manner out of the system of the universe, the punishment of God must fall at the same time both upon the princes of heaven and upon the princes of earth (the prophet does not arrange what belongs to the end of all things in a "chronotactic" manner). They are the secrets of two worlds, that are here unveiled to the apocalyptic seer of the Old Testament. "And it cometh to pass in that day, Jehovah will visit the army of the high place in the high place, and the kings of the earth on the earth. And they are imprisoned, as one imprisons captives in the pit, and shut up in prison; and in the course of many days they are visited. And the moon blushes, and the sun turns pale: for Jehovah of hosts reigns royally upon Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before His elders is glory." With this doubly expressed antithesis of ma&#770;ro&#772;m and 'ada&#770;ma&#770;h (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-17.htm">Isaiah 23:17</a>) before us, brought out as it is as sharply as possible, we cannot understand "the army of the high place" as referring to certain earthly powers (as the Targum, Luther, Calvin, and Hvernick do). Moreover, the expression itself is also opposed to such an interpretation; for, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-18.htm">Isaiah 24:18</a> clearly shows, in which mimma&#770;rom is equivalent to missha&#770;maim (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-5.htm">Isaiah 33:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-23.htm">Isaiah 37:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>), &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501; &#1510;&#1489;&#1488; is synonymous with &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;; and this invariably signifies either the starry host (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>) or the angelic host (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-2.htm">Psalm 148:2</a>), and occasionally the two combined, without any distinction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-6.htm">Nehemiah 9:6</a>). As the moon and sun are mentioned, it might be supposed that by the "host on high" we are to understand the angelic host, as Abravanel, Umbreit, and others really do: "the stars, that have been made into idols, the shining kings of the sky, fall from their altars, and the kings of the earth from their thrones." But the very antithesis in the word "kings" (malche&#772;) leads us to conjecture that "the host on high" refers to personal powers; and the view referred to founders on the more minute description of the visitation (pa&#770;kad &#8219;al, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-3.htm">Isaiah 27:3</a>, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-21.htm">Isaiah 26:21</a>), "they are imprisoned," etc.; for this must also be referred to the heavenly host. The objection might indeed be urged, that the imprisonment only relates to the kings, and that the visitation of the heavenly host finds its full expression in the shaming of the moon and sun (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>); but the fact that the moon and sun are thrown into the shade by the revelation of the glory of Jehovah, cannot be regarded as a judgment inflicted upon them. Hence the commentators are now pretty well agreed, that "the host on high" signifies here the angelic army. But it is self-evident, that a visitation of the angelic army cannot be merely a relative and partial one. And it is not sufficient to understand the passage as meaning the wicked angels, to the exclusion of the good. Both the context and the parallelism show that the reference must be to a penal visitation in the spiritual world, which stands in the closest connection with the history of man, and in fact with the history of the nations. Consequently the host on high will refer to the angels of the nations and kingdoms; and the prophecy here presupposes what is affirmed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a> (lxx), and sustained in the book of Daniel, when it speaks of a sar of Persia, Javan, and even the people of Israel. In accordance with this exposition, there is a rabbinical saying, to the effect that "God never destroys a nation without having first of all destroyed its prince," i.e., the angel who, by whatever means he first obtained possession of the nation, whether by the will of God or against His will, has exerted an ungodly influence upon it. Just as, according to the scriptural view, both good and evil angels attach themselves to particular men, and an elevated state of mind may sometimes afford a glimpse of this encircling company and this conflict of spirits; so do angels contend for the rule over nations and kingdoms, either to guide them in the way of God or to lead them astray from God; and therefore the judgment upon the nations which the prophet here foretells will be a judgment upon angels also. The kingdom of spirits has its own history running parallel to the destinies of men. What is recorded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6</a> was a seduction of men by angels, and one of later occurrence than the temptation by Satan in paradise; and the seduction of nations and kingdoms by the host of heaven, which is here presupposed by the prophecy of Isaiah, is later than either. </body></html>
