True to what we may call the catholicity of his character, Isaiah looks forward to a time when the outlying heathen nations shall no longer be excluded from fellowship with Israel, but shall share in its sacrificial feasts even as at the banquet of the great King. In the Hebrew, as even in the English, the rhythm flows on like a strain of music appropriate to such a feast. The “wines on the lees” are those that have been allowed to ripen and clarify in the cask, and so, like the “fat things full of marrow,” represent the crowning luxuries of an Eastern banquet.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/isaiah/25.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Isaiah<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘IN THIS MOUNTAIN’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE FEAST ON THE SACRIFICE<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-6.htm" title="And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make to all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.">Isaiah 25:6</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There is here a reference to Sinai, where a feast followed the vision of God.

The Feast follows on Sacrifice.</span> We find that usage of a feast following a sacrifice existing in many races and religions. It seems to witness to a widespread consciousness of sin as disturbing our relations with God. These could be set right only by sacrifice, which therefore must precede all joyful communion with Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The New Testament accepts that truth and clears it from the admixture of heathenism.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> God provides the Sacrifice.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It is not brought by man. There is no need for our efforts-no atonement to be found by us. The sacrifice is not meant to turn aside God’s wrath.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Communion is possible through Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> In Him God is revealed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Objective hindrances are taken away.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Subjective ones are removed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Dark fears-indifference-dislike of fellowship-Sin-these make communion with God impossible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> At Sinai the elders ‘saw God, and did eat and drink’ Here the end of the preceding chapter shows the ‘elders’ gazing on the glory of Jehovah’s reign in Zion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The Feast consists of a Sacrifice.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Christ is the food of our souls, He and His work are meant to nourish our whole being. He is the object for all our nature.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The Sacrifice must be incorporated with us. It is not enough that it be offered, it must also be partaken of.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now the Sacrifice is eaten by faith, and by occupation with it of each part of our being, according to its own proper action. Through love, obedience, hope, desire, we may all feed on Jesus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The Lord’s Supper presents the same thoughts, under similar symbols, as Isaiah expressed in his prophecy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Symbolically we feast on the sacrifice when we eat the Bread which is the Body broken for us.

The guests invited are all people, Gentiles as well as Jews. There is that in the gospel which strengthens and makes glad the heart, and is fit for those who are under convictions of sin, and mourning for it. There is a veil spread over all nations, for all sat in darkness. But this veil the Lord will destroy, by the light of his gospel shining in the world, and the power of his Spirit opening men's eyes to receive it. He will raise those to spiritual life who were long dead in trespasses and sins. Christ will himself, in his resurrection, triumph over death. Grief shall be banished; there shall be perfect and endless joy. Those that mourn for sin shall be comforted. Those who suffer for Christ shall have consolations. But in the joys of heaven, and not short of them, will fully be brought to pass this saying, God shall wipe away all tears. The hope of this should now do away over-sorrow, all weeping that hinders sowing. Sometimes, in this world God takes away the reproach of his people from among men; however, it will be done fully at the great day. Let us patiently bear sorrow and shame now; both will be done away shortly.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And in this mountain - In mount Zion, that is, in Jerusalem. The following verses undoubtedly refer to the times of the Messiah. Several of the expressions used here are quoted in the New Testament, showing that the reference is to the Messiah, and to the fact that his kingdom would commence in Jerusalem. and then extend to all people.<p>Shall the Lord of hosts - (See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>.)<p>Make unto all people - Provide for all people. He shall adapt the provisions of salvation not only to the Jews, but to people everywhere. This is one of the truths on which Isaiah loved to dwell, and which in fact constitutes one of the peculiarities of his prophecy. It is one of the chief glories of the gospel, that it is unto all people. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-7.htm">Isaiah 57:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-19.htm">Daniel 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10</a> : 'I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be unto all people'<p>A feast - A feast, or entertainment, was usually observed, as it is now, on occasion of a great victory, or any other signal success. It is, therefore, emblematic of an occasion of joy. Here it is used in the twofold sense of an occasion of joy, and of an abundance of provisions for the necessities of those who should be entertained. This feast was to be prepared on mount Zion - in the provision which would be made in Jerusalem by the Messiah for the spiritual needs of the whole world. The arrangements for salvation arc often represented under the image of an ample and rich entertainment (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-16.htm">Luke 14:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-19.htm">Revelation 19:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11</a>).<p>Of fat things - Of rich delicacies. Fat things and marrow are often used as synonymous with a sumptuous entertainment, and are made emblematic Of the abundant provisions of divine mercy (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-2.htm">Isaiah 55:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8</a> : 'I shall be satisfied with the fatness of thy house. ')<p>A feast of wines on the lees - The word which is used here (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;  shema&#770;riym) is derived from &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;  sha&#770;mar, to keep, preserve, retain, and is applied usually to the lees or dregs of wine, because they retain the strength and color of the wine which is left to stand on them. It is also in this place applied to wine which has been kept on the lees, and is therefore synonymous with old wine; or wine of a rich color and flavor. This fact, that the color and strength of wine are retained by its being suffered to remain without being poured from one vessel into another, is more fully expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-11.htm">Jeremiah 48:11</a> :<p>Moab hath been at ease from his youth,<p>And he hath settled on his lees,<p>And hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel,<p>Neither hath he gone into captivity;<p>Therefore his taste remaineth in him,<p>And his scent is not changed.<p>Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-12.htm">Zephaniah 1:12</a>. It is well known that wines, unless retained for a considerable time on the lees, lose their flavor and strength, and are much less valuable (compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-10.htm">John 2:10</a>; notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>).<p>Of fat things full of marrow - Marrow is also an emblem of richness, or the delicacy of the entertainment <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a>.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. in this mountain&#8212;Zion: Messiah's kingdom was to begin, and is to have its central seat hereafter, at Jerusalem, as the common country of "all nations" (Isa 2:2, &c.).<p>all people&#8212;(Isa 56:7; Da 7:14; Lu 2:10).<p>feast&#8212;image of felicity (Ps 22:26, 27; Mt 8:11; Lu 14:15; Re 19:9; compare Ps 36:8; 87:1-7).<p>fat things&#8212;delicacies; the rich mercies of God in Christ (Isa 55:2; Jer 31:14; Job 36:16).<p>wines on the lees&#8212;wine which has been long kept on the lees; that is, the oldest and most generous wine (Jer 48:11).<p>marrow&#8212;the choicest dainties (Ps 63:5).<p>well refined&#8212;cleared of all dregs.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In this mountain; </span> in Mount Zion, to wit, in God’s church, which is very frequently meant by the names of Zion and Jerusalem, both in the Old and in the New Testament. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Make unto all people, </span> both Jews and Gentiles, who shall then be admitted to the participation of the same privileges and ordinances, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">a feast of fat things; </span> a feast made up of the most exquisite and delicate provisions; which is manifestly meant of the ordinances, graces, and comforts given by God in and to his church. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of wines on the lees; </span> which have continued upon the lees a competent time, whereby they gain strength, and afterwards drawn off from the lees, and so refined, as it is explained in the next clause. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things,....

Elaeochr. Myrothec. l. 1. c. 40. col. 205. thinks, that as the prophet speaks of the deliverance of believers from present troubles, and of good things at the coming of the Messiah, the metaphors are taken from the customs of that age, in which feasts were not prepared without the best of ointments; nor in a royal feast were the flesh of any animals used but such as were well fed and kept, and which, according to the law were pure and clean; and agreeably he renders the whole verse thus: <p>"and the Lord of hosts will make to all people a feast of ointments; a feast of those (animals) that are kept; of ointments full of marrow (the richest and fattest) of those that are kept''; <p>"pure" beasts, well kept and clean, according to the law of Moses. So Gussetius observes, that signifies not fat, but oil; and not "lees" of wine, but bottles in which wine is "kept", Comment. Ebr. p. 868, 872. The Syriac version of the latter part of the text, though not according to the original, is remarkable; <p>"the feast, I say, of our heavenly and most mighty quickener, reserved and fat.''. <p>The interpreter seems to have in his view the great master of the feast, our Lord Jesus Christ. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/25.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And on this <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> mountain shall the LORD of hosts make to all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.</span><p>(h) That is, in Zion, by which he means his Church, which would under Christ be assembled of the Jews and the Gentiles, and is here described under the figure of a costly banquet, as in Mt 22:2.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/25.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">in this mountain</span>] Mount Zion (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-23.htm" title="Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously.">Isaiah 24:23</a>), shewing that the author lived in Jerusalem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a feast</span> (lit. “banquet”) <span class="ital">of fat things … full of marrow</span>] The fat parts of the animal, which in ordinary sacrifice were reserved for the deity, were regarded in the East as the choicest delicacy.

What is signified is the admission of all nations to communion with the one true God, and, as a consequence of this, the cessation of all the evils of human life.

The Church of the redeemed contains men and women of all "nations and kindreds, and peoples, and tongues." <span class="cmt_word">A feast of fat things</span>. It follows from many passages of Holy Scripture that there is something in the final beatitude of man which is best represented to us in our present condition by the image of a "feast"  - something very different, no doubt, from the festive joy of which our Teutonic ancestors hoped to partake in the halls of Odin, but yet figured to us most fitly and appropriately by terms ordinarily used to describe earthly feasting. Our Lord tells of a "marriage supper," to which he will invite his friends (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-2.htm">Matthew 22:2-12</a>); and the scene of the "marriage supper of the Lamb, "according to St. John in the Revelation" (Revelation 19:7-9), is heaven. There man, it would seem, will partake of a sacrificial feast with his glorified Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-29.htm">Matthew 26:29</a>) - will eat the "heavenly manna," which is "angels' food" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-25.htm">Psalm 78:25</a>), and drink a spiritual drink which may be called "the fruit of the vine," deriving from this "eating" and "drinking" life and joy and strength. It has been already observed, in the Commentary upon Exodus (p. 581), that the sacrificial meal on Sinai, whereto the seventy elders were admitted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-9.htm">Exodus 24:9-11</a>), prefigured this heavenly feasting, and throws a certain light upon it. All gross and carnal ideas must, of course, be subtracted from the conception of the heavenly festivity; but it seems to be true to say that our author, and also St. John and our Lord himself, imply that in the world to come there will be a feast, at which God will be the Host, and all men, priests and laity alike, his guests, and receive from him the choicest and most exquisite gifts - gifts which will make them supremely happy (see Mr. Cheyne's note on the passage, p. 148). <span class="cmt_word">A feast of wines on the lees</span>. 'Wine which remained on its Ices, and was not poured off them into another vessel, was considered to be of especial strength (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-11.htm">Jeremiah 48:11</a>). Its defect was a want of clearness.

The connection of the words 'ase&#772;pha&#770;h 'assir is exactly the same as that of talte&#772;la&#770;h ga&#770;be&#772;r in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-17.htm">Isaiah 22:17</a> : incarceration after the manner of incarcerating prisoners; 'a&#770;saph, to gather together (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-14.htm">Isaiah 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-4.htm">Isaiah 33:4</a>), signifies here to incarcerate, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-17.htm">Genesis 42:17</a>. Both verbs are construed with &#8219;al, because the thrusting is from above downwards, into the pit and prison (&#8219;al embraces both upon or over anything, and into it, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-4.htm">1 Samuel 31:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-16.htm">Job 6:16</a>; see Hitzig on <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-12.htm">Nahum 3:12</a>). We may see from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a> and Jde 1:6 how this is to be understood. The reference is to the abyss of Hades, where they are reserved in chains of darkness unto the judgment of the great day. According to this parallel, yippa&#770;kedu (shall be visited) ought apparently to be understood as denoting a visitation in wrath (like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-6.htm">Isaiah 29:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-8.htm">Ezekiel 38:8</a>; compare pa&#770;kad followed by an accusative in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-21.htm">Isaiah 26:21</a>, also <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-14.htm">Isaiah 26:14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-6.htm">Psalm 59:6</a>; niphkad, in fact, is never used to signify visitation in mercy), and therefore as referring to the infliction of the final punishment. Hitzig, however, understands it as relating to a visitation of mercy; and in this he is supported by Ewald, Knobel, and Luzzatto. Gesenius, Umbreit, and others, take it to indicate a citation or summons, though without any ground either in usage of speech or actual custom. A comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-17.htm">Isaiah 23:17</a> in its relation to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-15.htm">Isaiah 23:15</a><p>(Note: Cf., Targ., Saad., "they will come into remembrance again.")<p>favours the second explanation, as being relatively the most correct; but the expression is intentionally left ambiguous. So far as the thing itself is concerned, we have a parallel in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1-3</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-7.htm">Revelation 20:7-9</a> : they are visited by being set free again, and commencing their old practice once more; but only (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a> affirms) to lose again directly, before the glorious and triumphant might of Jehovah, the power they have temporarily reacquired. What the apocalyptist of the New Testament describes in detail in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11</a>., and <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>, the apocalyptist of the Old Testament sees here condensed into one fact, viz., the enthroning of Jehovah and His people in a new Jerusalem, at which the silvery white moon (leba&#770;na&#770;h) turns red, and the glowing sun (chamma&#770;h) turns pale; the two great lights of heaven becoming (according to a Jewish expression) "like a lamp at noonday" in the presence of such glory. Of the many parallels to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a> which we meet with in Isaiah, the most worthy of note are <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a> to the concluding clause, "and before His elders is glory" (also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>), and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26</a> (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14</a>), with reference to the use of the word zeke&#772;nim (elders). Other parallels are <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a>, for chamma&#770;h and leba&#770;na&#770;h; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-29.htm">Isaiah 1:29</a>, for cha&#770;phe&#772;r and bo&#772;sh; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-22.htm">Isaiah 33:22</a>, for ma&#770;lak; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12</a>, for "Mount Zion and Jerusalem." We have already spoken at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16</a> of the word neged (Arab. Ne'gd, from na&#770;gad, njd, to be exalted; vid., opp. Arab. ga&#770;r, to be pressed down, to sink), as applied to that which stands out prominently and clearly before one's eyes. According to Hofmann (Schriftbeweis, i.-320-1), the elders here, like the twenty-four presbuteroi of the Apocalypse, are the sacred spirits, forming the council of God, to which He makes known His will concerning the world, before it is executed by His attendant spirits the angels. But as we find counsellors promised to the Israel of the new Jerusalem in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26</a>, in contrast with the bad zeke&#772;nim (elders) which it then possessed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14</a>), such as it had at the glorious commencement of its history; and as the passage before us says essentially the same with regard to the zeke&#772;nim as we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a> with regard to the festal meetings of Israel (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-20.htm">Isaiah 30:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1</a>); and still further, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a> (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>) is a more appropriate parallel to the passage before us than <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>, we may assume with certainty, at least with regard to this passage, and without needing to come to any decision concerning <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>, that the zeke&#772;nim here are not angels, but human elders after God's own heart. These elders, being admitted into the immediate presence of God, and reigning together with Him, have nothing but glory in front of them, and they themselves reflect that glory. </body></html>
