And it is not in vain to wait for him; for the mercy comes at last, with abundant recompence for the delay. The hands once stretched out upon the cross, to make way for our salvation, will at length be stretched forth to destroy all impenitent sinners. Moab is here put for all adversaries of God's people; they shall all be trodden down or threshed. God shall bring down the pride of the enemies by one humbling judgment after another. This destruction of Moab is typical of Christ's victory, and the pulling down of Satan's strong holds. Therefore, beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; for your labour is not in vain in the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the fortress ... - Thy strong defenses shall be destroyed.

"This mountain" is Zion, the seat of God's presence, and the place of His church's worship. The feast is therefore a spiritual one. The figure is taken, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-27.htm">Psalm 22:27</a>., from the sacrificial meals connected with the shela&#770;mim (the peace-offerings). Shema&#770;rim mezukka&#770;kim are wines which have been left to stand upon their lees after the first fermentation is over, which have thus thoroughly fermented, and have been kept a long time (from sha&#770;mar, to keep, spec. to allow to ferment), and which are then filtered before drinking (Gr. &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, i.e., &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c5;&#836;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; or &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;, from &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, percolare), hence wine both strong and clear. Memucha&#770;y&#305;&#772;m might mean emedullatae ("with the marrow taken out;" compare, perhaps, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-3.htm">Proverbs 31:3</a>), but this could only apply to the bones, not to the fat meat itself; the meaning is therefore "mixed with marrow," made marrowy, medullosae. The thing symbolized in this way is the full enjoyment of blessedness in the perfected kingdom of God. The heathen are not only humbled so that they submit to Jehovah, but they also take part in the blessedness of His church, and are abundantly satisfied with the good things of His house, and made to drink of pleasure as from a river (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-9.htm">Psalm 36:9</a>). The ring of the v. is inimitably pictorial. It is like joyful music to the heavenly feast. The more flexible form &#1502;&#1502;&#1495;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; (from the original, &#1502;&#1502;&#1495;&#1497;  equals  &#1502;&#1502;&#1495;&#1492;) is intentionally chosen in the place of &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1505;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;. It is as if we heard stringed instruments played with the most rapid movement of the bow. </body></html>
