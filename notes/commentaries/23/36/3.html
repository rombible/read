The change is clearly traceable to Isaiah’s influence.

He is there said to have been 'over the house,' and it is stated that he should be degraded from that office, and succeeded by Eliakim. It is possible, however, that Hezekiah retained him as scribe, or as secretary (see the analysis of <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-15.htm">Isaiah 22:15-25</a>).<p>And Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder - The "chronicler;" the officer to whom was entrusted the keeping of the records of state.

Eliakim had now taken the place of the Shebna who was "over the house" when Isaiah prophesied his downfall (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-19.htm">Isaiah 22:19</a>) and Eliakim's advancement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-21.htm">Isaiah 22:21-23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shebna the scribe</span>. It is not quite certain that this is the same "Shebna" as the former prefect of the palace, but the uncommonness of the name is a strong argument for the identity. The post of "scribe" or "secretary "(marginal rendering) was one of some importance (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-3.htm">1 Kings 4:3</a>), though inferior to that of palace prefect. <span class="cmt_word">Joah... the recorder</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-18.htm">2 Kings 18:18</a>, where the same three officials are mentioned in the same order). We learn from Kings that Sennacherib sent in reality three envoys (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a>) to Hezekiah - the Tartan, or "commander-in-chief;" the Rabsaris, or "chief eunuch;" and the Rabshakeh, or "rab-sak," the "chief captain," the second in command after the tartan. Hezekiah thought it right to appoint an equal number of officials to meet and confer with them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/35.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Then the eyes of the blind will be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped. Then will the lame man leap as the stag, and the tongue of the dumb man shout; for waters break out in the desert, and brooks in the steppe. And the mirage becomes a fish-pond, and the thirsty ground gushing water-springs; in the place of jackals, where it lies, there springs up grass with reeds and rushes." The bodily defects mentioned here there is no reason for regarding as figurative representations of spiritual defects. The healing of bodily defects, however, is merely the outer side of what is actually effected by the coming of Jehovah (for the other side, comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-3.htm">Isaiah 32:3-4</a>). And so, also, the change of the desert into a field abounding with water is not a mere poetical ornament; for in the last times, he era of redemption, nature itself will really share in the doxa which proceeds from the manifested God to His redeemed. Sha&#770;ra&#770;b (Arab. sara&#770;b) is essentially the same thing as that which we call in the western languages the mirage, or Fata morgana; not indeed every variety of this phenomenon of the refraction of light, through strata of air of varying density lying one above another, but more especially that appearance of water, which is produced as if by magic in the dry, sandy desert<p>(Note: See. G. Rawlinson, Monarchies, i. p. 38.)<p>(literally perhaps the "desert shine," just as we speak of the "Alpine glow;" see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-10.htm">Isaiah 49:10</a>). The antithesis to this is 'a&#774;gam (Chald. 'agma&#770;', Syr. egmo, Ar. agam), a fish-pond (as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-18.htm">Isaiah 41:18</a>, different from 'a&#770;ga&#770;m in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-10.htm">Isaiah 19:10</a>). In the arid sandy desert, where the jackal once had her lair and suckled her young (this is, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-3.htm">Lamentations 4:3</a>, the true explanation of the permutative ribhtsa&#770;h, for which ribhtsa&#770;m would be in some respects more suitable), grass springs up even into reeds and rushes; so that, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-20.htm">Isaiah 43:20</a> affirms, the wild beasts of the desert praise Jehovah. </body></html>
