In Christ there is enough for all, and enough for each. Those satisfied with the world, that see no need of Christ, do not thirst. They are in no uneasiness about their souls: but where God gives grace, he gives a thirst after it; and where he has given a thirst after it, he will give it. Come to Christ, for he is the Fountain opened, he is the Rock smitten. Come to holy ordinances, to the streams that make glad the city of our God. Come to the healing waters, come to the living waters, Re 22:17. Our Saviour referred to this, Joh 7:37. Come, and buy; make it your own by application of the grace of the gospel to yourselves. Come, and eat; make it still more your own, and enjoy it. The world comes short of our expectations; we promise ourselves, at least, water in it, and we are disappointed; but Christ outdoes our expectations. We come to him, and we find wine and milk. The gifts offered to us are such as no price can be set upon. The things offered are already paid for; for Christ purchased them at the full price of his own blood, 1Pe 1:19. Our wants are beyond number, and we have nothing to supply them; if Christ and heaven are ours, we see ourselves for ever indebted to free grace. Hearken diligently; let the proud heart stoop; not only come, but accept God's offers. All the wealth and pleasure in the world, will not yield solid comfort and content to the soul. They do not satisfy even the appetites of the body; for all is vanity and vexation. Let the disappointments we meet with in the world, help to drive us to Christ, and to seek for satisfaction in him only. Then, and not before, we shall find rest for our souls. Hear, and your soul shall live. On what easy terms is happiness offered us! By the sure mercies of David, we are to understand the Messiah. All his mercies are covenant mercies; they are purchased by him, they are promised in him, and out of his hand they are dispensed to us. We know not how to find the way to the waters, but Christ is given to be a Leader, a Commander, to show us what to do, and enable us to do it. Our business is to obey him, and follow him. And there is no coming to the Father but by him. He is the Holy One of Israel, true to his promises; and he has promised to glorify Christ, by giving him the heathen for his inheritance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/55.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, I have given him - This is evidently the language of God respecting the Messiah, or of David as representing the Messiah. Rosenmuller supposes that the name David here is used to designate the Messiah, and in support of this appeals to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23-24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-9.htm">Jeremiah 30:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>. An examination of these passages will show that they all refer to the Messiah by the name of David; and it is morally certain that in the passage before us, the name David <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a> suggested the Messiah. It seems to me that this is to be regarded as a direct address respecting the Messiah, and that the object of the speaker here is to state a reason why he should be embraced. That reason was that God had constituted him as a leader. The Chaldee renders this, 'Lo, I have constituted him as a prince to the people, a king and ruler over all kingdoms.' Kimchi says that it means that the Messiah would be a monitor or a mediator between people and him who would accuse them. Grotius supposes that Jeremiah is intended here; but in that opinion he is destined undoubtedly to stand forever alone. The almost unbroken interpretation, from the earliest times, is that which refers it directly to the Messiah.<p>For a witness to the people - Noyes renders this, 'A ruler.' Rosenmuller, 'A monitor,' - one whose office it was publicly to admonish, or reprove others in the presence of witnesses. Jerome renders it, 'A witness.' The Septuagint, &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  Marturion - 'A testimony.' The Chaldee (&#1512;&#1489;  rab), 'A prince.' The Hebrew word (&#1506;&#1491;  &#8219;e&#772;d) means properly "a witness" <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-5.htm">Proverbs 19:5-9</a>; then testimony, witness borne <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-17.htm">Deuteronomy 5:17</a>; then a prince, chief, lawgiver, commander. Compare the use of the verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-7.htm">Psalm 50:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-9.htm">Psalm 81:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-13.htm">Lamentations 2:13</a>. The parallelism requires us to understand it in this sense here - as one who stood forth to bear solemn testimony in regard to God to his law, and claims, and plans; and one who, therefore, was designated to be the instructor, guide, and teacher of people.<p>A leader - Chaldee, 'A king.' The idea is, that he would sustain the relation of a sovereign. One of the important offices of the Messiah is that of king.<p>A commander - Or, rather, a lawgiver. He would originate the laws and institutions of his people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/55.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. him&#8212;the mystical David (Eze 37:24, 25; Jer 30:9; Ho 3:5).

That is, the Messiah, as Aben Ezra, Kimchi, and Ben Melech rightly interpret it. This respects an act past in eternity, in God's eternal purposes and decrees, when he appointed Christ to the office of a Mediator; and this was an act of his grace, a free gift of his, flowing from his love to his people, both Jews and Gentiles, even all his elect, to whom Christ is a "witness", both of his father and of himself: of his father, of his good will to men, in forming the scheme of their salvation; of his love to sinners, in the mission of him; of his justice and holiness, which appear in his being the propitiation for sin; of his truth in his promises; of his whole mind and will, with respect to doctrine and worship: he is a witness of himself; of his deity and perfections; of his divine and eternal sonship; of his existence before his incarnation; of his Messiahship; of the end of his coming into the world; of his sufferings, death, and resurrection; of his second coming; and of the several characters he bears: he is a witness of the covenant itself, as well as the surety, Mediator, and messenger of it, and of truth in general; to which he has bore witness by his word and doctrines; by his works and miracles; by his sufferings and death; by the Scriptures of truth; by his Gospel, and the ministers of it; and by his spirit, and a faithful witness he is: <p>a leader and commander to the people; he is a "leader", as he is a teacher of his people, who teaches them to profit, and leads them in the way they should go; as a king that guides his subjects with the skilfulness of his hands, as David the type of him did; as a general leads out and on his armies to battle; as a shepherd leads his flock to good pastures; as a guide to those that know not the way; and as one that goes before others by way of example: Christ leads his people out of their own ways into his ways; and he leads them in a right way to the city of their habitation, to heaven at last; and he leads them on gradually and gently, as they are able to bear. He is a "commander" in a military way, a wise, powerful, valiant, and courageous one, and always victorious; and in a political sense, as a King commands his subjects, whose commands are to be obeyed; and indeed they are written on the hearts of his people; they are not grievous, though they cannot be performed in their own strength; nor is it designed that life and salvation should be obtained by the observance of them, but are done to testify subjection to Christ, and gratitude to him.

(<span class="ital">a</span>) Most modern authorities hold that the person spoken of in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-4.htm" title="Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.">Isaiah 55:4</a></span> is the historical David, and that <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/55-4.htm" title="Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people....">Isaiah 55:4-5</a></span> institute a parallel between the position he occupied in the heathen world of his time and that which Israel shall occupy in the future; the thought expressed, therefore, is that the Messianic hope is transferred from the dynasty to the nation. The view is thus succinctly stated by Driver; “as David became ruler of subject nations (2 Samuel 8), a knowledge of his religion, however imperfect, spread among them; thus he was a ‘witness’ to them. This position of David is idealised in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-43.htm" title="You have delivered me from the strivings of the people; and you have made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.">Psalm 18:43</a> (‘Thou makest me a <span class="ital">head of nations</span>; a people <span class="ital">whom I have not known shall serve me’</span>); and the position, as thus idealised, is here enlarged, and extended in a <span class="ital">spiritual</span> sense to Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-5.htm" title="Behold, you shall call a nation that you know not, and nations that knew not you shall run to you because of the LORD your God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he has glorified you.">Isaiah 55:5</a>).” (<span class="ital">Isaiah 2</span>, p. 156.) (<span class="ital">b</span>) Others think that the reference in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-4.htm" title="Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.">Isaiah 55:4</a></span> is to the future Messianic king (who is called David in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-9.htm" title="But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up to them.">Jeremiah 30:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-23.htm" title="And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.">Ezekiel 34:23</a> f.), so that the two verses represent under two aspects the future greatness of Israel. (<span class="ital">c</span>) An intermediate position is taken by some, viz., that <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-4.htm" title="Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.">Isaiah 55:4</a></span> goes back to the promise made to David, but regards it as one destined to be fulfilled in the person of his son the Messiah. It is very difficult to decide between these conflicting explanations. Against (<span class="ital">b</span>) and (<span class="ital">c</span>) it is urged (1) that the tenses in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-4.htm" title="Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.">Isaiah 55:4</a></span> are perfects and are naturally understood of the historic past, since those of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-5.htm" title="Behold, you shall call a nation that you know not, and nations that knew not you shall run to you because of the LORD your God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he has glorified you.">Isaiah 55:5</a></span> are futures. (2) The idea of a personal Messiah appears nowhere else in the prophecy. (3) A further objection, which however savours of fastidiousness, is that the Messiah is never named David <span class="ital">absolutely</span>, even in Jeremiah 30 and Ezekiel 34. On the other side it may be said, (1) that the distinction of tense is accounted for by the fact that <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-4.htm" title="Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.">Isaiah 55:4</a></span> speaks of what is really past (viz. Jehovah’s decree concerning the Messiah), whereas <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-5.htm" title="Behold, you shall call a nation that you know not, and nations that knew not you shall run to you because of the LORD your God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he has glorified you.">Isaiah 55:5</a></span> refers to a consequence still to be manifested. (2) Although the idea of the Messiah is not found elsewhere in the book, there is nothing in the prophet’s conceptions inconsistent with it; where he thinks of Israel as a restored nation he will naturally think of it as represented by a Davidic king. (3) Neither in the fundamental passage (2 Samuel 7) nor in any of those which point back to it (2 Samuel 23; Psalms 18, 89) is anything said of David being a “witness” to the true religion; and it could hardly occur to anyone to think of him as in the <span class="ital">first</span> instance a witness and in the <span class="ital">second</span> a prince. The third view (<span class="ital">c</span>) seems on the whole the best; the original covenant guarantees an endless dominion to the family of David, and after the restoration this will assume a spiritual character and expand into universal empire in the reign of the Messiah. This interpretation, however, is complicated by the further question as to the relation of the Messiah to the Servant of the Lord. If the Servant be the ideal Israel there is of course no difficulty; the two conceptions stand side by side and are independent. But if he be an individual, he is almost necessarily to be identified with the ideal king, although features are thus introduced into the portrait of the Messiah of which hardly a trace is found in the subsequent literature, until the conception of Messiahship through suffering and death was realised in Christ.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/55.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I have given him for a witness</span>. By ordinary rules of grammar, the pronoun "him" should refer to David; and   so the passage is understood by Gesenius, Maurer, Hitzig, Ewald, Knobel, Delitzsch, and Mr. Cheyne. But, as Isaiah frequently sets aside ordinary grammatical rules, and as the position to the person here spoken of seems too high for the historical David, a large number of commentators, including Vitringa, Michaelis, Dathe, Rosenmuller, Umbreit, and Dr. Kay, consider that the Messiah is intended.

For the verb gu&#772;r, the meaning "to gather together" (related to &#1488;&#1490;&#1512;), more especially to join together with hostile intention (cf., &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-19.htm">Revelation 19:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a>), is sustained by <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-7.htm">Psalm 56:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-4.htm">Psalm 59:4</a>; and with &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, lacessere, it has nothing to do (Hitzig and Ewald). &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498; has the force of contra te, as in the case of verbs of combat. The first apodosis is this: "but it takes place entirely away from me," i.e., without and against my will; &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;  equals  &#1502;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-21.htm">Isaiah 59:21</a>), and &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;  equals  &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, are no sure signs of a later usage; for this alternation of the two forms of &#1488;&#1514; is met with as early as <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-12.htm">Joshua 14:12</a>. The second apodosis is, "he will fall upon (or against) thee," or, as we should say, "founder," or "be wrecked." It is far more likely that this is the meaning of the words, than that they mean "he will fall to thy lot" (&#1506;&#1500; &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;, like &#1500; &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; elsewhere, to fall to a person); for the context here is a totally different one from <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>, and we look for nothing more than a declaration of the utter failure and ruin of the undertaking. </body></html>
