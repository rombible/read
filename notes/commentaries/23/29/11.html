The learned men, through prejudice, said that the Divine prophecies were obscure; and the poor urged their want of learning. The Bible is a sealed book to every man, learned or unlearned, till he begins to study it with a simple heart and a teachable spirit, that he may thence learn the truth and the will of God. To worship God, is to approach him. And if the heart be full of his love and fear, out of the abundance of it the mouth will speak; but there are many whose religion is lip-labour only. When they pretend to be speaking to God, they are thinking of a thousand foolish things. They worship the God of Israel according to their own devices. Numbers are only formal in worship. And their religion is only to comply with custom, and to serve their own interest. But the wanderings of mind, and defects in devotion, which are the believer's burden, are very different from the withdrawing of the heart from God, so severely blamed. And those who make religion no more than a pretence, to serve a turn, deceive themselves. And as those that quarrel with God, so those that think to conceal themselves from him, in effect charge him with folly. But all their perverse conduct shall be entirely done away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the vision of all - The vision of all the prophets; that is, all the revelations which God has made to you (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>). The prophet refers not only to his own communications, but to those of his contemporaries, and of all who had gone before him. The sense is, that although they had the communications which God had made to them, yet they did not understand them. They were as ignorant of their true nature as a man who can read is of the contents of a letter that is sealed up, or as a man who cannot read is of the contents of a book that is handed to him.<p>As the words of a book - Margin, 'Letter.'

The prophecies of all the prophets contained in the Scriptures; or all the prophecies in the book of Isaiah, concerning the Messiah, were no more seen, known, and understood, both by the priests and the people, than if they had been in a book, written, rolled up, and sealed. And this was owing, not to the obscurity of these writings, or because they were really sealed up, but to the blindness and stupidity of the people, whose eyes were closed, and their heads covered; and the prophecies of the Scriptures were only so to them, "unto you", not unto others; not to the apostles of Christ, whose understandings were opened by him, to understand the things written concerning him, in the law, in the prophets, and in the psalms; but the Jewish rulers, civil and ecclesiastical, as well as the common people, understood them not, though they were the means of fulfilling many of them; and they were as ignorant of the prophecies concerning their own ruin and destruction, for their rejection of Christ; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-27.htm">Luke 24:27</a>, <p>which men deliver to one that is learned; or, "that knows the book" (u); or "letters", as the Septuagint; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-15.htm">John 7:15</a> such were the Scribes, called  or "letter men", men that could read well, and understood language: <p>saying, Read this, I pray thee; or read this now, as the Targum, and interpret it, and tell the meaning of it: <p>and he saith, I cannot, for it is sealed; which Kimchi says was an excuse invented, because he had no mind to read it, or otherwise he could have said, open, and I will read it; or he might have broke off the seal; but knowing there were difficult things, and things hard to be understood, in it, did not care to look into it, and read it, and attempt to explain it to others. <p>(u)  "scienti librum", Montanus; , Sept.; "scienti literas", V.

The passage is interesting as illustrating the diffusion of literary education in Isaiah’s time (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/5-4.htm" title="Therefore I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish: for they know not the way of the LORD, nor the judgment of their God....">Jeremiah 5:4-5</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The vision of all</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the entire vision" - all that Isaiah has put before them in vers. 1-8. <span class="cmt_word">As the words of a book that is sealed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the words of a letter</span> (marginal rendering) or <span class="accented">writing</span>.

Now follows an unfolding of the words of promise, which stand at the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a> : "And it proves itself to me as Ariel." <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-5.htm">Isaiah 29:5-8</a> : "And the multitude of thy foes will become like finely powdered dust, and the multitude of the tyrants like chaff flying away; and it will take place suddenly, very suddenly. From Jehovah of hosts there comes a visitation with crash of thunder and earthquake and great noise, whirlwind and tempest, and the blazing up of devouring fire. And the multitude of all the nations that gather together against Ariel, and all those who storm and distress Ariel and her stronghold, will be like a vision of the night in a dream. And it is just as a hungry man dreams, and behold he eats; and when he wakes up his soul is empty: and just as a thirsty man dreams, and behold he drinks; and when he wakes up, behold, he is faint, and his soul is parched with thirst: so will it be to the multitude of the nations which gather together against the mountain of Zion." The hostile army, described four times as ha&#770;mo&#772;n, a groaning multitude, is utterly annihilated through the terrible co-operation of the forces of nature which are let loose upon them (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-30.htm">Isaiah 30:30</a>, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>). "There comes a visitation:" tippa&#770;qe&#772;d might refer to Jerusalem in the sense of "it will be visited" in mercy, viz., by Jehovah acting thus upon its enemies. But it is better to take it in a neuter sense: "punishment is inflicted." The simile of the dream is applied in two different ways: (1.) They will dissolve into nothing, as if they had only the same apparent existence as a vision in a dream. (2.) Their plan for taking Jerusalem will be put to shame, and as utterly brought to nought as the eating or drinking of a dreamer, which turns out to be a delusion as soon as he awakes. Just as the prophet emphatically combines two substantives from the same verbal root in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a>, and two adverbs from the same verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-5.htm">Isaiah 29:5</a>; so does he place &#1510;&#1489;&#1488; and &#1510;&#1489;&#1492; together in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-7.htm">Isaiah 29:7</a>, the former with &#1506;&#1500; relating to the crowding of an army for the purpose of a siege, the latter with an objective suffix (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/53-6.htm">Psalm 53:6</a>) to the attack made by a crowded army. The metso&#772;da&#770;h of Ariel (i.e., the watch-tower, specula, from tsu&#772;d, to spy)<p>(Note: In Arabic, also, masa&#770;d signifies a lofty hill or mountain-top, from a secondary form of tsud; and massara, to lay the foundations of a fortified city (&#8219;&#305;&#772;r ma&#770;tso&#772;r, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-22.htm">Psalm 31:22</a>), from tsu&#772;r.))<p>is the mountain of Zion mentioned afterwards in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-8.htm">Isaiah 29:8</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, as if; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-6.htm">Zechariah 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-19.htm">Job 10:19</a>. &#1488;&#1493;&#1499;&#1500; &#1493;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; without &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;; the personal pronoun is frequently omitted, not only in the leading participial clause, as in this instance (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-19.htm">Isaiah 40:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-29.htm">Psalm 22:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/25-2.htm">Job 25:2</a>; and Khler on <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-12.htm">Zechariah 9:12</a>), but also with a minor participial clause, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-10.htm">Psalm 7:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-20.htm">Psalm 55:20</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-10.htm">Habakkuk 2:10</a>. The hungering and thirsting of the waking man are attributed to his nephesh (soul: cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-6.htm">Isaiah 32:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30</a>), just because the soul is the cause of the physical life, and without it the action of the senses would be followed by no sensation or experience whatever. The hungry stomach is simply the object of feeling, and everything sensitive in the bodily organism is merely the medium of sensation or feeling; that which really feels is the soul. The soul no sooner passes out of the dreaming state into a waking condition, than it feels that its desires are as unsatisfied as ever. Just like such a dream will the army of the enemy, and that victory of which it is so certain before the battle is fought, fade away into nothing. </body></html>
