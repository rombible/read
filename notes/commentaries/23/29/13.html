Side by side with the great commandments of the Law and with the incisive teaching of the prophets there was growing up even then a traditional system of ethics and religion, based upon wrong principles, ending in a dishonest casuistry and a formal devotion. Commentaries even then were darkening counsel by words without knowledge, as they did in the Mishna and the Gemara of the later days of Judaism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-3.htm" title="But he answered and said to them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?">Matthew 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-6.htm" title="He answered and said to them, Well has Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.">Mark 7:6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/29.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/29-13.htm" title="Why the Lord said, For as much as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:...">Isaiah 29:13-14</a></span>. <span class="ital">Forasmuch as this people draw near </span>to <span class="ital">me </span>— Namely, in acts of worship; <span class="ital">with their mouth </span>— Speaking to me in prayer and praise, and promising and professing to serve me; <span class="ital">and with their lips do honour me </span>— With mere outward devotion and bodily worship; <span class="ital">but have removed their heart far from me </span>— Do not render me that love and gratitude, that regard and obedience, which I require; <span class="ital">and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men </span>— By mere human wisdom, and not by my word and Spirit.

This threatening was remarkably fulfilled in the Jews of our Lord’s time, who crucified him out of fear of the Romans, and thereby brought the Romans upon them! And “their learned rabbis, ever since, have minded little else but fabulous stories, and the Cabbalists have vented trifles for profound mysteries.” As, in rejecting Christ and his gospel, they removed their hearts far from God, therefore God justly removed wisdom far from them, and hid from their eyes the things that belonged even to their temporal peace.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:9-16 The security of sinners in sinful ways, is cause for lamentation and wonder. The learned men, through prejudice, said that the Divine prophecies were obscure; and the poor urged their want of learning. The Bible is a sealed book to every man, learned or unlearned, till he begins to study it with a simple heart and a teachable spirit, that he may thence learn the truth and the will of God. To worship God, is to approach him. And if the heart be full of his love and fear, out of the abundance of it the mouth will speak; but there are many whose religion is lip-labour only. When they pretend to be speaking to God, they are thinking of a thousand foolish things. They worship the God of Israel according to their own devices. Numbers are only formal in worship. And their religion is only to comply with custom, and to serve their own interest. But the wanderings of mind, and defects in devotion, which are the believer's burden, are very different from the withdrawing of the heart from God, so severely blamed. And those who make religion no more than a pretence, to serve a turn, deceive themselves. And as those that quarrel with God, so those that think to conceal themselves from him, in effect charge him with folly. But all their perverse conduct shall be entirely done away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore the Lord said - This verse, with the following, is designed to denounce the divine judgment on their formality of worship.

This pregnant criticism expresses with epigrammatic force the fundamental difference between the pagan and the biblical conceptions of religion. Religion, being personal fellowship with God, cannot be “learned” from men, but only by revelation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-17.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood has not revealed it to you, but my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 16:17</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">13, 14</span>. This spiritual insensibility of the people is the outcome of its whole religious attitude, which is insincere, formal, and traditional. The contrast implied is that between a religion of mere ritual and one of moral fellowship with God.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore the Lord said</span>; rather, <span class="accented">moreover the Lord said</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>This people draw near me with their mouth.</span> Samaria had been punished for open idolatry and flagrant neglect of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-17</a>). Jerusalem had not gone these lengths. She still, in profession, clung to the worship of Jehovah, and had even recently accepted a purification of religion at the hand of Hezekiah, who had "removed the high places," and cut down the groves, and broken in pieces the brazen serpent," because the people burnt incense to it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>). But her religion was a <span class="accented">mere</span> lip-service, which God detested - it was outward, formal, hypocritical (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>). Jerusalem, therefore, no less than Samaria, deserved and would receive a severe chastisement. But have removed their heart far from me. Here lies the gist of the charge. It was not that there was too much outward religion, but that there was no inward religion corresponding to it. Lip-service without inward religion is a mockery, though it is not always felt as such. <span class="cmt_word">Their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men</span>. Mr. Cheyne conjectures that ritual books had been already published by the authority of the priests, and that these were followed, on account of the human authority which had issued them, without any reference to the Law. Thus ritual obedience became mere obedience to "the precept of men." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Thus far does the unfolding of the hoi reach. Now follows an unfolding of the words of promise, which stand at the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a> : "And it proves itself to me as Ariel." <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-5.htm">Isaiah 29:5-8</a> : "And the multitude of thy foes will become like finely powdered dust, and the multitude of the tyrants like chaff flying away; and it will take place suddenly, very suddenly. From Jehovah of hosts there comes a visitation with crash of thunder and earthquake and great noise, whirlwind and tempest, and the blazing up of devouring fire. And the multitude of all the nations that gather together against Ariel, and all those who storm and distress Ariel and her stronghold, will be like a vision of the night in a dream. And it is just as a hungry man dreams, and behold he eats; and when he wakes up his soul is empty: and just as a thirsty man dreams, and behold he drinks; and when he wakes up, behold, he is faint, and his soul is parched with thirst: so will it be to the multitude of the nations which gather together against the mountain of Zion." The hostile army, described four times as ha&#770;mo&#772;n, a groaning multitude, is utterly annihilated through the terrible co-operation of the forces of nature which are let loose upon them (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-30.htm">Isaiah 30:30</a>, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>). "There comes a visitation:" tippa&#770;qe&#772;d might refer to Jerusalem in the sense of "it will be visited" in mercy, viz., by Jehovah acting thus upon its enemies. But it is better to take it in a neuter sense: "punishment is inflicted." The simile of the dream is applied in two different ways: (1.) They will dissolve into nothing, as if they had only the same apparent existence as a vision in a dream. (2.) Their plan for taking Jerusalem will be put to shame, and as utterly brought to nought as the eating or drinking of a dreamer, which turns out to be a delusion as soon as he awakes. Just as the prophet emphatically combines two substantives from the same verbal root in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a>, and two adverbs from the same verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-5.htm">Isaiah 29:5</a>; so does he place &#1510;&#1489;&#1488; and &#1510;&#1489;&#1492; together in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-7.htm">Isaiah 29:7</a>, the former with &#1506;&#1500; relating to the crowding of an army for the purpose of a siege, the latter with an objective suffix (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/53-6.htm">Psalm 53:6</a>) to the attack made by a crowded army. The metso&#772;da&#770;h of Ariel (i.e., the watch-tower, specula, from tsu&#772;d, to spy)<p>(Note: In Arabic, also, masa&#770;d signifies a lofty hill or mountain-top, from a secondary form of tsud; and massara, to lay the foundations of a fortified city (&#8219;&#305;&#772;r ma&#770;tso&#772;r, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-22.htm">Psalm 31:22</a>), from tsu&#772;r.))<p>is the mountain of Zion mentioned afterwards in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-8.htm">Isaiah 29:8</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, as if; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-6.htm">Zechariah 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-19.htm">Job 10:19</a>. &#1488;&#1493;&#1499;&#1500; &#1493;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; without &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;; the personal pronoun is frequently omitted, not only in the leading participial clause, as in this instance (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-19.htm">Isaiah 40:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-29.htm">Psalm 22:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/25-2.htm">Job 25:2</a>; and Khler on <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-12.htm">Zechariah 9:12</a>), but also with a minor participial clause, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-10.htm">Psalm 7:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-20.htm">Psalm 55:20</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-10.htm">Habakkuk 2:10</a>. The hungering and thirsting of the waking man are attributed to his nephesh (soul: cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-6.htm">Isaiah 32:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30</a>), just because the soul is the cause of the physical life, and without it the action of the senses would be followed by no sensation or experience whatever. The hungry stomach is simply the object of feeling, and everything sensitive in the bodily organism is merely the medium of sensation or feeling; that which really feels is the soul. The soul no sooner passes out of the dreaming state into a waking condition, than it feels that its desires are as unsatisfied as ever. Just like such a dream will the army of the enemy, and that victory of which it is so certain before the battle is fought, fade away into nothing. </body></html>
