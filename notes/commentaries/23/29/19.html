Men had been weary of the name of the Holy One of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-11.htm" title="Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.">Isaiah 30:11</a>). In that better time it should be the source of joy and peace for the poor and the lowly, on whom Isaiah looked with all the yearnings of a prophet’s sympathy.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:17-24 The wonderful change here foretold, may refer to the affairs of Judah, though it looks further. When a great harvest of souls was gathered to Christ from among the Gentiles, then the wilderness was turned into a fruitful field; and the Jewish church, that had long been a fruitful field, became as a deserted forest. Those who, when in trouble, can truly rejoice in God, shall soon have cause greatly to rejoice in him. The grace of meekness contributes to the increase of our holy joy. The enemies who were powerful shall become mean and weak. To complete the repose of God's people, the scorners at home shall be cut off by judgements. All are apt to speak unadvisedly, and to mistake what they hear, but it is very unfair to make a man an offender for a word. They did all they could to bring those into trouble who told them of their faults. But He that redeemed Abraham out of his snares and troubles, will redeem those who are, by faith, his true seed, out of theirs. It will be the greatest comfort to godly parents to see their children renewed creatures, the work of God's grace. May those who now err in spirit, and murmur against the truth, come to understanding, and learn true doctrine. The Spirit of truth shall set right their mistakes, and lead them into all truth. This should encourage us to pray for those that have erred, and are deceived. All who murmured at the truths of God, as hard sayings, shall learn and be aware what God designed in all. See the change religion produces in the hearts of men, and the peace and pleasure of a humble and devout spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The meek - The word 'meek' usually refers to those who are patient in the reception of injuries, but the Hebrew word used here (&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;  &#8219;a&#774;na&#770;viym) means properly the oppressed, the afflicted, the unhappy <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-13.htm">Psalm 9:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/10-12.htm">Psalm 10:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-17.htm">Psalm 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>.

The "meek", lowly, and humble, are such who are made sensible of sin, and become humble under a sense of it; who see the insufficiency of their own righteousness, and submit to the righteousness of Christ; who attribute all they have, and are, to the free grace of God, and quietly submit to every dispensation of Providence; who are not easily provoked by men, but bear much and long without reviling; who envy not those that are above them in gifts and grace, nor despise those that are below them, and think the worst of themselves, and the best of others; now these have joy in the Lord, in the Word of the Lord, as the Targum, in the Lord Jesus Christ; in the greatness and glory of his person as Jehovah, and so able to save to the uttermost; in him as the Lord their righteousness; in his blood and sacrifice, for the pardon and expiation of their sins; in his fulness as theirs, to supply their wants; in his salvation, being so great, so full, so free, and suitable to them: and whereas their joy may be interrupted through the corruptions of their hearts, the temptations of Satan, and divine desertions, they "shall add" (a) joy in the Lord, as in the original; they shall repeat it, it shall come again, it shall be restored unto them, and they shall afresh exercise it, and "increase" in it, as we render it; for spiritual joy may be increased by the discoveries of the love of God; by fresh views of Christ, through an increase of knowledge of him, and faith in him; by means of meditation and prayer, and by reading and hearing the word: <p>and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel; or, "the poorest of men" (b), who were so in a literal sense; for such were the persons, both among Jews and Gentiles, who in the first times of the Gospel were brought to the knowledge of Christ, and faith in him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-4.htm">Matthew 11:4</a> or such who are "poor in spirit"; not only spiritually poor, but who are sensible of their spiritual poverty, and apply to Christ for the true riches of grace: the words may be rendered, "Adam's poor"; such who are impoverished by Adam's fall, and are sensible of it; these, perceiving durable riches and righteousness, even unsearchable riches, in Christ, rejoice in him, "the Holy One of Israel"; who is holy in himself, the sanctifier of others, and is made satisfaction to all his people. The Targum is, <p>"in the word of the Holy One of Israel.'' <p>This joy is not carnal, but spiritual; it is the fruit of the Spirit of God, and is called joy in the Holy Ghost; as it also is the joy of faith, which goes along with it, is through it, and increases as that does; it is peculiar to believers, unknown to the world, and is unspeakable, and full of glory: and such kind of rejoicing, and an increase of it, are what belong to Gospel times. <p>(a) "et addent", V.

The "evangelical prophet" anticipates the gospel in this, among other points - that he promises his choicest blessings, not to the rich and mighty, but to the poor and meek (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This stupefaction was the self-inflicted punishment of the dead works with which the people mocked God and deceived themselves. "The Lord hath spoken: Because this people approaches me with its mouth, and honours me with its lips, and keeps its heart far from me, and its reverence of me has become a commandment learned from men: therefore, behold, I will proceed wondrously with this people, wondrously and marvellously strange; and the wisdom of its wise men is lost, and the understanding of its intelligent men becomes invisible." Ever since the time of Asaph (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50.htm">Psalm 50</a>, cf., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-36.htm">Psalm 78:36-37</a>), the lamentation and condemnation of hypocritical ceremonial worship, without living faith or any striving after holiness, had been a leading theme of prophecy. Even in Isaiah's introductory address (chapter 1) this complain was uttered quite in the tone of that of Asaph. In the time of Hezekiah it was peculiarly called for, just as it was afterwards in that of Josiah (as the book of Jeremiah shows). The people had been obliged to consent to the abolition of the public worship of idols, but their worship of Jehovah was hypocrisy. Sometimes it was conscious hypocrisy, arising from the fear of man and favour of man; sometimes unconscious, inasmuch as without any inward conversion, but simply with work-righteousness, the people contented themselves with, and even prided themselves upon, an outward fulfilment of the law (<a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>). Instead of &#1504;&#1490;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; (lxx, Vulg., Syr., <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-6.htm">Mark 7:6</a>), we also meet with the reading &#1504;&#1490;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;, "because this people harasses itself as with tributary service;" but the antithesis to richaq (lxx &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3c9; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; ) favours the former reading niggash, accedit; and beph&#305;&#772;v (with its moth) must be connected with this, though in opposition to the accents. This self-alienation and self-blinding, Jehovah would punish with a wondrously paradoxical judgment, namely, the judgment of a hardening, which would so completely empty and confuse, that even the appearance of wisdom and unity, which the leaders of Israel still had, would completely disappear. &#1497;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-5.htm">Isaiah 38:5</a>) is not the third person fut. hiphil here (so that it could be rendered, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>, "Behold, I am he who;" or more strictly still, "Behold me, who;" which, however, would give a prominence to the subject that would be out of place here), but the part. kal for &#1497;&#1493;&#1505;&#1507;. That the language really allowed of such a lengthening of the primary form qati&#774;l into qat&#305;&#772;l, and especially in the case of &#1497;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507;, is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:18</a> (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5</a>). In &#1493;&#1508;&#1500;&#1488; &#1492;&#1508;&#1500;&#1488;, &#1508;&#1500;&#1488; (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-9.htm">Lamentations 1:9</a>) alternates with the gerundive (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-17.htm">Isaiah 22:17</a>): the fifth example in this one address of the emphatic juxtaposition of words having a similar sound and the same derivation (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-5.htm">Isaiah 29:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-7.htm">Isaiah 29:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-9.htm">Isaiah 29:9</a>). </body></html>
