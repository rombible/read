When a great harvest of souls was gathered to Christ from among the Gentiles, then the wilderness was turned into a fruitful field; and the Jewish church, that had long been a fruitful field, became as a deserted forest. Those who, when in trouble, can truly rejoice in God, shall soon have cause greatly to rejoice in him. The grace of meekness contributes to the increase of our holy joy. The enemies who were powerful shall become mean and weak. To complete the repose of God's people, the scorners at home shall be cut off by judgements. All are apt to speak unadvisedly, and to mistake what they hear, but it is very unfair to make a man an offender for a word. They did all they could to bring those into trouble who told them of their faults. But He that redeemed Abraham out of his snares and troubles, will redeem those who are, by faith, his true seed, out of theirs. It will be the greatest comfort to godly parents to see their children renewed creatures, the work of God's grace. May those who now err in spirit, and murmur against the truth, come to understanding, and learn true doctrine. The Spirit of truth shall set right their mistakes, and lead them into all truth. This should encourage us to pray for those that have erred, and are deceived. All who murmured at the truths of God, as hard sayings, shall learn and be aware what God designed in all. See the change religion produces in the hearts of men, and the peace and pleasure of a humble and devout spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They also that erred in spirit - (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-9.htm">Isaiah 29:9-10</a>).<p>Shall learn doctrine - When" this would occur the prophet does not state.

"Is it not yet a very little, and Lebanon is turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field esteemed as a forest? And in that day the deaf hear scripture words, and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity and out of darkness. And the joy of the humble increases in Jehovah, and the poor among men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. For tyrants are gone, and it is over with scoffers; and all who think evil are rooted out, who condemn a man for a word, and lay snares for him that is free-spoken in the gate, and overthrow the righteous through shameful lies." The circumstances themselves, as well as the sentence passed, will experience a change, in complete contrast with the present state of things. This is what is affirmed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-17.htm">Isaiah 29:17</a>; probably a proverb transposed into a more literary style. What is now forest becomes ennobled into garden ground; and what is garden ground becomes in general estimation a forest (&#1500;&#1499;&#1512;&#1502;&#1500;, &#1500;&#1497;&#1506;&#1512;, although we should rather expect &#1500;, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-15.htm">Isaiah 32:15</a>). These emblems are explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-18.htm">Isaiah 29:18</a>. The people that are now blind and deaf, so far as the word of Jehovah is concerned, are changed into a people with open ears and seeing eyes. Scripture words, like those which the prophet now holds before the people so unsuccessfully, are heard by those who have been deaf. The unfettered sight of those who have been blind pierces through the hitherto surrounding darkness. The heirs of the new future thus transformed are the ana&#770;v&#305;&#772;m ("meek") and the 'ebhyo&#772;n&#305;&#772;m ("poor"). &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; (the antithesis of &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>) heightens the representation of lowliness; the combination is a superlative one, as in &#1492;&#1510;&#1488;&#1503; &#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-20.htm">Jeremiah 49:20</a>, and &#1492;&#1510;&#1488;&#1503; &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-7.htm">Zechariah 11:7</a> (cf., &#1495;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; &#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-9.htm">Isaiah 35:9</a>): needy men who present a glaring contrast to, and stand out from, the general body of men. Such men will obtain ever increasing joy in Jehovah (ya&#770;saph as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-31.htm">Isaiah 37:31</a>). Such a people of God would take the place of the oppressors (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-12.htm">Isaiah 28:12</a>) and scoffers (cf., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-14.htm">Isaiah 28:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-22.htm">Isaiah 28:22</a>), and those who thought evil (sha&#770;qad, invigilare, sedulo agere), i.e., the wretched planners, who made a &#1495;&#1496;&#1488; of every one who did not enter into their plans (i.e., who called him a cho&#772;te&#772;'; cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-4.htm">Deuteronomy 24:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:5</a>), and went to law with the man who openly opposed them in the gate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10</a>; yeqo&#772;shu&#772;n, possibly the perf. kal, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-24.htm">Jeremiah 50:24</a>; according to the syntax, however, it is the fut. kal of qu&#772;sh  equals  ya&#770;qo&#772;sh: see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-16.htm">Isaiah 26:16</a>; Ges. 44, Anm. 4), and thrust away the righteous, i.e., forced him away from his just rights (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-2.htm">Isaiah 10:2</a>), by to&#772;hu&#772;, i.e., accusations and pretences of the utmost worthlessness; for these would all have been swept away. This is the true explanation of the last clause, as given in the Targum, and not "into the desert and desolation," as Knobel and Luzzatto suppose; for with Isaiah to&#772;hu&#772; is the synonym for all such words as signify nothingness, groundlessness, and fraud. The prophet no doubt had in his mind, at the time that he uttered these words, the conduct of the people towards himself and his fellow-prophets, and such as were like-minded with them. The charge brought against him of being a conspirator, or a traitor to his country, was a to&#772;hu&#772; of this kind. All these conspirators and persecutors Jehovah would clear entirely away. </body></html>
