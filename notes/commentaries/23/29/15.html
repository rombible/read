The learned men, through prejudice, said that the Divine prophecies were obscure; and the poor urged their want of learning. The Bible is a sealed book to every man, learned or unlearned, till he begins to study it with a simple heart and a teachable spirit, that he may thence learn the truth and the will of God. To worship God, is to approach him. And if the heart be full of his love and fear, out of the abundance of it the mouth will speak; but there are many whose religion is lip-labour only. When they pretend to be speaking to God, they are thinking of a thousand foolish things. They worship the God of Israel according to their own devices. Numbers are only formal in worship. And their religion is only to comply with custom, and to serve their own interest. But the wanderings of mind, and defects in devotion, which are the believer's burden, are very different from the withdrawing of the heart from God, so severely blamed. And those who make religion no more than a pretence, to serve a turn, deceive themselves. And as those that quarrel with God, so those that think to conceal themselves from him, in effect charge him with folly.

The allusion is to the schemes which were afloat for calling in the aid of Egypt. As Isaiah had long since denounced these schemes as the height of folly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-11.htm">Isaiah 19:11-17</a>), and prophesied their failure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-5.htm">Isaiah 20:5, 6</a>), every effort was made to conceal them from his knowledge end from the knowledge of all who were like-minded (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1, 2</a>). Steps were probably even now being taken for the carrying out of the schemes, which were studiously concealed from the prophet. <span class="cmt_word">Their works are in the dark.</span> Underhand proceedings ere at all times suspicious. "Men love darkness rather than light, <span class="accented">because their deeds are evil</span>."

The wicked persuade themselves that God does not see their actions. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This enigma of the future the prophet holds out before the eyes of his contemporaries. The prophet received it by revelation of Jehovah; and without the illumination of Jehovah it could not possibly be understood. The deep degradation of Ariel, the wonderful deliverance, the sudden elevation from the abyss to this lofty height - all this was a matter of faith. But this faith was just what the nation wanted, and therefore the understanding depending upon it was wanting also. The shemu&#8219;a&#770;h was there, but the b&#305;&#772;na&#770;h was absent; and all &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1492; &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; was wrecked on the obtuseness of the mass. The prophet, therefore, who had received the unhappy calling to harden his people, could not help exclaiming (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-9.htm">Isaiah 29:9</a>), "Stop, and stare; blind yourselves, and grow blind!" &#1492;&#1514;&#1502;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;&#1468;, to show one's self delaying (from &#1502;&#1492;&#1492;&#1468;, according to Luzzatto the reflective of &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;&#1468;, an emphatic form which is never met with), is connected with the synonymous verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;&#1468;, to be stiff with astonishment; but to &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1506;, to be plastered up, i.e., incapable of seeing (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>), there is attached the hithpalpel of the same verb, signifying "to place one's self in such circumstances," se oblinere (differently, however, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-16.htm">Psalm 119:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-47.htm">Psalm 119:47</a>, compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-8.htm">Isaiah 11:8</a>, se permulcere). They could not understand the word of God, but they were confused, and their eyes were, so to speak, festered up: therefore this self-induced condition would become to them a God-appointed punishment. The imperatives are judicial words of command.<p>This growth of the self-hardening into a judicial sentence of obduracy, is proclaimed still more fully by the prophet. "They are drunken, and not with wine; they reel, and not with meth. For Jehovah hath poured upon you a spirit of deep sleep, and bound up your eyes; the prophets and your heads, the seers, He has veiled. And the revelation of all this will be to you like words of a sealed writing, which they give to him who understands writing, saying, Pray, read this; but he says, I cannot, it is sealed. And they give the writing to one who does not understand writing, saying, Pray, read this; but he says, I do not understand writing." They were drunken and stupid; not, however, merely because they gave themselves up to sensual intoxication (&#1497;&#1497;&#1503;, dependent upon &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, ebrii vino), but because Jehovah had given them up to spiritual confusion and self-destruction. All the punishments of God are inflicted through the medium of His no less world-destroying than world-sustaining Spirit, which, although not willing what is evil, does make the evil called into existence by the creature the means of punishing evil. Tarde&#772;ma&#770;h is used here to signify the powerless, passive state of utter spiritual insensibility. This judgment had fallen upon the nation in all its members, even upon the eyes and heads of the nation, i.e., the prophets. Even they whose duty is was to see to the good of the nation, and lead it, were blind leaders of the blind; their eyes were fast shut (&#1506;&#1510;&#1468;&#1501;, the intensive form of the kal, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>; Aram. &#1506;&#1510;&#1468;&#1501;; Talmud also &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1509;: to shut the eyes, or press them close), and over their heads a cover was drawn, as over sleepers in the night. Since the time of Koppe and Eichhorn it has become a usual thing to regard &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1492;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1501; as a gloss, and indeed as a false one (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-13.htm">Isaiah 9:13-14</a>); but the reason assigned - namely, that Isaiah's polemics are directed not against the prophets, but against the stupid staring people - is utterly groundless (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>, and the polemics of his contemporary Micah, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-5.htm">Isaiah 3:5-8</a>). Moreover, the author of a gloss would have been more likely to interpret &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; by &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; or &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-24.htm">Job 9:24</a>). And <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-11.htm">Isaiah 29:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-12.htm">Isaiah 29:12</a> are also opposed to this assumption of a gloss. For by those who understood what was written (se&#772;pher), it is evident that the prophets and rulers of the nation are intended; and by those who did not understand it, the great mass of the people. To both of them, "the vision of all," i.e., of all and everything that God had shown to His true prophets, was by the judgment of God completely sealed. Some of them might have an outward knowledge; but the inward understanding of the revelation was sealed to them. Some had not even this, but stared at the word of the prophet, just as a man who cannot read stares at what is written. The chethib has &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;; the keri &#1505;&#1508;&#1512;, though without any ground, since the article is merely generic. Instead of &#1504;&#1488;&#1470;&#1494;&#1492; &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;, we should write &#1494;&#1492; &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1470;&#1504;&#1488; in both cases, as certain codices and old editions do. </body></html>
