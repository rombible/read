This appears from several passages of their poets, Homer, Virgil, Horace. The pretenders to the art of necromancy, who were chiefly women, had an art of speaking with a reigned voice, so as to deceive those who applied to them, by making them believe that it was the voice of the ghost. They had a way of uttering sounds, as if they were formed, not by the organs of speech, but deep in the chest, or in the belly, and were thence called <span class="greekheb">εγγαστριμυθοι</span>, <span class="ital">ventriloqui. </span>They could make the voice seem to come from beneath the ground, from a distant part, in another direction, and not from themselves, the better to impose upon those who consulted them. From these arts of the necromancers, the popular notion seems to have arisen that the ghost’s voice was a weak, stridulous, almost an inarticulate sort of sound, very different from the speech of the living.” — Bishop Lowth.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:1-8 Ariel may signify the altar of burnt-offerings. Let Jerusalem know that outward religious services will not make men free from judgements. Hypocrites never can please God, nor make their peace with him. God had often and long, by a host of angels, encamped round about Jerusalem for protection and deliverance; but now he fought against it. Proud looks and proud language shall be brought down by humbling providences. The destruction of Jerusalem's enemies is foretold. The army of Sennacherib went as a dream; and thus the multitudes, that through successive ages fight against God's altar and worship, shall fall.

God regards the armies which he would employ as under his control, and speaks of them as if he would do it himself (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>).<p>Round about - (&#1499;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;  kadu&#770;r). As in a circle; that is, he would encompass or encircle the city. The word used here     &#1491;&#1493;&#1512;  du&#770;r in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-18.htm">Isaiah 22:18</a>, means a ball, but here it evidently means a circle; and the sense is, that the army of the besiegers would encompass the city. A similar form of expression occurs in regard to Jerusalem in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-43.htm">Luke 19:43</a> : 'For the days shall come upon thee, than thine enemies shall cast a trench (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;  charaka - "a rampart," a "mound") about thee &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;  soi "against thee"), and "compass thee round" &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3b5;  perikuklo&#772;sousi se, "encircle thee").' So also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-20.htm">Luke 21:20</a>. The Septuagint renders this, 'I will encompass thee as David did;' evidently reading it as if it were &#1499;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;  kadu&#770;d; and Lowth observes that two manuscripts thus read it, and he himself adopts it. But the authority for correcting the Hebrew text in this way is not sufficient, nor is it necessary. The idea in the present reading is a clear one, and evidently means that the armies of Sennacherib would encompass the city.<p>With a mount - A rampart; a fortification. Or, rather, perhaps, the word &#1502;&#1510;&#1489;  mutsa&#770;b means a post, a military station, from &#1497;&#1510;&#1489;  ya&#770;tsab, "to place, to station." The word in this form occurs nowhere else in the Scriptures, but the word &#1502;&#1510;&#1489;  matsa&#770;b occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-23.htm">1 Samuel 13:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-1.htm">1 Samuel 14:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-4.htm">1 Samuel 14:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-14.htm">2 Samuel 23:14</a>, in the sense of a military post, or garrison.<p>I will rise forts - That is, ramparts, such as were usually thrown up against a besieged city, meaning that it should be subjected to the regular process of a siege. The Septuagint reads, &#x3a0;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  Purgou; 'Towers;' and so also two manuscripts by changing the Hebrew letter &#1491;  (d) into the Hebrew letter &#1512;  (r). But there is no necessity for altering the Hebrew text. Lowth prefers the reading of the Septuagint. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

There was small chance of forcing an entrance into Jerusalem on any side except the north; but, order to distress and harass her, an enemy with numerous forces would dispose them all round the walls, thus preventing all ingress or egress (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-43.htm">Luke 19:43</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And... lay siege against thee with a mount</span>; or, <span class="accented">with a mound</span>. Artificial mounds were raised up against the walls of cities by the Assyrians, as a foundation from which to work their battering rams with greater advantage against the upper and weaker portion of the defenses (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 80). <span class="cmt_word">And... raise forts against thee.</span> "Forts" were usually movable, and accompanied the battering-ram for its better protection. Archers in the forts cleared the walls of their defenders, while the ram was employed in making a breach (see Layard, 'Monuments of Nineveh,' Second Series, p. 21). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div> The address of the prophet is here apparently closed. But an essential ingredient is still wanting to the second half, to make it correspond to the first. There is still wanting the fringe of promise coinciding with <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-5.htm">Isaiah 28:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-6.htm">Isaiah 28:6</a>. The prophet has not only to alarm the scoffers, that if possible he may pluck some of them out of the fire through fear (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-23.htm">Judges 5:23</a>); he has also to comfort believers, who yield themselves as disciples to him and to the word of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-16.htm">Isaiah 8:16</a>). He does this here in a very peculiar manner. He has several times assumed the tone of the mashal, more especially in chapter 26; but here the consolation is dressed up in a longer parabolical address, which sets forth in figures drawn from husbandry the disciplinary and saving wisdom of God. Isaiah here proves himself a master of the mashal. In the usual tone of a mashal song, he first of all claims the attention of his audience as a teacher of wisdom. V. 23 "Lend me your ear, and hear my voice; attend, and hear my address!" Attention is all the more needful, that the prophet leaves his hearers to interpret and apply the parable themselves. The work of a husbandman is very manifold, as he tills, sows, and plants his field. Vv. 24-26 "Does the ploughman plough continually to sow? to furrow and to harrow his land? Is it not so: when he levels the surface thereof, he scatters black poppy seed, and strews cummin, and puts in wheat in rows, and barley in the appointed piece, and spelt on its border? And He has instructed him how to act rightly: his God teaches it him." The ploughing (cha&#770;rash) which opens the soil, i.e., turns it up in furrows, and the harrowing (sidde&#772;d) which breaks the clods, take place to prepare for the sowing, and therefore not interminably, but only so long as it necessary to prepare the soil to receive the seed. When the seed-furrows have been drawn in the levelled surface of the ground (shivva&#770;h), then the sowing and planting begin; and this also takes place in various ways, according to the different kinds of fruit. Qetsach is the black poppy (nigella sativa, Arab. habbe soda, so called from its black seeds), belonging to the ranunculaceae. Kammo&#772;n was the cummin (cuminum cyminum) with larger aromatic seeds, Ar. kammu&#772;n, neither of them our common carraway (Kmmel, carum). The wheat he sows carefully in rows (so&#772;ra&#770;h, ordo; ad ordinem, as it is translated by Jerome), i.e., he does not scatter it about carelessly, like the other two, but lays the grains carefully in the furrows, because otherwise when they sprang up they would get massed together, and choke one another. Nisma&#770;n, like so&#772;ra&#770;h, is an acc. loci: the barley is sown in a piece of the field specially marked off for it, or specially furnished with signs (s&#305;&#772;ma&#770;n&#305;&#772;m); and kussemeth, the spelt (&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;, also mentioned by Homer, Od. iv 604, between wheat and barley), along the edge of it, so that spelt forms the rim of the barley field. It is by a divine instinct that the husbandman acts in this manner; for God, who established agriculture at the creation (i.e., Jehovah, not Osiris), has also given men understanding. This is the meaning of v'yissero&#772; lammishpa&#770;t: and (as we may see from all this) He (his God: the subject is given afterwards in the second clause) has led him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1</a>) to the right (this is the rendering adopted by Kimchi, whilst other commentators have been misled by <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>, and last of all Malbim Luzzatto, "Cosi Dio con giustizia corregge;" he would have done better, however, to say, con moderazione). </body></html>
