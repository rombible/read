Those who in the day of their peace were proud, and haughty, and terrible, are quite dispirited when trouble comes. Their faces shall be scorched with the flame. All comfort and hope shall fail. The stars of heaven shall not give their light, the sun shall be darkened. Such expressions are often employed by the prophets, to describe the convulsions of governments. God will visit them for their iniquity, particularly the sin of pride, which brings men low. There shall be a general scene of horror. Those who join themselves to Babylon, must expect to share her plagues, Re 18:4. All that men have, they would give for their lives, but no man's riches shall be the ransom of his life. Pause here and wonder that men should be thus cruel and inhuman, and see how corrupt the nature of man is become. And that little infants thus suffer, which shows that there is an original guilt, by which life is forfeited as soon as it is begun. The day of the Lord will, indeed, be terrible with wrath and fierce anger, far beyond all here stated. Nor will there be any place for the sinner to flee to, or attempt an escape. But few act as though they believed these things.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth - This comparison is often used in the Scriptures to denote the deepest possible pain and sorrow, as well as the suddenness with which any calamity comes upon a people <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-6.htm">Psalm 48:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-3.htm">Isaiah 21:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-14.htm">Isaiah 42:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-21.htm">Jeremiah 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-23.htm">Jeremiah 22:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-24.htm">Jeremiah 49:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-43.htm">Jeremiah 50:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-13.htm">Hosea 13:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/4-9.htm">Micah 4:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-21.htm">John 16:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>.<p>They shall be amazed one at another - They shall stare with a stupid gaze on one another, indicating a state of great distress, anxiety, and alarm.

When grief and anguish come upon us, the face becomes inflamed. The face in fear is usually pale. But the idea here is not so much that of fear as of anguish; and, perhaps, there is mingled also here the idea of indignation against their invaders. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. pangs&#8212;The Hebrew means also a "messenger."

From whom it issues, and to whom or against whom it is directed, still remains a secret; but this only adds to the intensity."On woodless mountain lift ye up a banner, call to them with loud sounding voice, shake the hand, that they may enter into gates of princes!" The summons is urgent: hence a threefold signal, viz., the banner-staff planted on a mountain "made bald" (nishpeh, from which comes shephi, which only occurs in Isaiah and Jeremiah), the voice raised high, and the shaking of the hand, denoting a violent beckoning - all three being favourite signs with Isaiah. The destination of this army is to enter into a city of princes (ned&#305;&#772;b&#305;&#772;m, freemen, nobles, princes, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-40.htm">Psalm 107:40</a>, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/113-8.htm">Psalm 113:8</a>), namely, to enter as conquerors; for it is not the princes who invite them, but Jehovah. </body></html>
