It is significant, as pointing to some widely-diffused legend, that the Persian name for the constellation is <span class= "ital">Nimrod </span>and the Arabian <span class= "ital">Giant. </span>In Greek mythology Orion is a giant hunter, conspicuous for acts of outrage against the gods, and finally slain by Zeus. It is obvious that the words in their first application had a figurative, and not a literal, fulfilment. Such imagery has been at all times the natural symbolism of a time of terror (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-31.htm" title="The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.">Joel 2:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-15.htm" title="The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.">Joel 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm" title="Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:">Matthew 24:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-24.htm" title="But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,">Mark 13:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-25.htm" title="And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;">Luke 21:25</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:6-18 We have here the terrible desolation of Babylon by the Medes and Persians. Those who in the day of their peace were proud, and haughty, and terrible, are quite dispirited when trouble comes. Their faces shall be scorched with the flame. All comfort and hope shall fail. The stars of heaven shall not give their light, the sun shall be darkened. Such expressions are often employed by the prophets, to describe the convulsions of governments. God will visit them for their iniquity, particularly the sin of pride, which brings men low. There shall be a general scene of horror. Those who join themselves to Babylon, must expect to share her plagues, Re 18:4. All that men have, they would give for their lives, but no man's riches shall be the ransom of his life. Pause here and wonder that men should be thus cruel and inhuman, and see how corrupt the nature of man is become. And that little infants thus suffer, which shows that there is an original guilt, by which life is forfeited as soon as it is begun. The day of the Lord will, indeed, be terrible with wrath and fierce anger, far beyond all here stated. Nor will there be any place for the sinner to flee to, or attempt an escape. But few act as though they believed these things.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the stars of heaven - This verse cannot be understood literally, but is a metaphorical representation of the calamities that were coming upon Babylon The meaning of the figure evidently is, that those calamities would be such as would be appropriately denoted by the sudden extinguishment of the stars, the sun, and the moon. As nothing would tend more to anarchy, distress, and ruin, than thus to have all the lights of heaven suddenly and forever quenched, this was an apt and forcible representation of the awful calamities that were coming upon the people. Darkness and night, in the Scriptures, are often the emblem of calamity and distress (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>). The revolutions and destructions of kingdoms and nations are often represented in the Scriptures under this image. So respecting the destruction of Idumea <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a> :<p>And all the hosts of heaven shall be dissolved,<p>And the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll;<p>And all their host shall fall down,<p>As the leaf falleth from off the vine,<p>And as a falling fig from the fig-tree.<p>So in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7-8</a>, in a prophecy respecting the destruction of Pharaoh, king of Egypt:<p>And when I shall put time out,<p>I will cover the heavens, and make the stoa thereof dark,<p>I will cover the sun with a cloud,<p>And the moon shall not give her light.<p>And the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee.<p>And set darkness upon thy land.<p>(Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/3-15.htm">Joel 3:15-16</a>.)

There may be a literal fulfilment finally, shadowed forth under this imagery (Re 21:1).<p>constellations&#8212;Hebrew, "a fool," or "impious one"; applied to the constellation Orion, which was represented as an impious giant (Nimrod deified, the founder of Babylon) chained to the sky.

This and what follows are to be understood, not literally, but figuratively, as expressive of the dismalness and gloominess of the dispensation, of the horror and terror of it, in which there was no light, no comfort, no relief, nor any hope of any; the heavens and all the celestial bodies frowning upon them, declaring the displeasure of him that dwells there: <p>and the constellations thereof shall not give their light; which are assemblages of stars, or certain configurations of the heavenly bodies, devised by the ancients; to which each of the names are given for the help of the imagination and memory; the number of them are forty eight, twelve in the Zodiac, twenty one on the northern side of it, and fifteen on the southern. R. Jonah, mentioned both by Aben Ezra and Kimchi, says that "Cesil", the word here used, is a large star, called in the Arabic language "Suel", and the stars that are joined unto it are called by its name "Cesilim"; so that, according to this, only one constellation is meant; and Aben Ezra observes, that there are some that say that Cesil is a star near to the south pole, on which, if camels look, they die; but, says he, in my opinion it is "the scorpion's heart". Jerom's Hebrew master interpreted it to him Arcturus; and it is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-9.htm">Job 9:9</a> rendered Orion, and by the Septuagint here; which is one of the constellations, and one of the brightest; and the word being here in the plural number, the sense may be, were there ever so many Orions in the heavens, they should none of them give light. The Targum and Jarchi interpret it of the planets: <p>the sun shall be darkened in his going forth; as soon as it rises, when it goes forth out of its chamber, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-5.htm">Psalm 19:5</a> either by an eclipse of it, or by dark clouds covering it: <p>and the moon shall not cause her light to shine: by night, which she borrows from the sun; so that it would be very uncomfortable, day and night, neither sun, moon, nor stars appearing, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-20.htm">Acts 27:20</a> by the sun, moon, and stars, may be meant king, queen, and nobles, whose destruction is here prophesied of; it being usual in prophetic language, as well as in other writers (f), to express great personages hereby. <p>(f) "Solem Asiae Brutum appellat, stellasque salubres appellat comites", Hor.

Nature sympathizes with her Lord. When he is angry, the light of the heavens grows dark.
