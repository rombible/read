For, as Bishop Lowth observes, the Hebrew writers, “to express happiness, prosperity, the instauration and advancement of states, kingdoms, and potentates, make use of images taken from the most striking parts of nature; from the heavenly bodies, from the sun, moon, and stars, which they describe as shining with increased splendour, and never setting; the moon becomes like the meridian sun, and the sun’s light is augmented seven-fold: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-26.htm" title="Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD binds up the breach of his people, and heals the stroke of their wound.">Isaiah 30:26</a>. New heavens and a new earth are created, and a brighter age commences. On the contrary, the overthrow and destruction of kingdoms are represented by opposite images; the stars are obscured, the moon withdraws her light, and the sun shines no more; the earth quakes, and the heavens tremble; and all things seem tending to their original chaos.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:6-18 We have here the terrible desolation of Babylon by the Medes and Persians. Those who in the day of their peace were proud, and haughty, and terrible, are quite dispirited when trouble comes. Their faces shall be scorched with the flame. All comfort and hope shall fail. The stars of heaven shall not give their light, the sun shall be darkened. Such expressions are often employed by the prophets, to describe the convulsions of governments. God will visit them for their iniquity, particularly the sin of pride, which brings men low. There shall be a general scene of horror. Those who join themselves to Babylon, must expect to share her plagues, Re 18:4. All that men have, they would give for their lives, but no man's riches shall be the ransom of his life. Pause here and wonder that men should be thus cruel and inhuman, and see how corrupt the nature of man is become. And that little infants thus suffer, which shows that there is an original guilt, by which life is forfeited as soon as it is begun. The day of the Lord will, indeed, be terrible with wrath and fierce anger, far beyond all here stated. Nor will there be any place for the sinner to flee to, or attempt an escape. But few act as though they believed these things.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The day of the Lord cometh - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a>.<p>Cruel - (&#1488;&#1499;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;  'akeza&#772;r&#305;&#770;y). This does not mean that "God" is cruel, but that the 'day of Yahweh' that was coming should be unsparing and destructive to them. It would be the exhibition of "justice," but not of "cruelty;" and the word stands opposed here to mercy, and means that God would not spare them.

The language of Isa 13:9-13 can only primarily and partially apply to Babylon; fully and exhaustively, the judgments to come, hereafter, on the whole earth. Compare Isa 13:10 with Mt 24:29; Re 8:12. The sins of Babylon, arrogancy (Isa 13:11; Isa 14:11; 47:7, 8), cruelty, false worship (Jer 50:38), persecution of the people of God (Isa 47:6), are peculiarly characteristic of the Antichristian world of the latter days (Da 11:32-37; Re 17:3, 6; 18:6, 7, 9-14, 24).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Cruel both with wrath and fierce anger; </span> divers words are heaped together, to signify the extremity of his anger. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The sinners thereof; </span> the inhabitants of that city, who were guilty of so much idolatry and cruelty, and all sorts of luxury. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Behold, the day of the Lord cometh,....

"To my wrath" is to be explained in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>. To execute His wrath He had summoned His "sanctified ones" (mekudda&#770;shim), i.e., according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-7.htm">Jeremiah 22:7</a> (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27-28</a>), those who had already been solemnly consecrated by Him to go into the battle, and had called the heroes whom He had taken into His service, and who were His instruments in this respect, that they rejoiced with the pride of men intoxicated with victory (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7</a>, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-11.htm">Isaiah 3:11</a>). &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1494; is a word peculiarly Isaiah's; and the combination &#1490;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1494;&#1497; is so unusual, that we could hardly expect to find it employed by two authors who stood in no relation whatever to one another. </body></html>
