The vision of the glory of the far-off king comes to an end, and the prophet returns to the more immediate surroundings of his time. The “word” which Jehovah sends is the prophetic message that follows. It is a question whether the terms “Jacob” and “Israel” stand in the parallelism of identity or contrast, but the use of the former term in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm" title="And many people shall go and say, Come you, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/2-5.htm" title="O house of Jacob, come you, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.">Isaiah 2:5-6</a>, makes the former use more probable. In this case both names stand practically for the kingdom of Judah as the true representative of Israel, the apostate kingdom of the Ten Tribes being no longer worthy of the name, and therefore described here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-5.htm" title="Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against you, saying,">Isaiah 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-8.htm" title="For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within three score and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.">Isaiah 7:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-17.htm" title="The LORD shall bring on you, and on your people, and on your father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.">Isaiah 7:17</a>, simply as Ephraim. The occasion of the prophecy is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-9.htm" title="And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,">Isaiah 9:9</a>. Pekah, the king of Ephraim, was still confident in his strength, and in spite of his partial failure, and the defeat of his ally (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-9.htm" title="And the king of Assyria listened to him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.">2Kings 16:9</a>), derided the prophet’s prediction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/9-8.htm" title="The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it has lighted on Israel....">Isaiah 9:8-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Lord sent a word, </span>&c. — A prophetical and threatening message by me: for now the prophet, having inserted some consolatory passages for the support of God’s faithful people, returns to his former work of commination against the rebellious Israelites; <span class="ital">and it lighted </span>— Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">נפל</span>, <span class="ital">it fell, </span>that is, it shall fall in the prophetical style.

We have here the third section of the fifth discourse, which reaches to the fifth verse of the next chapter, “and makes,” says Bishop Lowth, “a distinct prophecy, and a just poem, remarkable for the regularity of its disposition, and the elegance of its plan. It has no relation to the preceding or following prophecy, which relate principally to the kingdom of Judah; whereas, this is addressed exclusively to the kingdom of Israel. The subject of it is a denunciation of vengeance awaiting their crimes. It is divided into four parts, each threatening the particular punishment of some grievous offence; of their pride; of their perseverance in their vices; of their impiety; and of their injustice. To which is added a general denunciation of a further reserve of divine wrath, contained in a distich before used by the prophet on a like occasion, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-25.htm" title="Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he has stretched forth his hand against them, and has smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcasses were torn in the middle of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.">Isaiah 5:25</a>,) and here repeated after each part: this makes the intercalary verse of the poem; or, as we call it, the burden of the song.” <span class="ital">And all the people shall know </span>— Namely, by experience. They shall know whether my word be true or false. <span class="ital">Even Ephraim, </span>&c. — The people of the ten tribes, and particularly Ephraim, the proudest of them all. <span class="ital">And Samaria </span>— The strongest place, and the seat of the king and court. Here we have the first fault of the Ephraimites, namely, the pride and contempt with which they had received the threatenings of the true prophets of God, who had denounced to them the unhappy consequences of their undertakings. Elevated with vain hope, they had declared that they would never desist from their purpose of invading Judah for any denunciations of the prophets; on the contrary, they had boasted proudly, that, strengthened as they were by their present alliance with the king of Syria, though they had heretofore suffered great loss, they had no doubt of repairing their fortune. Though <span class="ital">the bricks were fallen</span> <span class="ital">down, they would build with hewn stones, </span>&c. — The expression is metaphorically elegant, and denotes the restoration of a fallen state for the better, and the change of a mean and low to a more honourable and excellent situation. For their pride and arrogance, the God who laugheth vain men to scorn, denounces their punishment in the two following verses; and, according to his usual justice, assures them that the union with Rezin, wherein they boasted, should itself prove their destruction. This prophecy was fulfilled by Tiglath-pileser. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-17.htm" title="And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it, and put it on the pavement of stones.">2 Kings 16:17</a>, Vitringa, and Dodd. Dr. Waterland renders the beginning of the twelfth verse, “The Syrians from the east, and the Philistines from the west.” Though Rezin, king of Syria, was destroyed, yet the body of the nation survived, and submitted themselves to the king of Assyria, and upon his command invaded Israel afterward. <span class="ital">And they shall devour Israel, </span>&c. — Like wild beasts.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:8-21 Those are ripening apace for ruin, whose hearts are unhumbled under humbling providences. For that which God designs, in smiting us, is, to turn us to himself; and if this point be not gained by lesser judgments, greater may be expected. The leaders of the people misled them. We have reason to be afraid of those that speak well of us, when we do ill. Wickedness was universal, all were infected with it. They shall be in trouble, and see no way out; and when men's ways displease the Lord, he makes even their friends to be at war with them. God would take away those they thought to have help from. Their rulers were the head. Their false prophets were the tail and the rush, the most despicable. In these civil contests, men preyed on near relations who were as their own flesh. The people turn not to Him who smites them, therefore he continues to smite: for when God judges, he will overcome; and the proudest, stoutest sinner shall either bend or break.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord sent - Not Yahweh here, but "Adonai." It is apparent that this verse is the commencement of a new prophecy, that is not connected with that which precedes it. The strain of the preceding prophecy had respect to Judah; this is confined solely to Israel, or Ephraim. Here the division of the chapter should have been made, and should not have been again interrupted until <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-4.htm">Isaiah 10:4</a>, where the prophecy closes. The prophecy is divided into four parts, and each part is designed to threaten a distinct judgment on some particular, prominent vice.<p>I.

The prophet, having comforted Judah with the promise of the Messiah, returns to denounce the judgments of God upon the ten tribes, under the names of Jacob and Israel, which signify the same; for the "word" here is not the word of promise, the comfortable word concerning the Messiah before mentioned; but a word of threatening, ruin, and destruction, to the kingdom of Israel, after enlarged upon, which the Lord sent unto them by his prophets before hand, to warn them of it, and bring them to repentance; by which they would know, when it came to pass, that their destruction was of the Lord, and not a matter of chance: the Septuagint version is, "the Lord sent death upon Jacob"; and so the Arabic version, following it; the same word, differently pointed, being used for the pestilence, but is not the sense here; the Targum, Syriac, and Vulgate Latin versions, render it, "a word", as we do: <p>and it hath lighted upon Israel, or "hath fallen" (x); as an arrow shot out of a bow, as some think; or as seed cast upon the earth; or rather like a thunderbolt: it denotes the sure and full accomplishment of the word of God upon the persons to whom it was sent; for as his word of promise, so of threatening, does not return to him void and empty, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10</a>.

It is the most artistically arranged of all Isaiah’s writings, being divided into regular strophes as follows:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(i) Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/9-8.htm" title="The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it has lighted on Israel....">Isaiah 9:8-12</a>. The introduction (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/9-8.htm" title="The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it has lighted on Israel....">Isaiah 9:8-10</a></span>) explains that the oracle concerns the inhabitants of Samaria, and points to the buoyant assurance and self-confidence which was the habitual temper of the Northern Kingdom. The prophet then enters on a review of the various calamities by which Jehovah had sought to bring the nation to repentance, the first of these being the aggressions of its powerful neighbours on the East and the West (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/9-11.htm" title="Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together;...">Isaiah 9:11-12</a></span>). This was the first stroke of Jehovah’s hand.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(ii) <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/9-13.htm" title="For the people turns not to him that smites them, neither do they seek the LORD of hosts....">Isaiah 9:13-17</a></span>. A second blow descends on the impenitent nation in some sudden disaster by which the state is bereft of its leaders, great and small (13–16); the condition of the people is then seen to be utterly corrupt, so that Jehovah withdraws His compassion even from the helpless widows and orphans (17).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(iii) <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/9-18.htm" title="For wickedness burns as the fire: it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke....">Isaiah 9:18-21</a></span>. The third visitation is a state of anarchy and internecine strife, which is described mainly in a succession of powerful and telling images. The nation is rent by the conflict of rival factions, the only bond of unity being a common hatred of Judah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(iv) Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/10-1.htm" title="Woe to them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness which they have prescribed;...">Isaiah 10:1-4</a>. The fourth strophe opens with a “Woe” on the maladministration of the judges, which was always to Isaiah’s mind the chief symptom of a rotten republic (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/9-1.htm" title="Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations....">Isaiah 9:1-2</a></span>). This is followed by an allusion to a day of slaughter in which the magnates shall vainly seek safety beneath the slain (3, 4).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[It is possible that another strophe originally stood here, the closing words of which are preserved in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-25.htm" title="Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he has stretched forth his hand against them, and has smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcasses were torn in the middle of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.">Isaiah 5:25</a>.]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(v) Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/5-26.htm" title="And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss to them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:...">Isaiah 5:26-30</a>. The prediction of the Assyrian invasion forms, as has been already explained, the <span class="ital">dénouement</span> of this great drama of judgment. (For the exegesis, see on the passage above, pp. 40–42.) The refrain is of course dropped; Jehovah’s wrath is stayed, His hand is no longer stretched forth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is assumed in the foregoing analysis that the passage is in the main (down at least to the end of ch. 9) a <span class="ital">retrospect</span> of historical judgments; and this is the view naturally suggested by the tenses of the original, which are with few exceptions perfects, or the equivalents of perfects. A majority of commentators, however, taking the perfects as those of prophetic certainty, interpret the oracle as an ideal delineation of the stages of a judgment yet to come. And it is no doubt conceivable that the prophet might assume an ideal standpoint on the eve of the Assyrian invasion, regarding the preliminary chastisements as past, although they were in reality still future at the time of writing. But such a lavish and continuous use of the prophetic perfect would be unparalleled; and the change to the impf. at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-26.htm" title="And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss to them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:">Isaiah 5:26</a> seems too significant to be explained on this hypothesis. It is, therefore, on the whole safer to assume that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/9-8.htm" title="The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it has lighted on Israel....">Isaiah 9:8-21</a> the references are to past events, although it may not be possible in every case to specify the exact circumstances that are meant. A shorter oracle arranged on the principle here supposed is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/4-6.htm" title="And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have you not returned to me, said the LORD....">Amos 4:6-12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The date of the prophecy is not easily determined. The most probable view is that it was composed just before the outbreak of the Syro-Ephraimitish war. A later date (though not perhaps impossible) is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the issues of that expedition, so disastrous to the Northern Kingdom, are not mentioned. The Assyrians, moreover, are described in terms so vaguely poetic as to suggest that they were as yet unknown to the Israelites at close quarters. Syria also is mentioned as the enemy of Israel, without any hint of an alliance between them; while it is thought by some that <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-21.htm" title="Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.">Isaiah 9:21</a></span> alludes to the incipient antagonism towards Judah which afterwards found vent in the invasion. None of these indications are very decisive, but there are none to neutralise them (see, however, on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/9-10.htm" title="The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the sycomores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars....">Isaiah 9:10-11</a></span> below); and the passage may at least be regarded provisionally as a product of the earliest period of Isaiah’s ministry.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-21.</span> - THE PROPHET RETURNS TO THREATS AND WARNINGS, ADDRESSED CHIEFLY TO THE KINGDOM OF ISRAEL. The remainder of this chapter, together with the first four verses of the next, seems to have formed originally a distinct and separate prophecy. The passage is a poem in four stanzas, with the same refrain at the end of each: "For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still." A somewhat early date has been assigned to the prophecy, as; for instance, "some period in the reign of Jotham" (Cheyne); but the internal evidence only proves that it was written before the destruction of Samaria by the Assyrians. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jacob... Israel.</span> These words do not show that the prophecy is directed against the kingdom of Israel only. "Jacob" designates Judah rather than Israel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3, 5, 6</a>; and the expression, "both the houses of Israel," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a>, shows that the term "Israel" embraces both kingdoms. Tim distinctive names by which Isaiah ordinarily designates the northern kingdom are "Ephraim" and "Samaria." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The range of vision is first widened in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>.: "The people that walk about in darkness see a great light; they who dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them a light shines." The range of vision is here extended; not to the Gentiles, however, but to all Israel. Salvation would not break forth till it had become utterly dark along the horizon of Israel, according to the description in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-30.htm">Isaiah 5:30</a>, i.e., till the land of Jehovah had become a land of the shadow of death on account of the apostasy of its inhabitants from Jehovah (zalma&#770;veth is modified, after the manner of a composite noun, from zalmu&#772;th, according to the form kadru&#772;th, and is derived from &#1510;&#1500;&#1501;, Aeth. salema, Arab. zalima, to be dark).<p>(Note: The shadow or shade, ze&#772;l, Arab. zill (radically related to tall  equals  &#1496;&#1500;, dew), derived its name ab obtegendo, and according to the idea attached to it as the opposite of heat or of light, was used as a figure of a beneficent shelter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-3.htm">Isaiah 16:3</a>), or of what was dark and horrible (cf., Targ. talla&#770;ni, a night-demon). The verb za&#770;lam, in the sense of the Arabic zalima, bears the same relation to za&#770;lal as ba&#770;ham to ba&#770;ha&#770;h (Gen. p. 93), &#8219;a&#770;ram, to be naked, to &#8219;a&#770;ra&#770;h (Jeshurun, p. 159). The noun zelem, however, is either formed from this za&#770;lam, or else directly from ze&#772;l, with the substantive termination em.)<p>The apostate mass of the nation is to be regarded as already swept away; for if death has cast its shadow over the land, it must be utterly desolate. In this state of things the remnant left in the land beholds a great light, which breaks through the sky that has been hitherto covered with blackness. The people, who turned their eyes upwards to no purpose, because they did so with cursing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-21.htm">Isaiah 8:21</a>), are now no more. It is the remnant of Israel which sees this light of spiritual and material redemption arise above its head. In what this light would consist the prophet states afterwards, when describing first the blessings and then the star of the new time. </body></html>
