Those that want the gospel, walk in darkness, and in the utmost danger. But when the gospel comes to any place, to any soul, light comes. Let us earnestly pray that it may shine into our hearts, and make us wise unto salvation. The gospel brings joy with it. Those who would have joy, must expect to go through hard work, as the husbandman, before he has the joy of harvest; and hard conflict, as the soldier, before he divides the spoil. The Jews were delivered from the yoke of many oppressors; this was a shadow of the believer's deliverance from the yoke of Satan. The cleansing the souls of believers from the power and pollution of sin, would be by the influence of the Holy Spirit, as purifying fire. These great things for the church, shall be done by the Messiah, Emmanuel. The Child is born; it was certain; and the church, before Christ came in the flesh, benefitted by his undertaking. It is a prophecy of him and of his kingdom, which those that waited for the Consolation of Israel read with pleasure. This Child was born for the benefit of us men, of us sinners, of all believers, from the beginning to the end of the world. Justly is he called Wonderful, for he is both God and man. His love is the wonder of angels and glorified saints. He is the Counsellor, for he knew the counsels of God from eternity; and he gives counsel to men, in which he consults our welfare. He is the Wonderful Counsellor; none teaches like him. He is God, the mighty One. Such is the work of the Mediator, that no less power than that of the mighty God could bring it to pass. He is God, one with the Father. As the Prince of Peace, he reconciles us to God; he is the Giver of peace in the heart and conscience; and when his kingdom is fully established, men shall learn war no more. The government shall be upon him; he shall bear the burden of it. Glorious things are spoken of Christ's government. There is no end to the increase of its peace, for the happiness of its subjects shall last for ever. The exact agreement of this prophecy with the doctrine of the New Testament, shows that Jewish prophets and Christian teachers had the same view of the person and salvation of the Messiah. To what earthly king or kingdom can these words apply? Give then, O Lord, to thy people to know thee by every endearing name, and in every glorious character. Give increase of grace in every heart of thy redeemed upon earth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou hast multiplied the nation - Thou hast rendered the nation strong, powerful, mighty. Several interpreters, as Calvin, Vitringa, and Le Clerc, suppose that the prophet here, and in the two following verses, speaks in the first instance of the prosperity near at hand, and of the rapid increase of the Israelites after the return from the Babylonian exile, in which the inhabitants of Galilee must have participated, as may be inferred from the accounts of Josephus respecting the great population of that province in his time; see Jewish Wars, i. 20, 23. Vitringa also directs our attention to the fact, that the Jewish people, after the exile, not only filled Judea, but spread themselves into Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy. But there seems to be no necessity for referring it to such an increase of the inhabitants. It may refer to the great increase of the Messiah's kingdom, or of the kingdom which he would set up, and whose commencement would be in Galilee; see Hengstenberg, Christol., vol. i. p. 354.<p>And not increased the joy - The Masoretes here read in the margin &#1500;&#1493;  lo&#770; "to it," instead of &#1500;&#1488;  lo' "not." Eleven manuscripts, two of them ancient, have this reading. This reading is followed by the Chaldee Paraphrase, the Syriac, and the Arabic. The Septuagint seems also to have so understood it. So also it is in the margin, and so the connection demands; and it is unquestionably the correct reading. It would then read, 'thou hast increased for it (the nation) the joy.' Hengstenberg, however, suggests that the phrase may mean, 'whose joy thou didst not before enlarge,' that is, upon whom thou hast before inflicted heavy sufferings. But this is harsh, and I see no reason to doubt that an error may have crept into the text.<p>They joy before thee according to the joy of harvest - This is a beautiful figure; and is found frequently in ancient writings. The harvest was a time of exultation and joy, and was commonly gathered amid songs and rejoicings, and concluded with a festival. The phrase 'before thee' refers to the fact that the first-fruits of the harvest among the Hebrews were presented with thanksgiving before God in the temple; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-7.htm">Deuteronomy 12:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-22.htm">Deuteronomy 14:22-26</a>.<p>And as men rejoice ... - This is also an expression of great joy and rejoicing. Such an occasion, at the close of a battle, when great spoil or plunder had been taken, would be one of great rejoicing; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-30.htm">Judges 5:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-16.htm">1 Samuel 30:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-25.htm">2 Chronicles 20:25-28</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. multiplied &#8230; nation&#8212;primarily, the rapid increase of Israelites after the return from Babylon; more fully and exhaustively the rapid spread of Christianity at first.<p>not increased the joy&#8212;By a slight change in the Hebrew, its (joy) is substituted by some for not, because "not increased the joy" seems opposite to what immediately follows, "the joy," &c. Hengstenberg, retains not thus: "Whose joy thou hadst not increased," (that is, hadst diminished). Others, "Hast thou not increased the joy?" The very difficulty of the reading, not, makes it less likely to be an interpolation. Horsley best explains it: The prophet sees in vision a shifting scene, comprehending at one glance the history of the Christian Church to remotest times&#8212;a land dark and thinly peopled&#8212;lit up by a sudden light&#8212;filled with new inhabitants&#8212;then struggling with difficulties, and again delivered by the utter and final overthrow of their enemies. The influx of Gentile converts (represented here by "Galilee of the Gentiles") soon was to be followed by the growth of corruption, and the final rise of Antichrist, who is to be destroyed, while God's people is delivered, as in the case of Gideon's victory over Midian, not by man's prowess, but by the special interposition of God.<p>before thee&#8212;a phrase taken from sacrificial feasts; the tithe of harvest was eaten before God (De 12:7; 14:26).<p>as men rejoice &#8230; divide &#8230; spoil&#8212;referring to the judgments on the enemies of the Lord and His people, which usually accompany revelations of His grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou hast multiplied the nation; </span> thou hast made good thy promise to Abraham concerning the multiplication of his seed, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-5.htm" title="And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if you be able to number them: and he said to him, So shall your seed be.">Genesis 15:5</a> 22:17</span>, by adding his spiritual seed unto the carnal, by gathering in the Gentiles to the Jews, and making them both one people in Christ, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-16.htm" title="And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.">John 10:16</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14</a></span>, &c.

With light, knowledge, honour, and glory, even Galilee of the nations before mentioned, the land of darkness, and of the shadow of death, where the people dwelt; on whom Christ, the light, shone in the ministration of his Gospel to them; whereby the number of believers in Christ were multiplied; and indeed, as he conversed, preached, and wrought his miracles most here, he had here the greatest number of disciples and followers; here were the five hundred brethren by whom he was seen at once, after his resurrection, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a> for this is not to be understood of the Assyrian nation, whose army under Sennacherib was very large; nor of the Jewish nation enlarged by the destruction of that army, or of their increase after their return from the Babylonish captivity; nor of the church of God by the accession of Gentiles to it; but of the land or nation before spoken of: <p>and not increased the joy; or rather, as it should be rendered, "and hast increased joy unto it"; following the Keri; or marginal reading, which directs that it should be read, not as a negative, "not", but  "to it"; and which is followed by the Targum and Syriac version, and by Jarchi, Aben Ezra, and Kimchi, and others; and the sense of the words requires this reading, since it follows, <p>they joy before thee; or otherwise there would be a manifest contradiction in the text; though some, to avoid it, read the words interrogatively, "hast thou not increased the joy?" thou hast; and in this way both the Keri and the Cetib, the reading and the writing, may be taken in, "hast thou not increased joy unto it?" and so as Gussetius (i) renders it, <p>"thou hast multiplied the nation to whom thou hadst not given great joy:'' <p>that is, temporal joy; though now much of that which is of a spiritual kind: Christ the light appearing, his Gospel being preached by him, and his apostles, and many believing in him, occasioned an increase of spiritual joy in those parts; and so it is, that wherever the Gospel comes, and Christ is preached, and souls are converted, there is great joy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-6.htm">Acts 8:6</a> where there is any grace of the Spirit, as faith, hope, and love, there is joy; and particularly when a soul is enlightened and quickened, as in the preceding verse <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>, it rejoices, reflecting on the state of darkness and death it is brought out of, and on the marvellous light, life, and liberty it is brought into; and at a sight of Christ, his person, offices, relations, and grace, as the sun of righteousness, with healing in his wings, and beaming light, salvation, and happiness; which joy is spiritual, internal, passes knowledge, is imperfect, but capable of being increased: <p>they joy before thee; the words, both in this and in the preceding clauses, are addressed to God, and show, that as the work of conversion, and an increase of spiritual joy, are from him; so that joy that is given by hint is expressed "before" him, in his house and ordinances, and it is in his sight, before whom all things are manifest; and so it denotes the truth and sincerity of it, which is illustrated by the following metaphors: <p>according to the joy in harvest; such as is expressed by men in harvest time, both by the rich owners and proprietors, when they have a good harvest, and well got in, and by the poor, who have a prospect of a comfortable supply in a cheap manner; and this simile is used with great propriety and pertinence. Christ and his ministers are sowers of seed, of the word; and hearers of the word are compared to seed sown in different places; and when any number of these are converted, it is a harvest which occasions joy. The Targum is, <p>"as the joy of conquerors in war;'' <p>which agrees with what follows: <p>and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil; taken in war: in redemption, Christ has taken the prey from the mighty, and delivered the lawful captive, and has divided the spoil with the strong; and in effectual calling binds the strong man armed, and spoils his goods, and delivers souls out of his hands, and this is matter of great joy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a> see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-162.htm">Psalm 119:162</a>. <p>(i) Ebr.

Almost all other recent commentators accept the solution offered by the Masoretic reading (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span>), which makes the passage simple and easy: "Thou hast multiplied the nation; its joy thou hast increased; they joy before thee," etc. (So many Hebrew manuscripts, the Alexandrine Septuagint, the Syriac, Gesenius, Knobel, Cheyne, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">According to the joy in harvest.</span> "The joy in harvest" was to the Jews the joy of the Feast of Tabernacles, or in gathering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>), held when the last fruits were brought in. But the prophet is perhaps taking a wider view, and thinking of the many harvest festivals prevailing throughout Western Asia, all of them originating in gratitude to the Giver of all good, and many of them comprising manifestations of joy more jubilant than those habitual to his sedater countrymen. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>It is to this ecclesiola in ecclesia that the prophet's admonition is addressed.

The persons into whose mouths the answer is put by the prophet (we may supply before <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19</a>, "Thus shall ye say to them;" cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-11.htm">Jeremiah 10:11</a>), are his own children and disciples. The circumstances of the times were very critical; and the people were applying to wizards to throw light upon the dark future. 'Ob signified primarily the spirit of witchcraft, then the possessor of such a spirit (equivalent to Baal ob), more especially the necromancer. Yidd&#8219;oni, on the other hand, signified primarily the possessor of a prophesying or soothsaying spirit (&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; or &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), Syr. yodu&#772;a&#8219; (after the intensive from pa&#770;&#8219;ul with immutable vowels), and then the soothsaying spirit itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-27.htm">Leviticus 20:27</a>), which was properly called yidda&#770;'o&#772;n (the much knowing), like &#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, which, according to Plato, is equivalent to &#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;. These people, who are designated by the lxx, both here and elsewhere, as &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, i.e., ventriloquists, imitated the chirping of bats, which was supposed to proceed from the shadows of Hades, and uttered their magical formulas in a whispering tone.<p>(Note: The Mishnah Sanhedrin 65a gives this definition: "Baal'ob is a python, i.e., a soothsayer ('with a spirit of divination'), who speaks from his arm-pit; yidd&#8219;oni, a man who speaks with his mouth." The baal ob, so far as he had to do with the bones of the dead, is called in the Talmud oba&#770; temayya', e.g., the witch of Endor (b. Sabbath 152b). On the history of the etymological explanation of the word, see Bttcher, de inferis, 205-217. If 'ob, a skin or leather bottle, is a word from the same root (rendered "bellows" by the lxx at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-19.htm">Job 32:19</a>), as it apparently is, it may be applied to a bottle as a thing which swells or can be blown out, and to a wizard of spirit of incantation on account of this puffing and gasping. The explanation "le revenant," from &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;  equals  Arab. a&#770;ba, to return, has only a very weak support in the proper name &#1488;&#1497;&#1493;&#1489;  equals  avva&#770;b (the penitent, returning again and again to God: see again at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-4.htm">Isaiah 29:4</a>).)<p>What an unnatural thing, for the people of Jehovah to go and inquire, not of their won God, but of such heathenish and demoniacal deceivers and victims as these (da&#770;rash 'el, to go and inquire of a person, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a>, synonymous with sha&#770;'ar b', <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a>)! What blindness, to consult the dead in the interests of the living! By "the dead" (hamme&#772;thim) we are not to understand "the idols" in this passage, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-28.htm">Psalm 106:28</a>, but the departed, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-11.htm">Deuteronomy 18:11</a> (cf., <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28.htm">1 Samuel 28</a>) clearly proves; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491; is not to be taken, either here or elsewhere, as equivalent to tachath ("instead of"), as Knobel supposes, but, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-2.htm">Jeremiah 21:2</a> and other passages, as signifying "for the benefit of." Necromancy, which makes the dead the instructors of the living, is a most gloomy deception. </body></html>
