Now, as the yokes which they had been under were emblematical of those of Satan, sin, and death, the spiritual enemies of God’s people, so their deliverances were figures of the spiritual deliverance which believers, whether Jews or Gentiles, receive through Christ. And of this spiritual deliverance and salvation, as the context shows, this verse is to be understood. For the preceding verses foretel the diffusion of gospel light, and those that follow attest the birth of the Messiah, unfold his characters and offices, and set forth the blessings of his peaceful and righteous reign. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm" title="In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.">Jeremiah 23:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/1-70.htm" title="As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:...">Luke 1:70-74</a>, where Zacharias, full of the Holy Ghost, seems most admirably to expound this passage of the prophet. <span class="ital">As in the day of Midian </span>— When God destroyed the Midianites in so admirable a manner, and by such unlikely and contemptible means, which was an eminent type of Christ’s conquering the powers of darkness, and all his enemies, by dying on the cross, and by the preaching of a few unlearned, and poor, despised men.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-7 The Syrians and Assyrians first ravaged the countries here mentioned, and that region was first favoured by the preaching of Christ. Those that want the gospel, walk in darkness, and in the utmost danger. But when the gospel comes to any place, to any soul, light comes. Let us earnestly pray that it may shine into our hearts, and make us wise unto salvation. The gospel brings joy with it. Those who would have joy, must expect to go through hard work, as the husbandman, before he has the joy of harvest; and hard conflict, as the soldier, before he divides the spoil. The Jews were delivered from the yoke of many oppressors; this was a shadow of the believer's deliverance from the yoke of Satan. The cleansing the souls of believers from the power and pollution of sin, would be by the influence of the Holy Spirit, as purifying fire. These great things for the church, shall be done by the Messiah, Emmanuel. The Child is born; it was certain; and the church, before Christ came in the flesh, benefitted by his undertaking. It is a prophecy of him and of his kingdom, which those that waited for the Consolation of Israel read with pleasure. This Child was born for the benefit of us men, of us sinners, of all believers, from the beginning to the end of the world. Justly is he called Wonderful, for he is both God and man. His love is the wonder of angels and glorified saints. He is the Counsellor, for he knew the counsels of God from eternity; and he gives counsel to men, in which he consults our welfare. He is the Wonderful Counsellor; none teaches like him. He is God, the mighty One. Such is the work of the Mediator, that no less power than that of the mighty God could bring it to pass. He is God, one with the Father. As the Prince of Peace, he reconciles us to God; he is the Giver of peace in the heart and conscience; and when his kingdom is fully established, men shall learn war no more. The government shall be upon him; he shall bear the burden of it. Glorious things are spoken of Christ's government. There is no end to the increase of its peace, for the happiness of its subjects shall last for ever. The exact agreement of this prophecy with the doctrine of the New Testament, shows that Jewish prophets and Christian teachers had the same view of the person and salvation of the Messiah. To what earthly king or kingdom can these words apply? Give then, O Lord, to thy people to know thee by every endearing name, and in every glorious character. Give increase of grace in every heart of thy redeemed upon earth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For thou hast broken - This verse, and the following, show the way in which the occasion of the joy had been furnished. The expression 'thou hast' does not necessarily refer to the past, but is a form of expression derived from the nature of the prophetic visions, where that is described as past which is seen to pass before the eyes of the prophet; see the Introduction, section 7.<p>The yoke - This word is often used to denote oppression, or tyranny; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-13.htm">Leviticus 26:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-48.htm">Deuteronomy 28:48</a> - where oppression is described as 'an iron yoke;' compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-6.htm">Isaiah 47:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6</a>.<p>The staff of his shoulder - The word rendered staff here may mean a bough, a branch, a staff, stick, or rod. Gesenius supposes that the expression here means the rod by which punishment is inflicted, and that the, phrase 'rod of, or for the shoulder,' denotes oppression and servitude. Rosenmuller thinks, that it refers rather to the custom among the ancients of placing a piece of wood, not unlike a yoke, on the necks and shoulders of slaves, as a mark of servitude. Hengstenberg understands it, 'the staff which strikes the neck or back.'<p>The rod of his oppressor - This, doubtless, refers to the chastisement which was inflicted on those in bondage, and is a phrase denoting oppression and servitude. The word 'his' here refers to Israel.<p>As in the day of Midian - This refers to the deliverance that was accomplished under Gideon against the Midianites; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>; 8. That deliverance was a remarkable interposition of God. It was accomplished not by human strength; but was a signal manifestation of the power of God in delivering the nation from the long oppression of the Midianites. So the prophet says here, that the deliverance will be as signal a proof of the presence and power of God as is was in that day. Herder (Hebrew Poetry, vol. ii. p. 296) says, 'At that period, in the north part of the country, a great deliverance was wrought. Then, in the obscure forests of Naphtali and Zebulun, the light of freedom went forth over all the land. So now, also, in this northern press of nations, in the way along the sea of Galilee, where now the hostile Syrians are exercising their oppressions, the light of freedom is going forth, and there shall be joy and jubilee, like that of the song of Deborah.' <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. The occasion of the "joy," the deliverance not only of Ahaz and Judah from the Assyrian tribute (2Ki 16:8), and of Israel's ten tribes from the oppressor (2Ki 15:19), but of the Jewish Christian Church from its last great enemy.<p>hast&#8212;the past time for the future, in prophetic vision; it expresses the certainty of the event.<p>yoke of his burden&#8212;the yoke with which he was burdened.<p>staff of &#8230; shoulder&#8212;the staff which strikes his shoulder [Maurer]; or the wood, like a yoke, on the neck of slaves, the badge of servitude [Rosenmuller].<p>day of Midian&#8212;(Jud 7:8-22). As Gideon with a handful of men conquered the hosts of Midian, so Messiah the "child" (Isa 9:6) shall prove to be the "Prince of peace," and the small Israel under Him shall overcome the mighty hosts of Antichrist (compare Mic 5:2-5), containing the same contrast, and alluding also to "the Assyrian," the then enemy of the Church, as here in Isaiah, the type of the last great enemy. For further analogies between Gideon's victory and the Gospel, compare 2Co 4:7, with Jud 7:22. As the "dividing of the spoil" (Isa 9:3) was followed by that which was "not joy," the making of the idolatrous ephod (Jud 8:24-27), so the gospel victory was soon followed by apostasy at the first, and shall be so again after the millennial overthrow of Antichrist (Re 20:3, 7-9), previous to Satan's last doom (Re 20:10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou hast broken:</span> this notes the matter and occasion of the foregoing joy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The yoke of his burden; </span> his burdensome and heavy yoke, as <span class="ital">the throne of holiness</span> is put for <span class="ital">the holy throne</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/47-8.htm" title="God reigns over the heathen: God sits on the throne of his holiness.">Psalm 47:8</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The staff of his shoulder; </span> either the staff wherewith his shoulders were smitten, or the staff or staves by which he was forced to carry burdens upon his shoulders. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The rod, </span> wherewith he beat him.

Not, however, in an earthly sense, since the Messiah's kingdom was not of this world. The "yoke" is that of sin, the "oppressor" is that prince of darkness, who had well-nigh brought all mankind under his dominion when Christ came. <span class="cmt_word">His oppressor</span>; literally, <span class="accented">his task-master -</span> the same word which is used of the Egyptian taskmasters in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">As in the day of Midian.</span> The "day of Midian" is probably the time of Israel's deliverance from the Midianite oppression by Gideon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-19.htm">Judges 7:19-25</a>). The special characteristic of the deliverance was, as Dr. Kay well observes, "that it was accomplished without military prowess by a small body of men selected out of Israel, selected expressly in order that Israel might not vaunt itself against the Lord, saying, My own hand hath saved me (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2</a>)." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In opposition to such a falling away to wretched superstition, the watchword of the prophet and his supporters is this. "To the teaching of God (thorah, Gotteslehre), and to the testimony! If they do not accord with this word, they are a people for whom no morning dawns." The summons, "to the teaching and to the testimony" (namely, to those which Jehovah gave through His prophet, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-17.htm">Isaiah 8:17</a>), takes the form of a watchword in time of battle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-18.htm">Judges 7:18</a>). With this construction the following &#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1500;&#1488; (which Knobel understands interrogatively, "Should not they speak so, who, etc.?" and Luzzatto as an oath, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/131-2.htm">Psalm 131:2</a>, "Surely they say such words as have no dawn in them") has, at any rate, all the presumption of a conditional signification. Whoever had not this watchword would be regarded as the enemy of Jehovah, and suffer the fate of such a man. This is, to all appearance, the meaning of the apodosis &#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1512; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;&#1470;&#1500;&#1493; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;. Luther has given the meaning correctly, "If they do not say this, they will not have the morning dawn;" or, according to his earlier and equally good rendering, "They shall never overtake the morning light," literally, "They are those to whom no dawn arises." The use of the plural in the hypothetical protasis, and the singular in the apodosis, is an intentional and significant change. All the several individuals who did not adhere to the revelation made by Jehovah through His prophet, formed one corrupt mass, which would remain in hopeless darkness. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is used in the same sense as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-28.htm">Isaiah 5:28</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>, and possibly also as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-20.htm">1 Samuel 15:20</a>, instead of the more usual &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, when used in the affirmative sense which springs in both particles out of the confirmative (namque and quoniam): Truly they have no morning dawn to expect.<p>(Note: Strangely enough, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-20.htm">Isaiah 8:20</a> are described in Lev. Rabba, ch. xv, as words of the prophet Hosea incorporated in the book of Isaiah.) </body></html>
