Whatever injury Samaria had sustained (the words are too proverbially figurative to make literal interpretation probable), through the intervention of Tiglath-pileser, was, its rulers thought, but as the prelude to a great and more lasting victory even than that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-6.htm" title="For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.">2Chronicles 28:6</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:8-21 Those are ripening apace for ruin, whose hearts are unhumbled under humbling providences. For that which God designs, in smiting us, is, to turn us to himself; and if this point be not gained by lesser judgments, greater may be expected. The leaders of the people misled them. We have reason to be afraid of those that speak well of us, when we do ill. Wickedness was universal, all were infected with it. They shall be in trouble, and see no way out; and when men's ways displease the Lord, he makes even their friends to be at war with them. God would take away those they thought to have help from. Their rulers were the head. Their false prophets were the tail and the rush, the most despicable. In these civil contests, men preyed on near relations who were as their own flesh. The people turn not to Him who smites them, therefore he continues to smite: for when God judges, he will overcome; and the proudest, stoutest sinner shall either bend or break.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The bricks are fallen down - The language of this verse is figurative; but the sentiment is plain. It contains the confession of the inhabitants of Samaria, that their affairs were in a ruinous and dilapidated state; but also their self-confident assurance that they would be able to repair the evils, and restore their nation to more than their former magnificence.<p>Bricks, in oriental countries, were made of clay and straw, and were rarely turned. Hence, exposed to suns and rains, they soon dissolved. Walls and houses constructed of such materials would not be very permanent, and to build with them is strongly contrasted with building in a permanent and elegant manner with hewn stone.<p>The meaning is, that their former state was one of less splendor than they designed that their subsequent state should be. Desolation had come in upon their country, and this they could not deny. But they confidently boasted that they would more than repair the evil.<p>We will build - Our ruined houses and walls.<p>With hewn stones - At once more permanent and elegant than the structures of bricks had been.<p>The sycamores - These trees grew abundantly on the low lands of Judea, and were very little esteemed; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-27.htm">1 Kings 10:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-15.htm">2 Chronicles 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-27.htm">2 Chronicles 9:27</a>.<p>'This curious tree seems to partake of the nature of two different species,' says Calmet, 'the mulberry and the fig; the former in its leaf, and the latter in its fruit. Its Greek name, &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  sukomoros, is plainly descriptive of its character, being compounded of &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  sukos, a fig tree, and &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  moros, a mulberry tree. It is thus described by Norden: "They have in Egypt divers sorts of figs; but if there is any difference between them, a particular kind differs still more. I mean that which the sycamore bears, that they name in Arabic giomez. This sycamore is of the height of a beech, and bears its fruit in a manner quite different from other trees. It has them on the trunk itself, which shoots out little sprigs in form of a grapestalk, at the end of which grows the fruit close to one another, most like bunches of grapes. The tree is always green, and bears fruit several times in the year, without observing any certain seasons, for I have seen some sycamores which had fruit two months after others. This sort of tree is pretty common in Egypt."' They were not highly valued, though it is probable they were often employed in building.<p>They are contrasted with cedars here - <p>(1) Because the cedar was a much more rare and precious wood.<p>(2) Because it was a much more smooth and elegant article of building.<p>(3) Because it was more permanent. The grain and texture of the sycamore is remarkably coarse and spongy, and could, therefore, stand in no competition with the cedar for beauty and ornament.<p>We will change them - We will employ in their stead.<p>Cedars - The cedar was a remarkably fine; elegant, and permanent wood for building. It was principally obtained on mount Lebanon, and was employed in temples, palaces, and in the houses of the rich; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-18.htm">Isaiah 2:18</a>.<p>The sycamore is contrasted with the cedar in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-27.htm">1 Kings 10:27</a> : 'Cedars he made to be as sycamore trees.' The whole passage denotes self-confidence and pride; an unwillingness to submit to the judgments of God, and a self-assurance that they would more than repair all the evils that would be inflicted on them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. bricks&#8212;in the East generally sun-dried, and therefore soon dissolved by rain.

Jarchi interprets the bricks and sycamores of the kings that went before, as Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, in whose days they were lessened, and were like a building of brick, broken and falling; but their present king, Pekah, the son of Remaliah, was strong, like a building of hewn stone, and so cedars were better for building than sycamores; and to this sense agrees the Targum, <p>"the heads (or princes) are carried captive, but we will appoint better in their room; goods are spoiled, but what are more beautiful than them we will purchase.'' <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> bricks have fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the sycamores are cut down, but we will change <i>them into</i> cedars.</span><p>(n) We were but weak, when the enemy overcame us, but we will make ourselves so strong, that we will neither care for our enemies, nor fear God's threatenings.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>.

The suffixes refer to the people (ha&#770;e&#772;a&#770;m).

The future deliverance, which the prophet here celebrates, would be the counterpart of the Egyptian. But as the whole of the great nation of Israel was then redeemed, whereas only a small remnant would participate in the final redemption, he compares it to the day of Midian, when Gideon broke the seven years' dominion of Midian, not with a great army, but with a handful of resolute warriors, strong in the Lord (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>). The question suggests itself here, Who is the hero, Gideon's antitype, through whom all this is to occur? The prophet does not say; but building up one clause upon another with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, he gives first of all the reason for the cessation of the oppressive dominion of the imperial power - namely, the destruction of all the military stores of the enemy. </body></html>
