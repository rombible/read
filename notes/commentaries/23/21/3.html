Then, indeed, was <span class="ital">the night of his pleasure turned into fear unto him, </span>in which remarkable words the prophet alludes to the circumstance of Babylon’s being taken in the night of an annual festival, “while the inhabitants were dancing, drinking, and revelling, which is more fully set forth in the next verse.” According to Herodotus, the extreme parts of the city were in the hands of the enemy, before they, who dwelt in the middle of it, knew any thing of their danger.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:1-10 Babylon was a flat country, abundantly watered. The destruction of Babylon, so often prophesied of by Isaiah, was typical of the destruction of the great foe of the New Testament church, foretold in the Revelation. To the poor oppressed captives it would be welcome news; to the proud oppressors it would be grievous. Let this check vain mirth and sensual pleasures, that we know not in what heaviness the mirth may end. Here is the alarm given to Babylon, when forced by Cyrus. An ass and a camel seem to be the symbols of the Medes and Persians. Babylon's idols shall be so far from protecting her, that they shall be broken down. True believers are the corn of God's floor; hypocrites are but as chaff and straw, with which the wheat is now mixed, but from which it shall be separated. The corn of God's floor must expect to be threshed by afflictions and persecutions. God's Israel of old was afflicted. Even then God owns it is his still. In all events concerning the church, past, present, and to come, we must look to God, who has power to do any thing for his church, and grace to do every thing that is for her good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore - In this verse, and the following, the prophet represents himself as "in" Babylon, and as a witness of the calamities which would come upon the city. He describes the sympathy which he feels in her sorrows, and represents himself as deeply affected by her calamities. A similar description occurred in the pain which the prophet represents himself as enduring on account of the calamities of Moab (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a>, note).<p>My loins - (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a>).<p>With pain - The word used here (&#1495;&#1500;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;  chalcha&#770;la&#770;h) denotes properly the pains of parturition, and the whole figure is taken from that. The sense is, that the prophet was filled with the most acute sorrow and anguish, in view of the calamities which were coming on Babylon. That is, the sufferings of Babylon would be indescribably great and dreadful (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-11.htm">Nahum 2:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-4.htm">Ezekiel 30:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-9.htm">Ezekiel 30:9</a>).<p>I was bowed down - Under the grief and sorrow produced by these calamities.<p>At the hearing it - The Hebrew may have this sense, and mean that these things were made to pass before the eye of the prophet, and that the sight oppressed him, and bowed him down. But more probably the Hebrew letter &#1502;  (m) in the word &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;  mishemoa' is to be taken "privatively," and means, 'I was so bowed down or oppressed that I could not see; I was so dismayed that I could not hear;' that is, all his senses were taken away by the greatness of the calamity, and by his sympathetic sufferings. A similar construction occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-23.htm">Psalm 69:23</a> : 'Let their eyes be darkened that they see not' (&#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;  me&#772;re'o&#770;th) that is, "from" seeing. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

As a woman at the time of childbirth, as the following words show: these words are spoken by the prophet, not with respect to himself, as if he was pained at heart at the prophecy and vision he had of the ruin of Babylon, since that was a mortal enemy of his people; and besides, their sighing being made to cease could never be a reason of distress in him, but of joy: these words are spoken by him in the person of the Babylonians, and particularly of Belshazzar their king: <p>pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth; which come suddenly and at once, are very sharp and strong, and inevitable, which cannot be escaped; so the sudden destruction of the wicked, and particularly of antichrist at the last day, and the terror that shall attend it, are expressed by the same metaphor, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>, <p>I was bowed down at the hearing of it; distorted and convulsed; not the prophet at the hearing of the prophecy, but Belshazzar, whom he personated, at hearing that Cyrus had entered the city, and was at the gates of his palace: <p>I was dismayed at the seeing of it; the handwriting upon the wall, at which his countenance changed, his thoughts were troubled, his loins loosed, and his knees smote one against another, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-6.htm">Daniel 5:6</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore are my <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing <i>of it</i>; I was dismayed at the seeing <i>of it</i>.</span><p>(f) This the prophet speaks in the person of the Babylonians.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">are my loins filled with pain</span>] <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-10.htm" title="She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melts, and the knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness.">Nahum 2:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I was bowed down at the hearing</span> …] or, as R.V. <span class="bld">I am pained so that I cannot hear</span>, &c.

The prophet is horrorstruck at the vision shown him - at the devastation, the ruin, the carnage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-18.htm">Isaiah 13:18</a>). He does not stop to consider how well deserved the punishment is; he does not, perhaps, as yet know how that, in smiting Babylon, God will be specially avenging the sufferings of his own nation (see the introductory paragraph). <span class="cmt_word">I was bowed down at the hearing</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">I am so agonized that I cannot hear</span>; <span class="accented">I am so terrified that I cannot see</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>It is not till Isaiah has carried out the divine instructions, that he learns the reason for this command to strip himself, and the length of time that he is to continue so stripped. "And Jehovah said, As my servant Yesha'yahu goeth naked and barefooted, a sign and type for three years long over Egypt and over Ethiopia, so will the king of Asshur carry away the prisoners of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia, children and old men, naked and barefooted, and with their seat uncovered - a shame to Egypt." The expression "as he goeth" (ca'asher ha&#770;lac) stands here at the commencement of the symbolical action, but it is introduced as if with a retrospective glance at its duration for three years, unless indeed the preterite ha&#770;lac stands here, as it frequently does, to express what has already commenced, and is still continuing and customary (compare, for example, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-4.htm">Job 1:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>). The strange and unseemly dress of the prophet, whenever he appeared in his official capacity for three whole years, was a prediction of the fall of the Egypto-Ethiopian kingdom, which was to take place at the end of these three years. Egypt and Ethiopia are as closely connected here as Israel and Judah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>. They were at that time one kingdom, so that the shame of Egypt was the shame of Ethiopia also. &#8219;Erva&#770;h is a shameful nakedness, and &#8219;ervath Mitzrayim is in apposition to all that precedes it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-4.htm">Isaiah 20:4</a>. She&#772;th is the seat or hinder part, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-4.htm">2 Samuel 10:4</a>, from sha&#770;tha&#770;h, to set or seat; it is a substantive form, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;, &#1506;&#1509;, &#1512;&#1506;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, with the third radical letter dropt. Chashu&#772;phay has the same ay as the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-9.htm">Isaiah 19:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-15.htm">Judges 5:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-14.htm">Jeremiah 22:14</a>, which can hardly be regarded as constructive forms, as Ewald, Knobel, and Gesenius suppose (although &#1470;&#1497; of the construct has arisen from &#1470;&#1497;), but rather as a singular form with a collective signification. The emendations suggested, viz., chasu&#772;phe&#772; by Olshausen, and chasu&#772;ph&#305;&#772; with a connecting i by Meier, are quite unnecessary. </body></html>
