The prophet may possibly mean a cavalry in two parts, with two sorts of riders; riders on asses, or mules, and riders on camels: or led on by two riders, one on an ass, and one on a camel.” Or, as some think, the verse may be rendered, <span class="ital">He saw a cavalcade, two file of horse, </span>(<span class="greekheb">צמד פרשׁים</span>,) <span class="ital">with ass-carriages, and carriages of camels; and he attended with very close attention. </span>According to this translation, the meaning is, that the watchman saw the army of the Medes and Persians, with their usual cavalcade of horse, (attended by those beasts of burden, asses and camels, which accompanied armies,) moving toward Babylon; upon which he gave the greatest attention possible. Or, according to the common reading, Darius and Cyrus, leading the Medes and Persians, are intended to be distinguished by the two riders, or the two sorts of cattle. The baggage of Cyrus’s army, Herodotus tells us, was carried on camels.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:1-10 Babylon was a flat country, abundantly watered. The destruction of Babylon, so often prophesied of by Isaiah, was typical of the destruction of the great foe of the New Testament church, foretold in the Revelation. To the poor oppressed captives it would be welcome news; to the proud oppressors it would be grievous. Let this check vain mirth and sensual pleasures, that we know not in what heaviness the mirth may end. Here is the alarm given to Babylon, when forced by Cyrus. An ass and a camel seem to be the symbols of the Medes and Persians. Babylon's idols shall be so far from protecting her, that they shall be broken down. True believers are the corn of God's floor; hypocrites are but as chaff and straw, with which the wheat is now mixed, but from which it shall be separated. The corn of God's floor must expect to be threshed by afflictions and persecutions. God's Israel of old was afflicted. Even then God owns it is his still. In all events concerning the church, past, present, and to come, we must look to God, who has power to do any thing for his church, and grace to do every thing that is for her good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen - This passage is very obscure from the ambiguity of the word &#1512;&#1499;&#1489;  rekeb - 'chariot.' Gesenius contends that it should be rendered 'cavalry,' and that it refers to cavalry two abreast hastening to the destruction of the city. The word &#1512;&#1499;&#1489;  rekeb denotes properly a chariot or wagon <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-28.htm">Judges 5:28</a>; a collection of wagons <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-14.htm">2 Chronicles 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-6.htm">2 Chronicles 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-25.htm">2 Chronicles 9:25</a>; and sometimes refers to the "horses or men" attached to a chariot. 'David houghed all the chariots' <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-4.htm">2 Samuel 8:4</a>; that is, all the "horses" belonging to them. 'David killed of the Syrians seven hundred chariots' <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-18.htm">2 Samuel 10:18</a>; that is, all "the men" belonging to seven hundred chariots. According to the present Masoretic pointing, the word &#1512;&#1499;&#1489;  rekeb does not mean, perhaps, anything else than a chariot strictly, but other forms of the word with the same letters denote "riders or cavalry." Thus, the word &#1512;&#1499;&#1489;  raka&#770;b denotes a horseman <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-17.htm">2 Kings 9:17</a>; a charioteer or driver of a chariot <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-34.htm">1 Kings 22:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-21.htm">Jeremiah 51:21</a>. The verb &#1512;&#1489;&#1489;  ra&#770;bab means "to ride," and is usually applied to riding on the backs of horses or camels; and the sense here is, that the watchman saw "a riding," or persons riding two abreast; that is, "cavalry," or men borne on horses, and camels, and asses, and hastening to attack the city.<p>With a couple of horsemen - The word 'couple' (&#1510;&#1502;&#1491;  tsemed) means properly a "yoke or pair;" and it means here that the cavalry was seen "in pairs, that is," two abreast.<p>A chariot of asses - Or rather, as above, "a riding" on donkeys - an approach of men in this manner to battle. Asses were formerly used in war where horses could not be procured. Thus Strabo (xv. 2, 14) says of the inhabitants of Caramania, 'Many use donkeys for war in the want of horses.' And Herodotus (iv. 129) says expressly that Darius Hystaspes employed donkeys in a battle with the Scythians.<p>And a chariot of camels - A "riding" on camels. Camels also were used in war, perhaps usually to carry the baggage (see Diod. ii. 54; iii. 44; Livy, xxxvii. 40; Strabo, xvi. 3). They are used for all purposes of burden in the East, and particularly in Arabia. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. chariot, &c.&#8212;rather, "a body of riders," namely, some riding in pairs on horses (literally, "pairs of horsemen," that is, two abreast), others on asses, others on camels (compare Isa 21:9; Isa 22:6). "Chariot" is not appropriate to be joined, as English Version translates, with "asses"; the Hebrew means plainly in Isa 21:7, as in Isa 21:9, "a body of men riding." The Persians used asses and camels for war [Maurer]. Horsley translates, "One drawn in a car, with a pair of riders, drawn by an ass, drawn by a camel"; Cyrus is the man; the car drawn by a camel and ass yoked together and driven by two postilions, one on each, is the joint army of Medes and Persians under their respective leaders. He thinks the more ancient military cars were driven by men riding on the beasts that drew them; Isa 21:9 favors this.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And he saw; </span> a short speech for he told me that he saw. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A chariot, </span> not for burden, but for war, in which chariots were then much used.

This apparently is the expected sign that great events are on foot; when the riders are seen the watchman is to listen intently to discover who they are and what they are doing. The word for “troop” means always “chariot” (usually collective); here it must be used in the sense of “riding train” like the Arab. <span class="ital">rakb</span>. The procession represents the Persian army. “Asses” and “camels” are probably introduced as beasts of burden, although both animals are reported to have been used by the Persians in actual battle.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he saw... he hearkened</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he shall see</span>... he <span class="accented">shall hearken</span> (Kay).

"As storms in the south approach, it comes from the desert, from a terrible land. Hard vision is made known to me: the spoiler spoils, and the devastator devastates. Go up, Elam! Surround, Maday! I put an end to all their sighing." "Storms in the south" (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-21.htm">Isaiah 28:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-9.htm">Amos 3:9</a>) are storms which have their starting-point in the south, and therefore come to Babylon from Arabia deserta; and like all winds that come from boundless steppes, they are always violent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-19.htm">Job 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-9.htm">Job 37:9</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-15.htm">Hosea 13:15</a>). It would be natural, therefore, to connect mimmidba&#770;r with lachalo&#772;ph (as Knobel and Umbreit do), but the arrangement of the words is opposed to this; lachalo&#772;o&#772;ph ("pressing forwards") is sued instead of yachalo&#772;ph (see Ges. 132, Anm. 1, and still more fully on <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-17.htm">Habakkuk 1:17</a>). The conjunctio periphrastica stands with great force at the close of the comparison, in order that it may express at the same time the violent pressure with which the progress of the storm is connected. It is true that, according to Herod. i. 189, Cyrus came across the Gyndes, so that he descended into the lowlands to Babylonia through Chalonitis and Apolloniatis, by the road described by Isidor V. Charax in his Itinerarium,<p>(Note: See C. Masson's "Illustration of the route from Seleucia to Apobatana, as given by Isid. of Charax," in the Asiatic Journal, xii. 97ff.)<p>over the Zagros pass through the Zagros-gate (Ptolem. vi. 2) to the upper course of the Gyndes (the present Diyala), and then along this river, which he crossed before its junction with the Tigris. But if the Medo-Persian army came in this direction, it could not be regarded as coming "from the desert." If, however, the Median portion of the army followed the course of the Choaspes (Kerkha) so as to descend into the lowland of Chuzistan (the route taken by Major Rawlinson with a Guran regiment),<p>(Note: See Rawlinson's route as described in Ritter's Erdkunde, ix. 3((West-asien), p. 397ff.)<p>and thus approached Babylon from the south-east, it might be regarded in many respects as coming mimmidba&#770;r (from the desert), and primarily because the lowland of Chuzistan is a broad open plain - that is to say, a midba&#770;r. According to the simile employed of storms in the south, the assumption of the prophecy is really this, that the hostile army is advancing from Chuzistan, or (as geographical exactitude is not to be supposed) from the direction of the desert of ed-Dahna, that portion of Arabia deserta which bounded the lowland of Chaldean on the south-west. The Medo-Persian land itself is called "a terrible land," because it was situated outside the circle of civilised nations by which the land of Israel was surrounded. After the thematic commencement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-1.htm">Isaiah 21:1</a>, which is quite in harmony with Isaiah's usual custom, the prophet begins again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a>. Cha&#770;zuth (a vision) has the same meaning here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-11.htm">Isaiah 29:11</a> (though not <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-18.htm">Isaiah 28:18</a>); and cha&#770;zuth ka&#770;sha&#770;h is the object of the passive which follows (Ges. 143, 1, b). The prophet calls the look into the future, which is given to him by divine inspiration, hard or heavy (though in the sense of difficilis, not gravis, ca&#770;be&#772;d), on account of its repulsive, unendurable, and, so to speak, indigestible nature. The prospect is wide-spread plunder and devastation (the expression is the same as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-1.htm">Isaiah 33:1</a>, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-4.htm">Isaiah 16:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16</a>, ba&#770;gad denoting faithless or treacherous conduct, then heartless robbery), and the summoning of the nations on the east and north of Babylonia to the conquest of Babylon; for Jehovah is about to put an end (hishbatti, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-10.htm">Isaiah 16:10</a>) to all their sighing (ancha&#770;tha&#770;h, with He raf. and the tone upon the last syllable), i.e., to all the lamentations forced out of them far and wide by the oppressor. </body></html>
