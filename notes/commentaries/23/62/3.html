So they set a fair turban on his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.">Zechariah 3:5</a>). The two “hands” are expressed by different words in the Hebrew, the second having the sense of the open <span class= "ital">palm </span>of the hand. The “new crown,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the new glory accruing to Jehovah from the restoration of Jerusalem, is not worn on the head (thought of, we may believe, as already crowned from eternity), but held forth in the hand for the gaze of the adoring nations.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/isaiah/62.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Isaiah<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">MAN’S CROWN AND GOD’S<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-5.htm" title="In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, to the residue of his people,">Isaiah 28:5</a></span>. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-3.htm" title="You shall also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.">Isaiah 62:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Connection of first prophecy-destruction of Samaria. Its situation, crowning the hill with its walls and towers, its fertile ‘fat valley,’ the flagrant immorality and drunkenness of its inhabitants, and its final ruin, are all presented in the highly imaginative picture of its fall as being like the trampling under foot of a garland on a reveller’s head, the roses of which fade and droop amid the fumes of the banqueting hall, and are then flung out on the highway. The contrast presented is very striking and beautiful. When all that gross and tumultuous beauty has faded and died, then God Himself will be a crown of beauty to His people.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The second text comes into remarkable line with this. The verbal resemblance is not quite so strong in the original. The words for <span class="ital">diadem</span> and <span class="ital">crown</span> are not the same; the word rendered <span class="ital">glory</span> in the second text is rendered <span class="ital">beauty</span> in the first, but the two texts are entirely one in meaning. The same metaphor, then, is used with reference to what God is to the Church and what the Church is to God. He is its crown, it is His.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The Possession of God is the Coronation of Man.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{a} Crowns were worn by guests at feasts. They who possess God sit at a table perpetually spread with all which the soul can wish or want. Contrast the perishable delights of sense and godless life with the calm and immortal joys of communion with God; ‘a crown that fadeth not away’ beside withered garlands.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{b} Crowns were worn by kings. They who serve God are thereby invested with rule over selves, over circumstances, over all externals. He alone gives completeness to self-control.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{c} Crowns were worn by priests. The highest honour and dignity of man’s nature is thereby reached. To have God is like a beam of sunshine on a garden, which brings out the colours of all the flowers; contrast with the same garden in the grey monotony of a cloudy twilight.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The Coronation of Man in God is the Coronation of God in Man.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>That includes the following thoughts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The true glory of God is in the communication of Himself. What a wonderful light that throws on divine character! It is equivalent to ‘God is Love.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> He who is glorified by God glorifies God, as showing the most wonderful working of His power in making such a man out of such material, by an alchemy that can convert base metal into fine gold; as showing the most wonderful condescension of His love in taking to His heart man, into whose flesh the rotting leprosy of sin has eaten.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Such a man will glorify God by becoming a conscious herald of His praise. He who has God in his heart will magnify Him by lip and life. Redeemed men are ‘secretaries of His praise’ to men, and ‘to principalities and powers in heavenly places is made known by the Church the manifold wisdom of God.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> He who thus glorifies God is held in God’s hand.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘None shall pluck them out of My Father’s hand.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> All this will be perfected in heaven. Redeemed men lead the universal chorus that thunders forth ‘glory to Him that sitteth on the throne.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘He shall come to be glorified in His saints.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘Glorify Thy Son, that Thy Son also may glorify Thee.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/62.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-3.htm" title="You shall also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.">Isaiah 62:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou shalt be a crown of glory </span>— Or, <span class="ital">a beautiful crown, </span>as Bishop Lowth renders <span class="greekheb">עשׂרה תפארה</span>.

Some difficulty has been felt by expositors in explaining this, from the fact that a crown or diadem was worn on the head and not held in the hand, and some have supposed that the word 'crown' here is equivalent to any ornament which might be either horne in the hand or worn on the head; others have supposed that the reference is to the custom of carrying a chaplet or garland in the hand on festival occasions. But probably the sense is this, 'Thou shalt I be so beautiful and prosperous as to be appropriately regarded as a splendid crown or diadem. God shall keep thee as a beautiful diadem - the crown of beauty among the cities of the earth, and as that which is most comely and valuable in his sight.' This is the sense expressed by Gataker and Rosenmuller.<p>And a royal diadem - Hebrew, 'A diadem of a kingdom.' The diadem is the wreath or chaplet, usually set with diamonds, which is "encircled" (&#1510;&#1504;&#1497;&#1507;  tsa&#770;n&#305;&#770;yph from     &#1510;&#1504;&#1507;  tsa&#770;naph) to roll or wind around, to encircle) around the head. It here means such as was usually worn by monarchs; and the sense is, that Jerusalem would become exceedingly beautiful in the sight of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/62.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

His people are in His hand at the same time that they are "a crown of glory" to Him (Re 6:2; 19:12); reciprocally, He is "a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty" to them (Isa 28:5; compare Mal 3:17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/62.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A crown of glory; </span> an expression to set forth the dignity of her state. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the hand of the Lord, </span> i.e. either as placed upon thee by God’s hand, that he will dispose of or dispense to thee; a usual form of speech in Scripture, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-1.htm" title="In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,">Haggai 1:1</a></span>, by the hand of Haggai: so <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-1.htm" title="The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.">Malachi 1:1</a></span>.

The enigmatical first half of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a> is explained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-2.htm">Isaiah 61:2</a>, where mishneh is shown to consist of double possession in the land of their inheritance, which has not only been restored to them, but extended far beyond the borders of their former possession; and ya&#770;ro&#772;nnu&#772; chelqa&#770;m (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-14.htm">Isaiah 65:14</a>) denotes excessive rejoicing in the ground and soil belonging to them (according to the appointment of Jehovah): chelqa&#770;m as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-4.htm">Micah 2:4</a>; and mishneh as equivalent not to &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, but to &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;. Taking this to be the relation between <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a>, the meaning of la&#770;khe&#772;n is not, "therefore, because they have hitherto suffered shame and reproach;" but what is promised in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a> is unfolded according to its practical results, the effects consequent upon its fulfilment being placed in the foreground; so that there is less to astonish us in the elliptically brief form of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a> which needed explanation. The transition from the form of address to that of declaration is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-29.htm">Isaiah 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-6.htm">Isaiah 31:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-14.htm">Isaiah 52:14-15</a>. &#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is a concise expression for &#1499;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; &#1493;&#1514;&#1495;&#1514;, just as &#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-9.htm">Isaiah 48:9</a> is for &#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497; &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503;. Chelqa&#770;m is either the accusative of the object, according to the construction of &#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1503;, which occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16</a>; or what I prefer, looking at &#1495;&#1502;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-25.htm">Isaiah 42:25</a>, and &#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1498; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-23.htm">Isaiah 43:23</a>, an adverbial accusative  equals  &#1489;&#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1501;. The lxx, Jerome, and Saad. render the clause, in opposition to the accents, "instead of your double shame and reproach;" but in that case the principal words of the clause would read &#1492;&#1500;&#1511;&#1499;&#1501; &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;. The explanation adopted by the Targum, Saad., and Jerome, "shame on the part of those who rejoice in their portion," is absolutely impossible. The great majority of the modern commentators adopt essentially the same explanation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a> as we have done, and even A. E. Kimchi does the same. Hahn's modification, "instead of your shame is the double their portion, and (instead) of the insult this, that they will rejoice," forces a meaning upon the syntax which is absolutely impossible. The reason for the gracious recompense for the wrong endured is given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-8.htm">Isaiah 61:8</a>, "Jehovah loves the right," which the enemies of Israel have so shamefully abused. "He hates &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; &#1490;&#1494;&#1500;, i.e., not rapinam in holocausto (as Jerome, Talmud b. Succa 30a, Luther, and others render it; Eng. ver. "robbery for burnt-offering") - for what object would there be in mentioning sacrifices here, seeing that only heathen sacrifices could be intended, and there would be something worse than ga&#770;ze&#772;l to condemn in them? - but robbery, or, strictly speaking, "something robbed in or with knavery" (lxx, Targ., Syr., Saad.), which calls to mind at once the cruel robbery or spoiling that Israel had sustained from the Chaldeans, its bo&#772;zez&#305;&#772;m (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-24.htm">Isaiah 42:24</a>) - a robbery which passed all bounds. &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; is softened from &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; (from &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;, &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;), like &#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/5-16.htm">Job 5:16</a>, and &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-3.htm">Psalm 58:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-7.htm">Psalm 64:7</a>; though it is doubtful whether the punctuation assumes the latter, as the Targum does, and not rather the meaning holocaustum supported by the Talmud. For the very reason, therefore, that Israel had been so grievously ill-treated by the instruments of punishment employed by Jehovah, He would give those who had been ill-treated their due reward, after He had made the evil, which He had not approved, subservient to His own salutary purposes. &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; is the reward of work in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>, of hardship in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-20.htm">Ezekiel 29:20</a>; here it is the reward of suffering. This reward He would give &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1514;, exactly as He had promised, without the slightest deduction. The posterity of those who have been ill-treated and insulted will be honourably known (&#1504;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a>) in the world of nations, and men will need only to catch sight of them to recognise them (by prominent marks of blessing), for they are a family blessed of God. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, not quod (because), although it might have this meaning, but nam (for), as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-23.htm">Genesis 27:23</a>, since hikk&#305;&#772;r includes the meaning agnoscere (to recognise). </body></html>
