He brings a reward of comfort and peace with him; but a work of humiliation and reformation before him; and they shall be called, The holy people, and, The redeemed of the Lord. Holiness puts honour and beauty upon any place or person, makes them admired, beloved, and sought after. Many events may have been part fulfilments of this, as earnests of more glorious times yet to come. The close connexion between the blessedness of the Jews and of the Gentiles, runs through the Scriptures. The Lord Jesus will complete his work, and he never will forsake one whom he has redeemed and sanctified.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/62.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold the Lord hath proclaimed - Proclamation is made to all nations that Yahweh is about to come and rescue his people.<p>Say ye to the daughter of Zion - To Jerusalem (see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>).<p>Thy salvation cometh - Lowth renders this, 'Lo!, thy Saviour cometh.'

This is not to be interpreted of the proclamation by Cyrus, giving liberty to the people of the Jews to return to their own land, for that did not reach to the end of the world; but of the proclamation of the Gospel, which, as when first published, the sound of it went into all the earth, and the words of it to the ends of the world, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-18.htm">Romans 10:18</a>.

The Targum is, <p>"behold, a reward to them that do his word is with him, and all their works are manifest before him.'' <p>The word behold is three times used in this verse, to raise attention to what is said, and as pointing out something wonderful, and to express the certainty of it. <p>(l) "tuus Salvator", V.

"Men will no more call thee 'Forsaken one;' and thy land they will no more call 'Desert:' but men will name thee 'My delight in her,' and thy home 'Married one:' for Jehovah hath delight in thee, and thy land is married. For the young man marrieth the maiden, thy children will marry thee; and as the bridegroom rejoiceth in the bride, thy God will rejoice in thee." The prophecy mentions new names, which will now take the place of the old ones; but these names indicate what Zion appears to be, not her true nature which is brought to the light. In the explanatory clause &#1500;&#1498; stands at the head, because the name of Zion is given first in distinction from the name of her land. Zion has hitherto been called &#8219;a&#774;zu&#772;bha&#770;h, forsaken by Jehovah, who formerly loved her; but she now receives instead the name of chephts&#305;&#772;-bha&#770;h (really the name of a woman, viz., the wife of Hezekiah, and mother of Manasseh, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-1.htm">2 Kings 21:1</a>), for she is now the object of true affection on the part of Jehovah. With the rejoicing of a bridegroom in his bride (the accusative is used here in the same sense as in &#1490;&#1491;&#1500;&#1492; &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;&#1492; &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;; Ges. 138, 1) will her God rejoice in her, turning to her again with a love as strong and deep as the first love of a bridal pair. And the land of Zion's abode, the fatherland of her children, was hitherto called shema&#770;ma&#770;h; it was turned into a desert by the heathen, and the connection that existed between it and the children of the land was severed; but now it shall be called be&#8219;u&#772;la&#770;h, for it will be newly married. A young man marries a virgin, thy children will marry thee: the figure and the fact are placed side by side in the form of an emblematical proverb, the particle of comparison being omitted (see Herzog's Cyclopaedia, xiv 696, and Ges. 155, 2, h). The church in its relation to Jehovah is a weak but beloved woman, which has Him for its Lord and Husband (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>); but in relation to her home she is the totality of those who are lords or possessors (ba&#8219;ale&#772;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>) of the land, and who call the land their own as it were by right of marriage. Out of the loving relation in which the church stands to its God, there flows its relation of authority over every earthly thing of which it stands in need. In some MSS there is a break here. </body></html>
