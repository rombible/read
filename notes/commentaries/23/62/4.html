And his mother's name was Hephzibah.">2Kings 21:1</a>), which, on the assumption of Isaiah’s authorship of these chapters, would be fresh in the prophet’s memory. It would be entirely after his manner to see in the bride’s name, as in those of his own sons, an omen of the future. The fact that the Hebrew word for Forsaken (<span class= "ital">Azubah</span>) had been borne by a previous queen, the mother of Jehoshaphat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-42.htm" title="Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem.

He alludes to the desolation of Judah during the Babylonish captivity. <span class="ital">But thou shalt be called Hephzibah </span>— <span class="ital">My delight is in her; </span>a new name, agreeing with her new condition; <span class="ital">and thy land, Beulah</span> — <span class="ital">Married, </span>agreeing to her new relation. Whereas she was in a desolate condition, she shall now be as a woman well married, to the great improvement of her state. <span class="ital">And thy land shall be married </span>— Thou shalt see the increase of thy children again in the land, as the fruit of thy married condition, who, by reason of thy being forsaken of thy husband, were, in a manner, wasted and decayed: and this refers to the great enlargement of the church in the gospel days. Or, thy land <span class="ital">shall be possessed, </span>as <span class="greekheb">הבעל</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>may be properly rendered, and so the expression answers to <span class="ital">desolate. </span>Thou shalt be no more <span class="ital">desolate, </span>but <span class="ital">possessed. For as a young man marrieth a virgin </span>— In whom he takes great delight, and whom he exceedingly loves; <span class="ital">so shall thy sons marry thee </span>— That is, they shall live with thee, and take great delight in thee. For, as Lowth justly observes, “the word <span class="ital">marry </span>is not to be taken strictly, for it would be improper to say that children married their mother.” Thus the LXX., <span class="greekheb">ουτω κατοικησουσιν οι υιοισου</span>, <span class="ital">so shall thy sons dwell with thee. </span>Bishop Lowth, however, instead of <span class="ital">sons, </span>renders <span class="greekheb">בנין</span><span class="ital">thy builder, </span>or <span class="ital">creator, </span>altering or disregarding the Hebrew points. This emendation, it most be acknowledged, would clear the prophet of the impropriety of using a similitude, which implies that Jerusalem was guilty of incest in marrying her sons; and at the same time would add not only grace but force to the whole verse, which, so altered, runs thus: <span class="ital">For, as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy Creator marry thee. And as the bridegroom, </span>&c. — The former interpretation, however, which has the sanction of the LXX., and which the present pointing of the Hebrew requires, seems preferable. In the first clause, <span class="ital">As a young man marrieth a virgin, </span>Sir John Chardin, in his MS. note on the place, considers the prophet as expressing himself according to the custom of the East, which was, and is, “for youths, that were never married, always to marry virgins; and widowers, however young, to marry widows.” See Harmer’s <span class="ital">Observ., 43. </span>p. 482.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/62.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>62:1-5 The Son of God here assures his church of his unfailing love, and his pleading for her under all trails and difficulties.

This refers to the new name which the prophet says <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-2.htm">Isaiah 62:2</a> will be conferred on her.<p>Neither shall thy land - Thy country shall no more be so wasted that the term desolation (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492;  shema&#770;ma&#770;h, Greek &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  ere&#772;mos) shall be properly applied to it.<p>But thou shalt be called Hepzi-bah - Margin, as Hebrew, 'My delight is in her.' The idea is, that Yahweh would show her such favor, and he would have so much pleasure in his people, that this name of endearment would be appropriately given to her. The Septuagint renders this, &#x398;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;  Thele&#772;ma emon - 'My will,' or my delight. The sense is, that Jerusalem would be eminently the object of his delight.<p>And thy land Beulah - Margin, as Hebrew, 'Married;' or rather, 'thou art married.' The Septuagint renders it, &#x39f;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;  Oikoumene&#772; - 'Inhabited.' Lowth renders it, 'The wedded matron.' The figure is taken from a female who had been divorced, and whose appropriate name was Forsaken.' God says here that the appropriate name henceforward would not be the Forsaken, but the married one - the one favored and blessed of God (see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1.htm">Isaiah 1</a>. 1). Language like this is common in the East. 'A sovereign is spoken of as married to his dominions; they mutually depend on each other.

The meaning of these names is explained in the next clause; or the reason of their being given: <p>for the Lord delighteth in thee, and thy land is married; the former explains "Hephzibah", which signifies "my delight is in her"; Christ delighted in his church from everlasting, as they were the objects of his own and his Father's love; as chosen in him, and given to him as his spouse and bride, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-31.htm">Proverbs 8:31</a> and he delights in them in time, as clothed with his righteousness, washed in his blood, and adorned with the graces of his Spirit; he delights in their company, to hear their voice, and see their countenance; they are the excellent in the earth, in whom is all his delight, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/16-2.htm">Psalm 16:2</a>, and he will delight in them hereafter, in the spiritual reign, when he will glorify and beautify them, and make them an eternal excellency, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-7.htm">Isaiah 60:7</a>, and in the personal reign, when they shall be as a bride adorned for her husband, and his tabernacle shall be among them, and he will reign with them, and they with him; during which time he will be presenting them to himself, and delighting in them, as a glorious church, without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a> and in heaven to all eternity. The latter clause explains "Beulah", which signifies "married", as the church secretly was to Christ from all eternity; in the latter day the espousals of her to him will be more open and manifest; then the marriage of the Lamb will be come, and it will more clearly appear that she is in such a state, by the numerous converts in her, or sons and daughters that will be born in her to Christ, both of Jews and Gentiles, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/62.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou shalt no more be termed <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzibah, and thy land Beulah: for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> married.</span><p>(e) You will no longer be contemned as a woman forsaken by her husband.<p>(f) That it may be replenished with children.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/62.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4, 5</span>.

Judah had believed herself" forsaken" of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-14.htm">Isaiah 49:14</a>), and had actually been, in a certain sense, forsaken "for a small moment" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-7.htm">Isaiah 54:7</a>). Her enemies, it would seem, had gone so far as to give her the name in derision<span class="cmt_word">. Neither shall thy land ...  be termed Desolate</span>. Judaea had not only been desolated by the Babylonian invaders under Nebucbarlnezzar, but had remained "desolate" during the whole period of the Captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-13.htm">Isaiah 32:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-19.htm">Isaiah 49:19</a>, etc.). It had come to be spoken of as <span class="accented">Sh'marnah</span>, "a desolation" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-22.htm">Jeremiah 34:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-2.htm">Jeremiah 44:2, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-29.htm">Ezekiel 33:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-34.htm">Ezekiel 36:34</a>).

Beulah, or rather Be'ulah, means "married" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-1.htm">Isaiah 54:1</a>). Judaea would be "married" to her sons, or her people, when they quitted Babylon and once more took possession of her.

And their family will be known among the nations, and their offspring in the midst of the nations: all who see them will recognise them, for they are a family that Jehovah hath blessed." The enigmatical first half of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a> is explained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-2.htm">Isaiah 61:2</a>, where mishneh is shown to consist of double possession in the land of their inheritance, which has not only been restored to them, but extended far beyond the borders of their former possession; and ya&#770;ro&#772;nnu&#772; chelqa&#770;m (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-14.htm">Isaiah 65:14</a>) denotes excessive rejoicing in the ground and soil belonging to them (according to the appointment of Jehovah): chelqa&#770;m as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-4.htm">Micah 2:4</a>; and mishneh as equivalent not to &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, but to &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;. Taking this to be the relation between <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a>, the meaning of la&#770;khe&#772;n is not, "therefore, because they have hitherto suffered shame and reproach;" but what is promised in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a> is unfolded according to its practical results, the effects consequent upon its fulfilment being placed in the foreground; so that there is less to astonish us in the elliptically brief form of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a> which needed explanation. The transition from the form of address to that of declaration is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-29.htm">Isaiah 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-6.htm">Isaiah 31:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-14.htm">Isaiah 52:14-15</a>. &#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is a concise expression for &#1499;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; &#1493;&#1514;&#1495;&#1514;, just as &#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-9.htm">Isaiah 48:9</a> is for &#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497; &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503;. Chelqa&#770;m is either the accusative of the object, according to the construction of &#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1503;, which occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16</a>; or what I prefer, looking at &#1495;&#1502;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-25.htm">Isaiah 42:25</a>, and &#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1498; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-23.htm">Isaiah 43:23</a>, an adverbial accusative  equals  &#1489;&#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1501;. The lxx, Jerome, and Saad. render the clause, in opposition to the accents, "instead of your double shame and reproach;" but in that case the principal words of the clause would read &#1492;&#1500;&#1511;&#1499;&#1501; &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;. The explanation adopted by the Targum, Saad., and Jerome, "shame on the part of those who rejoice in their portion," is absolutely impossible. The great majority of the modern commentators adopt essentially the same explanation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a> as we have done, and even A. E. Kimchi does the same. Hahn's modification, "instead of your shame is the double their portion, and (instead) of the insult this, that they will rejoice," forces a meaning upon the syntax which is absolutely impossible. The reason for the gracious recompense for the wrong endured is given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-8.htm">Isaiah 61:8</a>, "Jehovah loves the right," which the enemies of Israel have so shamefully abused. "He hates &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; &#1490;&#1494;&#1500;, i.e., not rapinam in holocausto (as Jerome, Talmud b. Succa 30a, Luther, and others render it; Eng. ver. "robbery for burnt-offering") - for what object would there be in mentioning sacrifices here, seeing that only heathen sacrifices could be intended, and there would be something worse than ga&#770;ze&#772;l to condemn in them? - but robbery, or, strictly speaking, "something robbed in or with knavery" (lxx, Targ., Syr., Saad.), which calls to mind at once the cruel robbery or spoiling that Israel had sustained from the Chaldeans, its bo&#772;zez&#305;&#772;m (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-24.htm">Isaiah 42:24</a>) - a robbery which passed all bounds. &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; is softened from &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; (from &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;, &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;), like &#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/5-16.htm">Job 5:16</a>, and &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-3.htm">Psalm 58:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-7.htm">Psalm 64:7</a>; though it is doubtful whether the punctuation assumes the latter, as the Targum does, and not rather the meaning holocaustum supported by the Talmud. For the very reason, therefore, that Israel had been so grievously ill-treated by the instruments of punishment employed by Jehovah, He would give those who had been ill-treated their due reward, after He had made the evil, which He had not approved, subservient to His own salutary purposes. &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; is the reward of work in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>, of hardship in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-20.htm">Ezekiel 29:20</a>; here it is the reward of suffering. This reward He would give &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1514;, exactly as He had promised, without the slightest deduction. The posterity of those who have been ill-treated and insulted will be honourably known (&#1504;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a>) in the world of nations, and men will need only to catch sight of them to recognise them (by prominent marks of blessing), for they are a family blessed of God. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, not quod (because), although it might have this meaning, but nam (for), as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-23.htm">Genesis 27:23</a>, since hikk&#305;&#772;r includes the meaning agnoscere (to recognise). </body></html>
