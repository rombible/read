Spiritual judgments are more to be dreaded than any other calamities; and we should most carefully avoid those sins which justly provoke the Lord to leave men to themselves and to their deceiver.

The word rendered 'sounding' (&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;  ha&#770;mo&#770;n), means properly a noise or sound, as of rain; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-41.htm">1 Kings 18:41</a>; of singing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-13.htm">Ezekiel 26:13</a>; of a multitude, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-14.htm">1 Samuel 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-19.htm">1 Samuel 14:19</a>.

Here it relates to an emotion or affection of the mind; and the phrase denotes compassion, or tender concern for them in their sufferings. It is derived from the customary expression in the Bible that the bowels, that is, the organs in the region of the chest - for so the word is used in the Scriptures - were the seat of the emotions, and were supposed to be affected by any strong and tender emotion of the mind (see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a>).

Here begins the prayer of the church and people of God, which continues to the end of the chapter, goes through the next, and the answer to which begins at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-1.htm">Isaiah 65:1</a>. Aben Ezra calls it the prayer of the wise in captivity: it seems to be the petition of some converts among the Jews, either in the first times of the Gospel, or in the latter day; who entreat that the Lord would "look down from heaven", the third heaven, the seat of his majesty, where is his throne of glory, and his presence is most visible to angels and glorified saints; this is on high, as the phrase imports; and the persons below, on earth, at his footstool, whom he is desired to look down upon, and which to do is a great condescension in him, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/113-6.htm">Psalm 113:6</a>, and this is to be understood, not of that general view of persons and things, which he is always taking, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/33-13.htm">Psalm 33:13</a>, but of a special look of love, grace, and mercy; such an one with which he looks upon his people in Christ, with complacency and delight: indeed his eyes are always on them, and never withdrawn from them; he ever looks upon them, to preserve and protect them, to communicate unto them, to support them under their afflictions, and to deliver out of them; but because of this they are not always sensible, but are ready to conclude that he looks off from them, and turns his back upon them, therefore they desire him to return, look down, and behold; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/80-14.htm">Psalm 80:14</a>, <p>and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory; this is a description of heaven, as the dwelling place of God, who is most holy, holiness itself, in whom that perfection is most glorious, and which is displayed in all his works; and hence heaven is a holy as well as a high place, and where none but holy persons dwell; and which is a glorious place, where the glory of God is displayed, the glory of Christ is seen, and which is glory itself; and from hence the holy God is desired to behold; what creatures, dust, and ashes, sinful ones, polluted worms, at his footstool, a poor and an afflicted people: <p>where is thy zeal, and thy strength? his "jealousy" of his great name, and of his own glory; his jealousy of his dear people, that they are not wronged and injured; his "fervent love", and warm affections for them, of which he has given pregnant proofs; which, shed abroad in the heart, warms that, and is what many waters cannot quench: this indeed is not always alike manifest, and therefore unbelief asks where it is, as if it was quite gone; or, however, faith prays for a fresh manifestation of it. The "strength" or power of God has appeared in creation, and in the sustentation of all things; in Christ, the man of his right hand; in strengthening his people, destroying their enemies, and delivering them; and yet this not appearing sometimes at once, immediately for their help and protection, they ask where it is: it follows: <p>the sounding of thy bowels, and of thy mercies towards me? the noise and rumbling of the bowels, to which the allusion is, are sometimes occasioned by the working of strong passions, as fear and love, and which produce what is called the yearning of the bowels; of which there are instances in Joseph, and in the harlot in Solomon's time, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-30.htm">Genesis 43:30</a>, the tender mercies of God, his pity and compassion, are expressed hereby, to which are owing the mission of his Son, the forgiveness of sins, and help and relief under afflictions; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-77.htm">Luke 1:77</a>, now it is asked, where are those? <p>are they restrained? it was thought they were shut up in anger, and would not be let out again; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-7.htm">Psalm 77:7</a>. The phrase "towards me", in the former clause, seems, according to the accents, to belong to this; and should be read, "are they restrained towards me" (d)? or "shut up from me?" the Lord seemed to harden his heart against his church and people, and to have no heart of compassion towards them, as they imagined. <p>(d)  "erga me continerent se", Montanus; "continerent?"

From thanksgiving and confession, the people betake themselves to prayer, and beseech God to look down from heaven once more, to have compassion on them, to acknowledge them, and to save them alike from themselves (ver. 17) and from their adversaries (vers. 18, 19). "It is difficult to overrate the  spiritual beauty of the prayer contained in this passage. We may admit that the most prominent motive urged by the speaker has a nationalistic air; but behind this, and strengthening it, is a sense of the infiniteness of the Divine mercy, and of the <span class="accented">strong</span> vitality of the union between Jehovah and his people" (Cheyne). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Look down from heaven</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-15.htm">Deuteronomy 26:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-14.htm">Psalm 80:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8.htm">2 Kings 8</a>:30).

"In all their affliction He was afflicted, and the Angel of His face brought them salvation. In His love and in His pity He redeemed them, and lifted them up, and bare them all the days of the olden time." This is one of the fifteen passages in which the chethib has &#1500;&#1488;, the keri &#1500;&#1493;. It is only with difficulty that we can obtain any meaning from the chethib: "in all the affliction which He brought upon them He did not afflict, viz., according to their desert" (Targ., Jer., Rashi); or better still, as tsa&#770;r must in this case be derived from tsu&#772;r, and tsa&#774;r is only met with in an intransitive sense, "In all their distress there was no distress" (Saad.), with which J. D. Michaelis compares <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8</a>, "troubled on every side, yet not distressed." The oxymoron is perceptible enough, but the &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; (&#1510;&#1512; &#1500;&#1488;), which is indispensable to this expression, is wanting. Even with the explanation, "In all their affliction He was not an enemy, viz., Jehovah, to them" (Dderlein), or "No man persecuted them without the angel immediately," etc. (Cocceius and Rosenmller), we miss &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; or &#1488;&#1514;&#1501;. There are other still more twisted and jejune attempts to explain the passage with &#1500;&#1488;, which are not worth the space they occupy. Even in the older translators did not know how to deal with the &#1500;&#1488; in the text. The Sept. takes tsa&#774;r as equivalent to ts&#305;&#772;r, a messenger, and renders the passage according to its own peculiar interpunctuation: &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb; &#787; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2; (neither a messenger nor an angel, but His face, i.e., He Himself helped them: <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-11.htm">2 Samuel 17:11</a>). Everything forces to the conclusion that the keri &#1500;&#1493; is to be preferred. The Masora actually does reckon this as one of the fifteen passages in which &#1500;&#1493; is to be read for &#1500;&#1488;.<p>(Note: There are fifteen passages in which the keri substitutes &#1500;&#1493; for &#1500;&#1488;. See Masora magna on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-21.htm">Leviticus 11:21</a> (Psalter, ii. 60). If we add <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-5.htm">Isaiah 49:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-20.htm">1 Chronicles 11:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-16.htm">1 Samuel 2:16</a>, there are eighteen (Comm. on Job, at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>). But the first two of these are not reckoned, because they are doubtful; and in the third, instead of &#1500;&#1468;&#1493; being substituted for &#1500;&#1488;, &#1500;&#1488; is substituted for &#1500;&#1493; (Ges. Thes. 735, b). <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-7.htm">2 Samuel 19:7</a> also is not a case in point, for there the keri is &#1500;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1500;&#1488;.)<p>Jerome was also acquainted with this explanation. He says: "Where we have rendered it, 'In all their affliction He was not afflicted,' which is expressed in Hebrew by lo, the adverb of negation, we might read ipse; so that the sense would be, 'In all their affliction He, i.e., God, was afflicted.' " If we take the sentence in this way, "In all oppression there was oppression to Him," it yields a forcible thought in perfect accordance with the Scripture (compare e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-16.htm">Judges 10:16</a>), an expression in harmony with the usage of the language (compare tsar-l&#305;&#772;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-26.htm">2 Samuel 1:26</a>), and a construction suited to the contents (&#1500;&#1493;  equals  ipsi). There is nothing to surprise us in the fact that God should be said to feel the sufferings of His people as His own sufferings; for the question whether God can feel pain is answered by the Scriptures in the affirmative. He can as surely as everything originates in Him, with the exception of sin, which is a free act and only originates in Him so far as the possibility is concerned, but not in its actuality. Just as a man can feel pain, and yet in his personality keep himself superior to it, so God feels pain without His own happiness being thereby destroyed. And so did He suffer with His people; their affliction was reflected in His own life in Himself, and shared Him inwardly. But because He, the all-knowing, all-feeling One, is also the almighty will, He sent the angel of His face, and brought them salvation. "The angel of His face," says Knobel, "is the pillar of cloud and fire, in which Jehovah was present with His people in the march through the desert, with His protection, instruction, and guidance, the helpful presence of God in the pillar of cloud and fire." But where do we ever read of this, that it brought Israel salvation in the pressure of great dangers? Only on one occasion (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19-20</a>) does it cover the Israelites from their pursuers; but in that very instance a distinction is expressly made between the angel of God and the pillar of cloud. <p>Consequently the cloud and the angel were two distinct media of the manifestation of the presence of God. They differed in two respects. The cloud was a material medium - the evil, the sign, and the site of the revealed presence of God. The angel, on the other hand, was a personal medium, a ministering spirit (&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;), in which the name of Jehovah was indwelling for the purpose of His own self-attestation in connection with the historical preparation for the coming of salvation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-21.htm">Exodus 23:21</a>). He was the mediator of the preparatory work of God in both word and deed under the Old Testament, and the manifestation of that redeeming might and grace which realized in Israel the covenant promises given to Abraham (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15</a>). A second distinction consisted in the fact that the cloud was a mode of divine manifestation which was always visible; whereas, although the angel of God did sometimes appear in human shape both in the time of the patriarchs and also in that of Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13</a>.), it never appeared in such a form during the history of the exodus, and therefore is only to be regarded as a mode of divine revelation which was chiefly discernible in its effects, and belonged to the sphere of invisibility: so that in any case, if we search in the history of the people that was brought out of Egypt for the fulfilment of such promises as <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20-23</a>, we are forced to the conclusion that the cloud was the medium of the settled presence of God in His angel in the midst of Israel, although it is never so expressed in the thorah. This mediatorial angel is called "the angel of His face," as being the representative of God, for "the face of God" is His self-revealing presence (even though only revealed to the mental eye); and consequently the presence of God, which led Israel to Canaan, is called directly "His face" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-37.htm">Deuteronomy 4:37</a>, apart from the angelic mediation to be understood; and "my face" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14-15</a>, by the side of "my angel" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-34.htm">Exodus 32:34</a>, and the angel in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-2.htm">Exodus 33:2</a>, appears as something incomparably higher than the presence of God through the mediation of that one angel, whose personality is completely hidden by his mediatorial instrumentality. The genitive &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, therefore, is not to be taken objectively in the sense of "the angel who sees His face," but as explanatory, "the angel who is His face, or in whom His face is manifested." The &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; which follows does not point back to the angel, but to Jehovah, who reveals Himself thus. But although the angel is regarded as a distinct being from Jehovah, it is also regarded as one that is completely hidden before Him, whose name is in him. He redeemed them by virtue of His love and of His chemla&#770;h, i.e., of His forgiving gentleness (Arabic, with the letters transposed, chilm; compare, however, chamu&#772;l, gentle-hearted), and lifted them up, and carried them (&#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; the consequence of &#1504;&#1496;&#1468;&#1500;, which is similar in sense, and more Aramaean; cf., tollere root tal, and ferre root bhar, perf. tuli) all the days of the olden time. <p>The prayer passes now quite into the tone of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a> and 106, and begins to describe how, in spite of Jehovah's grace, Israel fell again and again away from Jehovah, and yet was always rescued again by virtue of His grace. For it is impossible that it should leap at once in &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; to the people who caused the captivity, and &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512; have for its subject the penitential church of the exiles which was longing for redemption (Ewald). The train of thought is rather this: From the proofs of grace which the Israel of the olden time had experienced, the prophet passes to that disobedience to Jehovah into which it fell, to that punishment of Jehovah which it thereby brought upon itself, and to that longing for the renewal of the old Mosaic period of redemption, which seized it in the midst of its state of punishment. But instead of saying that Jehovah did not leave this longing unsatisfied, and responded to the penitence of Israel with ever fresh help, the prophet passes at once from the desire of the old Israel for redemption, to the prayer of the existing Israel for redemption, suppressing the intermediate thought, that Israel was even now in such a state of punishment and longing. </body></html>
