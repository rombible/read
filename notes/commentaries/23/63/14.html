They acknowledge God's great mercies and favours to their nation. They confess their wickedness and hardness of heart; they entreat his forgiveness, and deplore the miserable condition under which they have so long suffered. The only-begotten Son of the Father became the Angel or Messenger of his love; thus he redeemed and bare them with tenderness. Yet they murmured, and resisted his Holy Spirit, despising and persecuting his prophets, rejecting and crucifying the promised Messiah. All our comforts and hopes spring from the loving-kindness of the Lord, and all our miseries and fears from our sins. But he is the Saviour, and when sinners seek after him, who in other ages glorified himself by saving and feeding his purchased flock, and leading them safely through dangers, and has given his Holy Spirit to prosper the labours of his ministers, there is good ground to hope they are discovering the way of peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/63.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As a beast that goeth down into the valley - As a herd of cattle in the heat of the day descends into the shady glen in order to find rest. In the vale, streams of water usually flow. By those streams and fountains trees grow luxuriantly, and these furnish a cool and refreshing shade. The cattle, therefore, in the heat of the day, naturally descend from the hills, where there are no fountains and streams, and where they are exposed to an intense sun, to seek refreshment in the shade of the valley. The figure here is that of resting in safety after exposure; and there are few more poetic and beautiful images of comfort than that furnished by cattle lying quietly and safely in the cool shade of a well-watered vale. This image would be much more striking in the intense heat of an Oriental climate than it is with us. Harmer (Obs. i. 168ff) supposes that the allusion here is to the custom prevailing still among the Arabs, when attacked by enemies, of withdrawing with their herds and flocks to some sequestered vale in the deserts, where they find safety. The idea, according to him, is, that Israel lay thus safely encamped in the wilderness; that they, with their flocks and herds and riches, were suffered to remain unattacked by the king of Egypt; and that this was a state of grateful repose, like that which a herd feels after having been closely pursued by an enemy, when it finds a safe retreat in some quiet vale. But it seems to me that the idea first suggested is the most correct - as it is, undoubtedly the most poetical and beautiful of a herd of cattle leaving the hills, and seeking a cooling shade and quiet retreat in a well-watered vale. Such repose, such calm, gentle, undisturbed rest, God gave his people. Such he gives them now, amidst sultry suns and storms, as they pass through the world.<p>The Spirit of the Lord - (See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10</a>).<p>So didst thou lead - That is, dividing the sea, delivering them from their foes, and leading them calmly and securely on to the land of rest. So now, amidst dangers seen and unseen, God leads his people on toward heaven. He removes the obstacles in their way; he subdues their foes; he 'makes them to lie down in green pastures, and leads them beside the still waters' <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a>; and he bears them forward to a world of perfect peace. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/63.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

Softly and gently, especially when laden; which may have some respect to the descent of the Israelites into the sea, into which they entered without any fear and dread, and without any hurry and precipitation, though Pharaoh's host was behind them; or rather, "as a beast goes along a valley", or "plain" (c); with ease, and without any interruption, so passed the Israelites through the sea. Thus the Targum renders it, <p>"as a beast goes, or is led, in a plain;'' <p>so the word is used in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-8.htm">Isaiah 38:8</a>, and elsewhere: <p>the Spirit of the Lord caused him to rest; or gently led him, that is, Israel; he walked on through the sea, with as much facility, and as little danger, as a beast walks on in a valley, or a horse in a plain. Some understand this of leading Israel through the wilderness, where often resting places were found for them, and at last they were brought to the land of rest, Canaan, and settled there: <p>so didst thou lead thy people; both through the sea, and through the wilderness, in a like easy, safe, and gentle manner: <p>to make thyself a glorious name; among the nations of the world, as he did by this amazing appearance of his for Israel; and it is hoped by those, whose words these are, he would do the like again, and get himself immortal glory. <p>(c)   "sicut jumentum quod in campo, vel valle, vel planitie, graditur", Gataker. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/63.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/63.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>.<span class="bld"> As the cattle that go down into the valley</span> (R.V.).

Israel's passage through the Sinaitic peninsula into Canaan is compared to the movement of a herd of cattle from its summer pastures in the mountains to the valley at their base, where for a time it rests. So God gave his people, after their many trials, "rest" in Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-11.htm">Hebrews 3:11-18</a><span class="cmt_word">). So didst thou lead thy people</span>. "So" refers, not to the last simile only, but to the entire description contained in vers. 11-14. <span class="cmt_word">To make thyself a glorious name</span> (comp. ver. 12, and see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-21.htm">Ezekiel 36:21-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-2.htm">Malachi 1:2</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/63.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet, as the leader of the prayers of the church, here passes into the expanded style of the tephillah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7</a> "I will celebrate the mercies of Jehovah, the praises of Jehovah, as is seemly for all that Jehovah hath shown us, and the great goodness towards the house of Israel, which He hath shown them according to His pity, and the riches of His mercies." The speaker is the prophet, in the name of the church, or, what is the same thing, the church in which the prophet includes himself. The prayer commences with thanksgiving, according to the fundamental rule in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a>. The church brings to its own remembrance, as the subject of praise in the presence of God, all the words and deeds by which Jehovah has displayed His mercy and secured glory to Himself. &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497; (this is the correct pointing, with &#1491; protected by gaya; cf., &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1499;&#1491; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-12.htm">Isaiah 54:12</a>) are the many thoughts of mercy and acts of mercy into which the grace of God, i.e., His one purpose of grace and His one work of grace, had been divided. They are just so many tehillo&#772;th, self-glorifications of God, and impulses to His glorification. On &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, as is seemly, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-18.htm">Isaiah 59:18</a>. There is no reason for assuming that &#1493;&#1512;&#1489;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; is equivalent to &#1512;&#1489;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1506;&#1500;, as Hitzig and Knobel do. &#1512;&#1489;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; commences the second object to &#1488;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, in which what follows is unfolded as a parallel to the first. Rabh, the much, is a neuter formed into a substantive, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-7.htm">Psalm 145:7</a>; ro&#772;bh, plurality or multiplicity, is an infinitive used as a substantive. Tu&#772;bh is God's benignant goodness; racha&#774;m&#305;&#772;m, His deepest sympathizing tenderness; chesed (root &#1495;&#1505;, used of violent emotion; cf., Syr. cha&#774;sad, cha&#774;sam, aemulari; Arab. h&#803;ss, to be tender, full of compassion), grace which condescends to and comes to meet a sinful creature. After this introit, the prayer itself commences with a retrospective glance at the time of the giving of law, when the relation of a child, in which Israel stood to Jehovah, was solemnly proclaimed and legally regulated. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-8.htm">Isaiah 63:8</a> "He said, They are my people, children who will not lie; and He became their Saviour." &#1488;&#1498; is used here in its primary affirmative sense. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is the future of hope. When He made them His people, His children, He expected from them a grateful return of His covenant grace in covenant fidelity; and whenever they needed help from above, He became their Saviour (mo&#772;sh&#305;&#772;a&#774;&#8219;). We can recognise the ring of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a> here, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-2.htm">Isaiah 12:2</a>. Mo&#772;sh&#305;&#772;a&#774;&#8219;) is a favourite word in chapters 40-66 (compare, however, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-20.htm">Isaiah 19:20</a> also). </body></html>
