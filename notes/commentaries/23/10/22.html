Men are not to expect that they, the hypocrites and evil-doers, shall escape their punishment. The promise of restoration is for the remnant only. (Comp. St. Paul’s application of the text in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/9-27.htm" title="Esaias also cries concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:">Romans 9:27-28</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">a finished </span>(or <span class= "ital">final</span>)<span class= "ital"> work, decisive, overflowing with righteousness. </span>A like phrase meets us again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-22.htm" title="Now therefore be you not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined on the whole earth.">Isaiah 28:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-27.htm" title="And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the middle of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured on the desolate.">Daniel 9:27</a>. The “finished work” is that of God’s judgment, and it “overflows with righteousness” at once punitive and corrective.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:20-34 By our afflictions we may learn not to make creatures our confidence. Those only can with comfort stay upon God, who return to him in truth, not in pretence and profession only. God will justly bring this wasting away on a provoking people, but will graciously set bounds to it. It is against the mind and will of God, that his people, whatever happens, should give way to fear. God's anger against his people is but for a moment; and when that is turned from us, we need not fear the fury of man. The rod with which he corrected his people, shall not only be laid aside, but thrown into the fire. To encourage God's people, the prophet puts them in mind of what God had formerly done against the enemies of his church. God's people shall be delivered from the Assyrians. Some think it looks to the deliverance of the Jews out of their captivity; and further yet, to the redemption of believers from the tyranny of sin and Satan. And this, because of the anointing; for his people Israel's sake, the believers among them that had received the unction of Divine grace. And for the sake of the Messiah, the Anointed of God. Here is, ver. 28-34, a prophetical description of Sennacherib's march towards Jerusalem, when he threatened to destroy that city. Then the Lord, in whom Hezekiah trusted, cut down his army like the hewing of a forest. Let us apply what is here written, to like matters in other ages of the church of Christ. Because of the anointing of our great Redeemer, the yoke of every antichrist must be broken from off his church: and if our souls partake of the unction of the Holy Spirit, complete and eternal deliverances will be secured to us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For though ... - In this verse, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-23.htm">Isaiah 10:23</a>. the prophet expresses positively the idea that "but" a remnant of the people should be preserved amidst the calamities. He had said <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-21</a>, that a remnant should return to God. He now carries forward the idea, and states that only a remnant should be preserved out of the multitude, however great it was. Admitting that the number was then very great, yet the great mass of the nation would be cut off, and only a small portion would remain.<p>Thy people Israel - Or rather, 'thy people, O Israel,' making it a direct address to the Jews, rather than to God.<p>Be as the sand of the sea - The sands of the sea cannot be numbered, and hence, the expression is used in the Bible to denote a number indefinitely great: <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-18.htm">Psalm 119:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-49.htm">Genesis 41:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-4.htm">Joshua 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-12.htm">Judges 7:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a>, ...<p>Yet a remnant - The word "yet" has been supplied by the translators, and evidently obscures the sense. The idea is, that a remnant only - a very small portion of the whole, should be preserved. Though they were exceedingly numerous as a nation, yet the mass of the nation would be cut off, or carried into captivity, and only a few would be left.<p>Shall return - That is, shall be saved from destruction, and return by repentance unto God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-21.htm">Isaiah 10:21</a>. Or, if it has reference to the approaching captivity of the nation, it means that but a few of them would return from captivity to the land of their fathers.<p>The consumption - The general sense of this is plain. The prophet is giving a reason why only a few of them would return, and he says, that the judgment which God had determined on was inevitable, and would overflow the land in justice. As God had determined this, their numbers availed nothing, but the consumption would be certainly accomplished. The word "consumption" &#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;  kila&#772;yo&#770;n from      &#1499;&#1500;&#1492;    ka&#770;la&#770;h to complete, to finish, to waste away, vanish, disappear) denotes a languishing, or wasting away, as in disease; and then "destruction," or that which "completes" life and prosperity. It denotes such a series of judgments as would be a "completion" of the national prosperity, or as should terminate it entirely.<p>Decreed - &#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509;  cha&#770;r&#305;&#770;yts. The word used here is derived from &#1495;&#1512;&#1509;  cha&#770;rats, to sharpen, or bring to a point; to rend, tear, lacerate; to be quick, active, diligent; and then to decide, determine, decree; because that which is decreed is brought to a point, or issue. - "Taylor." It evidently means here, that it was fixed upon or decreed in the mind of God, and that being thus decreed, it must certainly take place.<p>Shall overflow - &#1513;&#1473;&#1496;&#1507;  shot&#803;e&#772;ph. This word is usually applied to an inundation, when a stream rises above its banks and overflows the adjacent land; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-28.htm">Isaiah 30:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-12.htm">Isaiah 66:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-20.htm">Psalm 78:20</a>. Here it means evidently, that the threatened judgment would spread like an overflowing river through the land, and would accomplish the devastation which God had determined.<p>With righteousness - With justice, or in the infliction of justice. justice would abound or overflow, and the consequence would be, that the nation would be desolated. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. yet&#8212;rather in the sense in which Paul quotes it (Ro 9:27), "Though Israel be now numerous as the sand, a remnant only of them shall return"&#8212;the great majority shall perish. The reason is added, Because "the consumption (fully completed destruction) is decreed (literally, decided on, brought to an issue), it overfloweth (Isa 30:28; 8:8) with justice"; that is, the infliction of just punishment (Isa 5:16) [Maurer].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Israel; </span> or, <span class="ital">O Israel</span>; to whom by an apostrophe he directeth his speech. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A remnant; </span> or, <span class="ital">a remnant</span> only, as before; for that this is a threatening in respect of some, as well as a promise in respect of others, is evident from the rest of this and from the following verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The consumption decreed shall overflow; </span> the destruction of the people of Israel was already decreed or determined (as it is in the next verse) by the fixed counsel of God, and therefore must needs be executed, and like a deluge overflow them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">With righteousness, </span> as this word is rendered, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-28.htm" title="For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make on the earth.">Romans 9:28</a></span>; the preposition <span class="ital">in</span> or <span class="ital">with</span> being here understood, as it is every where. And this is added, to show, that although this judgment of God may seem very severe, yet it is most just, not only by the laws of strict and rigid justice, but even by the rules of equity and clemency, as this word oft signifies, inasmuch as he hath spared a considerable remnant of them, when he might have destroyed, them utterly. And so this word is added as a reason why a remnant, and why but a remnant, should return, because God would both glorify his justice, and manifest his mercy. And in this mixed sense the apostle seems to expound this place, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-27.htm" title="Esaias also cries concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:">Romans 9:27</a>,28</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea,.... These words are spoken either by the Lord to the prophet, calling Israel his people; or by the prophet to Hezekiah, as Jarchi and Kimchi think; or they may be rendered thus, "for though thy people, O Israel, be as the sand of the sea" (s); that is, innumerable, as was promised to Abraham, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>, <p>yet a remnant of them shall return; or "be converted in it" (t), to the Messiah; or "be saved", as the apostle interprets it; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-27.htm">Romans 9:27</a>; a remnant is a few, as Kimchi explains it, out of a great number: it signifies, that the majority of the Jewish nation should reject the Messiah, only a few of them should believe in him; and these should certainly believe in him, and be saved by him; and that for the following reason, because <p>the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness; that is, the precise and absolute decree, concerning the salvation of the remnant, God will cause to overflow, or abundantly execute, in a righteous manner, consistent with his divine perfections; and so it makes for the comfort of the remnant of the Lord's people, agreeably to the intent of the apostle's citation of it; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-28.htm">Romans 9:28</a>; though some understand it of God's punitive justice, in consuming and destroying the greater part of the Jewish people, the ungodly among them, and saving a remnant, which return and repent; and to this sense are the Targum, and the Jewish commentators. <p>(s) "Nam etsi fuerit populus tuus, O Israel, sicut arena maris", Piscator.

The “extermination” is the judgment which reduces the teeming population of Israel to a mere remnant; this will be an overwhelming manifestation of Jehovah’s judicial righteousness (see on ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-27.htm" title="Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.">Isaiah 1:27</a>). It seems impossible to take this clause in a consolatory sense, as if the verb “decreed” expressed the limitation fixed for the judgment. The very similar phraseology of the next verse, compared with ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-22.htm" title="Now therefore be you not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined on the whole earth.">Isaiah 28:22</a>, shews that the threatening aspect of the decree is prominent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-23.htm" title="For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the middle of all the land."><span class="bld">Isaiah 10:23</a>.</span> The verse reads: <span class="bld">For an extermination and a decisive work is the Lord Jehovah of Hosts about to execute in the midst of the whole earth</span> (or land): cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-22.htm" title="Now therefore be you not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined on the whole earth.">Isaiah 28:22</a>. The phrase “extermination and decisive work” is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-27.htm" title="And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the middle of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured on the desolate.">Daniel 9:27</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-36.htm" title="And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvelous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.">Daniel 11:36</a>).

The promise had been made to Abraham that his seed should be "like the sand of the sea for multitude" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>). This promise had been fulfilled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20</a>); but now the sins of the people would produce a reversal of it. It would be a remnant, <span class="accented">and only a remnant</span>, of the nation that would escape.

"Therefore will the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send consumption against his fat men; and under Asshur's glory there burns a brand like a firebrand." Three epithets are here employed to designate God according to His unlimited, all-controlling omnipotence: viz., ha&#770;'a&#770;do&#772;n, which is always used by Isaiah in connection with judicial and penal manifestations of power; and adona&#770;i zeba&#770;oth, a combination never met with again, similar to the one used in the Elohistic Psalms, Elohim zebaoth (compare, on the other hand, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-15.htm">Isaiah 3:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-23.htm">Isaiah 10:23-24</a>). Even here a large number of codices and editions (Norzi's, for example) have the reading Jehovah Zebaoth, which is customary in other cases.<p>(Note: This passage is not included in the 134 vadda&#770;'&#305;&#772;n (i.e., "real") adonai, or passages in which adonai is written, and not merely to be read, that are enumerated by the Masora (see Br's Psalterium, p. 133).)<p>Ra&#770;zo&#772;n (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-4.htm">Isaiah 17:4</a>) is one of the diseases mentioned in the catalogue of curses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-22.htm">Deuteronomy 28:22</a>. Galloping consumption comes like a destroying angel upon the great masses of flesh seen in the well-fed Assyrian magnates: mishmannim is used in a personal sense, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-31.htm">Psalm 78:31</a>. And under the glory of Asshur, i.e., its richly equipped army (ca&#770;bo&#772;d as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>), He who makes His angels flames of fire places fire so as to cause it to pass away in flames. In accordance with Isaiah's masterly art of painting in tones, the whole passage is so expressed, that we can hear the crackling, and spluttering, and hissing of the fire, as it seizes upon everything within its reach. This fire, whatever it may be so far as its natural and phenomenal character is concerned, is in its true essence the wrath of Jehovah. </body></html>
