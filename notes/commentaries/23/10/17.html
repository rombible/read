I would go through them, I would burn them together.">Isaiah 27:4</a>) to the enemies of Israel, is to Israel itself as the very light of life. The “briars and thorns” (we note the recurrence of the combination of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-18.htm" title="For wickedness burns as the fire: it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke.">Isaiah 9:18</a>) are the host of the Assyrian army (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-6.htm" title="But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:">2Samuel 23:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-6.htm" title="And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with you, and you do dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.">Ezekiel 2:6</a>), as “the glory of his forest” in the next verse are the captains and princes. The emphatic “in one day” points to some great catastrophe, such as that which afterwards destroyed the army of Sennacherib.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/isaiah/10.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Isaiah<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">LIGHT OR FIRE?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-17.htm" title="And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;">Isaiah 10:17</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> With grand poetry the prophet pictures the Assyrian power as a forest consumed like thistles and briers by the fire of God. The text suggests solemn truths about the divine Nature and its manifestations.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The Essential Character of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Light and Holiness are substantially parallel. Light symbolises purity, but also knowledge and joy. Holiness is Separation from Creatures, but chiefly from their Evils.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The Different Attitudes which Men assume to that Character.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Light of <span class="ital">Israel</span>’: ‘<span class="ital">His</span> Holy One.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> God becomes ours, and we have an interest in that radiant Personality if we choose to claim it by faith, love, and obedience. We are free to accept God as ours or to reject Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The Opposite Aspects which that Character accordingly assumes.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{a} The self-same divine Character has two effects according to the character of the beholder.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> To those who respond to God’s love it is-heaven. To those who are indifferent or alienated it may be pain, and will harm them if they see it and do not yield to it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> God’s holiness is not retributive justice but moral perfectness, which to a good man will be joy, and to a bad man, intolerable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The light which is gladsome to a healthy eye is agony to a diseased one.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{b} All the manifestations and operations of that divine Character have a twofold aspect. Christ is either a stone of stumbling or a sure foundation. Men are either the better or the worse for Him. The Gospel is the savour of life unto life or of death unto death. The tremendous ‘either-or.’ The Cross rejected harms the moral nature, hardens conscience, deepens condemnation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> All divine operations are necessarily on the side of God’s lovers and against those who love Him not. They are contrary to Him, therefore He is so to them. ‘With the froward Thou wilt show Thyself froward.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The final Judgment will be either rapture or despair, like the coming of a bridegroom, or the fiery rain that burnt up Sodom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The very dew of Heavenly Bliss would be corroding poison to a godless spirit.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:5-19 See what a change sin made. The king of Assyria, in his pride, thought to act by his own will. The tyrants of the world are tools of Providence. God designs to correct his people for their hypocrisy, and bring them nearer to him; but is that Sennacherib's design? No; he designs to gratify his own covetousness and ambition. The Assyrian boasts what great things he has done to other nations, by his own policy and power. He knows not that it is God who makes him what he is, and puts the staff into his hand. He had done all this with ease; none moved the wing, or cried as birds do when their nests are rifled. Because he conquered Samaria, he thinks Jerusalem would fall of course. It was lamentable that Jerusalem should have set up graven images, and we cannot wonder that she was excelled in them by the heathen. But is it not equally foolish for Christians to emulate the people of the world in vanities, instead of keeping to things which are their special honour? For a tool to boast, or to strive against him that formed it, would not be more out of the way, than for Sennacherib to vaunt himself against Jehovah. When God brings his people into trouble, it is to bring sin to their remembrance, and humble them, and to awaken them to a sense of their duty; this must be the fruit, even the taking away of sin. When these points are gained by the affliction, it shall be removed in mercy. This attempt upon Zion and Jerusalem should come to nothing. God will be as a fire to consume the workers of iniquity, both soul and body. The desolation should be as when a standard-bearer fainteth, and those who follow are put to confusion. Who is able to stand before this great and holy Lord God?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the light of Israel - That is, Yahweh. The word "light" here, &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;  'o&#770;r, is used also to denote a "fire," or that which causes light and heat; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-2.htm">Ezekiel 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-16.htm">Isaiah 44:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-14.htm">Isaiah 47:14</a>. Here it is used in the same sense, denoting that Yahweh would be "the fire" &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;  'o&#770;r that would cause the "flame" (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;  'e&#770;sh) which would consume the Assyrian. Jehovah is often compared to a burning flame, or fire; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-3.htm">Deuteronomy 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>.<p>Shall be for a fire - By his power and his judgment he shall destroy them.<p>His Holy One - Israel's Holy One; that is, Yahweh - often called in the Scriptures the Holy One of Israel.<p>And it shall burn - That is, the flame that Yahweh shall kindle, or his judgments that he shall send forth.<p>And devour his thorns and his briers - An expression denoting the utter impotency of all the mighty armies of the Assyrian to resist Yahweh. As dry thorns and briers cannot resist the action of heat, so certainly and speedily would the armies of Sennacherib be destroyed before Yahweh; compare the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-18.htm">Isaiah 9:18</a>. Lowth supposes, that by 'briers and thorns' here, the common soldiers of the army are intended, and by 'the glory of his forest' <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-18.htm">Isaiah 10:18</a>, the princes, officers, and nobles.

A new name of God. The idea on which it is based may be found in the Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a>), and again in Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-19.htm">Isaiah 60:19</a>). God enlightens his people, cheers them, comforts them spiritually, as the light of the sun enlightens, cheers, and comforts men physically.

Scarcely "in one battle" (Cheyne); for the destruction of Assyria was effected by many battles, many sieges, and much exhausting ravage. "In one day" rather means "at one and the same time,"  "within a brief space." It is not to he taken literally. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Asshur was to be an instrument of divine wrath upon all Israel; but it would exalt itself, and make itself the end instead of the means. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-7.htm">Isaiah 10:7</a> "Nevertheless he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; for it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few." Asshur did not think so (lo'-ce&#772;n), i.e., not as he ought to think, seeing that his power over Israel was determined by Jehovah Himself. For what filled his heart was the endeavour, peculiar to the imperial power, to destroy not a few nations, i.e., as many nations as possible, for the purpose of extending his own dominions, and with the determination to tolerate no other independent nation, and the desire to deal with Judah as with all the rest. For Jehovah was nothing more in his esteem than one of the idols of the nations. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-8.htm">Isaiah 10:8-11</a> "For he saith, Are not my generals all kings? Is not Calno as Carchemish, or Hamath as Arpad, or Samaria as Damascus? As my hand hath reached the kingdoms of the idols, and their graven images were more than those of Jerusalem and Samaria; shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, do likewise to Jerusalem and her idols?" The king of Asshur bore the title of the great king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-4.htm">Isaiah 36:4</a>), and indeed, as we may infer from <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-7.htm">Ezekiel 26:7</a>, that of the king of kings. The generals in his army he could call kings,<p>(Note: The question is expressed in Hebrew phraseology, since sar in Assyrian was a superior title to that of melek, as we may see from inscriptions and proper names.)<p>because the satraps<p>(Note: Satrapes is the old Persian (arrow-headed) khshatra (Sanscr. xatra) pa&#770;van, i.e., keeper of government. Pa&#770;van (nom. pa&#770;va&#770;), which occurs in the Zendik as an independent word pavan (nom. pavao) in the sense of sentry or watchman, is probably the original of the Hebrew pecha&#770;h (see Spiegel, in Kohler on <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-8.htm">Malachi 1:8</a>).)<p>who led their several contingents were equal to kings in the extent and splendour of their government, and some of them were really conquered kings (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-28.htm">2 Kings 25:28</a>). He proudly asks whether every one of the cities named has not been as incapable as the rest, of offering a successful resistance to him. Carchemish is the later Circesium (Cercusium), at the junction of the Chaboras with the Euphrates (see above); Calno, the later Ctesiphon, on the left bank of the Tigris; Arpad (according to Mershid, i. p. 47, in the pashalic of Chaleb, i.e., Aleppo) and Hamath (i.e., Epiphania) were Syrian cities, the latter on the river Orontes, still a large and wealthy place. The king of Asshur had also already conquered Samaria, at the time when the prophet introduced him as uttering these words. Jerusalem, therefore, would be unable to resist him. As he had obtained possession of idolatrous kingdoms (&#1500; &#1502;&#1506;&#1488;, to reach, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-9.htm">Psalm 21:9</a> : ha&#770;-'elil with the article indicating the genus), which had more idols than Jerusalem or than Samaria; so would he also overcome Jerusalem, which had just as few and just as powerless idols as Samaria had. Observe there that <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-11.htm">Isaiah 10:11</a> is the apodosis to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-10.htm">Isaiah 10:10</a>, and that the comparative clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-10.htm">Isaiah 10:10</a> is repeated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-11.htm">Isaiah 10:11</a>, for the purpose of instituting a comparison, more especially with Samaria and Jerusalem. The king of Asshur calls the gods of the nations by the simple name of idols, though the prophet does not therefore make him speak from his own Israelitish standpoint. On the contrary, the great sin of the king of Asshur consisted in the manner in which he spoke. For since he recognised no other gods than his own Assyrian national deities, he placed Jehovah among the idols of the nations, and, what ought particularly to be observed, with the other idols, whose worship had been introduced into Samaria and Jerusalem. But in this very fact there was so far consolation for the worshippers of Jehovah, that such blasphemy of the one living God would not remain unavenged; whilst for the worshipers of idols it contained a painful lesson, since their gods really deserved nothing better than that contempt should be heaped upon them. The prophet has now described the sin of Asshur. It was ambitious self-exaltation above Jehovah, amounting even to blasphemy. And yet he was only the staff of Jehovah, who could make use of him as He would. </body></html>
