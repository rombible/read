There was another rod prominent in that Egyptian history besides that of the oppressor, and that rod had been wielded by the deliverer.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:20-34 By our afflictions we may learn not to make creatures our confidence. Those only can with comfort stay upon God, who return to him in truth, not in pretence and profession only. God will justly bring this wasting away on a provoking people, but will graciously set bounds to it. It is against the mind and will of God, that his people, whatever happens, should give way to fear. God's anger against his people is but for a moment; and when that is turned from us, we need not fear the fury of man. The rod with which he corrected his people, shall not only be laid aside, but thrown into the fire. To encourage God's people, the prophet puts them in mind of what God had formerly done against the enemies of his church. God's people shall be delivered from the Assyrians. Some think it looks to the deliverance of the Jews out of their captivity; and further yet, to the redemption of believers from the tyranny of sin and Satan. And this, because of the anointing; for his people Israel's sake, the believers among them that had received the unction of Divine grace. And for the sake of the Messiah, the Anointed of God. Here is, ver. 28-34, a prophetical description of Sennacherib's march towards Jerusalem, when he threatened to destroy that city. Then the Lord, in whom Hezekiah trusted, cut down his army like the hewing of a forest. Let us apply what is here written, to like matters in other ages of the church of Christ. Because of the anointing of our great Redeemer, the yoke of every antichrist must be broken from off his church: and if our souls partake of the unction of the Holy Spirit, complete and eternal deliverances will be secured to us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the Lord of hosts shall stir up - Or shall raise up that which shall rove as a scourge to him.<p>A scourge for him - That is, that which shall punish him. The scourge, or rod, is used to denote severe punishment of any kind. The nature of this punishment is immediately specified.<p>According to the slaughter of Midian - That is, as the Midianites were discomfitcd and punished. There is reference here, doubtless, to the discomfiture and slaughter of the Midianites by Gideon, as recorded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/7-24.htm">Judges 7:24-25</a>. That was signal and entire; and the prophet means to say, that the destruction of the Assyrian would be also signal and total. The country of Midian, or Madian, was on the east side of the Elanitic branch of the Red Sea; but it extended also north along the desert of mount Seir to the country of the Moabites; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-6.htm">Isaiah 60:6</a>.<p>At the rock of Oreb - At this rock, Gideon killed the two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-25.htm">Judges 7:25</a>; and from this circumstance, probably, the name was given to the rock: <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-15.htm">Leviticus 11:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-14.htm">Deuteronomy 14:14</a>. It was on the east side of the Jordan.<p>And as his rod ... - That is, as God punished the Egyptians in the Red Sea.<p>So shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt - As God overthrew the Egyptians in the Red Sea, so shall he overthrow and destroy the Assyrian. By these two comparisons, therefore, the prophet represents the complete destruction of the Assyrian army. In both of these cases, the enemies of the Jews had been completely overthrown, and so it would be in regard to the hosts of the Assyrian. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. slaughter of&#8212;"stroke upon."<p>Midian&#8212;(Isa 9:4; Jud 7:25).<p>as his rod was upon the sea&#8212;rather, understanding "stroke" from the previous clause, "according to the stroke of His rod upon the Red Sea" (Ex 14:16, 26).

The Assyrian monarch; this scourge stirred up or awakened by the Lord, with which that monarch was severely scourged, is no other than the angel that was sent of God to destroy his army, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>, <p>according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: this refers to the destruction of the Midianites in the time of Gideon; and suggests, that the slaughter of the Assyrians should be like that, as it was; for as that was in the night, and very general, and immediately from the hand of the Lord, and was unthought of, and unexpected, and such of their princes that fled were taken and slain, particularly Oreb, at the rock which took its name from him; for not mount Horeb, and the rock there smitten by Moses, are meant, which is written with different letters; see the history of this in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-19.htm">Judges 7:19</a> so it was in the night when the Assyrian army was destroyed, and that wholly; and not by the Israelites, but by the Angel of the Lord; and at once, at an unawares; and though Sennacherib fled and escaped, he was slain by his own sons, in his own city, in the temple of his god, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>, <p>and as his rod was upon the sea; referring to Moses's rod, which was lifted up, by the order of the Lord, over the Red Sea, when the Egyptians were drowned: <p>so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt; and destroy the Assyrians, in like manner as he destroyed the Egyptians, all at once. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD of hosts shall raise up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of <span class="cverse3">{t}</span> Midian at the rock of Oreb: and <i>as</i> his rod <i>was</i> upon the <span class="cverse3">{u}</span> sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.</span><p>(t) Read Isa 9:4.<p>(u) When the Israelites passed through by the lifting up of Moses' rod, and the enemies were drowned, Ex 14:28.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord... shall stir up a scourge for him</span>; or, <span class="accented">lift up a scourge over him</span>. Isaiah uses the metaphor of the "scourge" again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16, 18</a>. It is rare in Scripture, though common among the Greek and Latin writers. <span class="cmt_word">According to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-4.htm">Isaiah 9:4</a>). The "slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb" was that great destruction of the Midianites which was begun by the three hundred under Gideon, and completed by the men of Ephraim, whereof we have an account in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-19.htm">Judges 7:19-25</a>. Its counterpart in Assyrian history would seem to be the destruction of Sennacherib's army, as related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>. <span class="cmt_word">As his rod was upon the sea</span>. An allusion to the drowning of Pharaoh's host in the Red Sea. This was a nearer parallel to the destruction of Sennacherib's army than the slaughter of the Midianites, since it was wholly miraculous. By "his rod" we may understand the rod of Moses, endued by God with miraculous powers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-3.htm">Exodus 4:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-16.htm">Exodus 14:16, 27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">After the manner of Egypt</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "after the manner of his action in Egypt." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And it will come to pass in that day, the remnant of Israel, and that which has escaped of the house of Jacob, will not continue to stay itself upon its chastiser, and will stay itself upon Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, in truth." Behind the judgment upon Asshur there lies the restoration of Israel. "The chastiser" was the Assyrian. While relying upon this, Israel received strokes, because Jehovah made Israel's staff into its rod. But henceforth it would sanctify the Holy One of Israel, putting its trust in Him and not in man, and that purely and truly (be'emeth, "in truth"), not with fickleness and hypocrisy. Then would be fulfilled the promise contained in the name Shear-yashub, after the fulfilment of the threat that it contained. </body></html>
