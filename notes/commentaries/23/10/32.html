Those only can with comfort stay upon God, who return to him in truth, not in pretence and profession only. God will justly bring this wasting away on a provoking people, but will graciously set bounds to it. It is against the mind and will of God, that his people, whatever happens, should give way to fear. God's anger against his people is but for a moment; and when that is turned from us, we need not fear the fury of man. The rod with which he corrected his people, shall not only be laid aside, but thrown into the fire. To encourage God's people, the prophet puts them in mind of what God had formerly done against the enemies of his church. God's people shall be delivered from the Assyrians. Some think it looks to the deliverance of the Jews out of their captivity; and further yet, to the redemption of believers from the tyranny of sin and Satan. And this, because of the anointing; for his people Israel's sake, the believers among them that had received the unction of Divine grace. And for the sake of the Messiah, the Anointed of God. Here is, ver. 28-34, a prophetical description of Sennacherib's march towards Jerusalem, when he threatened to destroy that city. Then the Lord, in whom Hezekiah trusted, cut down his army like the hewing of a forest. Let us apply what is here written, to like matters in other ages of the church of Christ. Because of the anointing of our great Redeemer, the yoke of every antichrist must be broken from off his church: and if our souls partake of the unction of the Holy Spirit, complete and eternal deliverances will be secured to us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As yet shall he remain - This is still a description of his advancing toward Jerusalem. He would make a station at Nob and remain there a day, meaning, perhaps, "only" one day, such would be his impatience to attack and destroy Jerusalem.<p>At Nob - Nob was a city of Benjamin, inhabited by priests; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-32.htm">Nehemiah 11:32</a>. When David was driven away by Saul, he came to this city, and received supplies from Ahimelech the priest; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-1.htm">1 Samuel 21:1-6</a>. Nob must have been situated somewhere upon the ridge of the mount of Olives, to the northeast of the city. So Jerome, professedly from Hebrew tradition, says, 'Stans in oppidulo Nob et procul urbem conspiciens Jerusalem.' - "Commentary in loc." Messrs. Robinson and Smith sought all along the ridge of the mount of Olives, from the Damascus road to the summit opposite to the city, for some traces of an ancient site which might be regarded as the place of Nob; but without the slightest success. - "Bib. Researches," ii. p. 150.<p>He shall shake his hand - That is, in the attitude of menace, or threatening. This language implies, that the city of Nob was so near to Jerusalem that the latter city could be seen from it; and the description denotes, that at the sight of Jerusalem Sennacherib would be full of indignation, and utter against it the threat of speedy and complete ruin.<p>The mount of the daughter of Zion - See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>. The Chaldee renders this, 'He shall come, and stand in Nob, the city of the priests, over against the wall of Jerusalem, and shall answer and say to his army, "Is not this that city of Jerusalem against which I have assembled all my armies, and on account of which I have made an exaction on all my provinces? And lo, it is less and more feeble than any of the defenses of the people which I have subjected in the strength of my hand." Over against that he shall stand, and shake his head, and shall bring his hand against the mount of the sanctuary which is Zion, and against the court which is in Jerusalem.' Jarchi and Kimchi say, that Nob was so near to Jerusalem that it could be seen from thence; and hence, this is mentioned as the last station of the army of the Assyrian, the end of his march, and where the prize seemed to be within his grasp. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32. that day&#8212;literally, "As yet this (one only) day (is allowed to the soldiers) for remaining (halting for rest) at Nob"; northeast of Jerusalem on Olivet; a town of the priests (Ne 11:32).<p>daughter&#8212;rightly substituted for the Chetib reading, house. His "shaking his hand" in menace implies that he is now at Nob, within sight of Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He shall shake his hand, </span> by way of commination.

The same day he came from Gebim; and proceed no further as yet, but make a short stay, and prepare himself and army to march to Jerusalem the next day: the Jews say (l), that he performed all his journeys in one day; the same day he came to Ajath he came to Nob, where he stayed the remaining part of the day. Nob was a city of the priests, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-19.htm">1 Samuel 22:19</a> and so it is called in the Targum here; it was so near Jerusalem, that, as Jarchi and Kimchi say, it might be seen from hence; wherefore here he stood, in sight of Jerusalem; against the wall of it, the Targum says; and did as follows: <p>he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem; threatening what he would do to it, and despising it as unable to hold out against him; or the sense is this, yet a day, or in a day's time, from the last place where he was; he shall come to Nob, and there shall he stop, and go no further: or, "the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem, shall shake its hand"; bidding him defiance, insulting over him, or rejoicing at the fall of the Assyrian army.

Nob (1 Samuel 21, 1 Samuel 22; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-32.htm" title="And at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,">Nehemiah 11:32</a>) must be sought in the immediate vicinity of Jerusalem, but its site has not yet been ascertained. The most probable conjecture is that it was on the height of Scopus overlooking the city from the north.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As yet shall he remain at Nob that day</span>; literally, <span class="accented">yet that day</span> (<span class="accented">is he</span>) <span class="accented">at Nob to halt</span>. The Assyrians pitch their camp at Nob, the priestly city destroyed by Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-19.htm">1 Samuel 22:19</a>), 1 which was evidently within sight of Jerusalem. Major Wilson's conjecture, that it occupied the site of the later Scopus, is probable. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A still further reason is given for the elevating words, with a resumption of the grounds of consolation upon which they were founded. "For yet a very little the indignation is past, and my wrath turns to destroy them: and Jehovah of hosts moves the whip over it, as He smote Midian at the rock of Oreb; and His staff stretches out over the sea, and He lifts it up in the manner of Egypt." The expression "a very little" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-14.htm">Isaiah 16:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-17.htm">Isaiah 29:17</a>) does not date from the actual present, when the Assyrian oppressions had not yet begun, but from the ideal present, when they were threatening Israel with destruction. The indignation of Jehovah would then suddenly come to an end (ca&#770;la&#770;h za&#8219;am, borrowed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-36.htm">Daniel 11:36</a>, and to be interpreted in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20</a>); and the wrath of Jehovah would be, or go, &#8219;al-tabiltha&#770;m. Luzzatto recommends the following emendation of the text, &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500; &#1493;&#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;, "and my wrath against the world will cease," te&#772;be&#772;l being used, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-17.htm">Isaiah 14:17</a>, with reference to the oikoumenon as enslaved by the imperial power. But the received text gives a better train of thought, if we connect it with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-26.htm">Isaiah 10:26</a>. We must not be led astray, however, by the preposition &#8219;al, and take the words as meaning, My wrath (burneth) over the destruction inflicted by Asshur upon the people of God, or the destruction endured by the latter. It is to the destruction of the Assyrians that the wrath of Jehovah is now directed; &#8219;al being used, as it frequently is, to indicate the object upon which the eye is fixed, or to which the intention points (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-8.htm">Psalm 32:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-42.htm">Psalm 18:42</a>). With this explanation <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-25.htm">Isaiah 10:25</a> leads on to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-26.htm">Isaiah 10:26</a>. The destruction of Asshur is predicted there in two figures drawn from occurrences in the olden time. The almighty Judge would swing the whip over Asshur (&#8219;orer, agitare, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-18.htm">2 Samuel 23:18</a>), and smite it, as Midian was once smitten. The rock of Oreb is the place where the Ephraimites slew the Midianitish king 'Oreb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-25.htm">Judges 7:25</a>). His staff would then be over the sea, i.e., would be stretched out, like the wonder-working staff of Moses, over the sea of affliction, into which the Assyrians had driven Israel (ya&#770;m, the sea, an emblem borrowed from the type; see Kohler on <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-11.htm">Zechariah 10:11</a>, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-6.htm">Psalm 66:6</a>); and He would lift it up, commanding the waves of the sea, so that they would swallow Asshur. "In the manner of Egypt:" b'derek Mitzraim (according to Luzzatto in both instances, "on the way to Egypt," which restricts the Assyrian bondage in a most unhistorical manner to the time of the Egyptian campaign) signifies in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-24.htm">Isaiah 10:24</a>, as the Egyptians lifted it up; but here, as it was lifted up above the Egyptians. The expression is intentionally conformed to that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-24.htm">Isaiah 10:24</a> : because Asshur had lifted up the rod over Israel in the Egyptian manner, Jehovah would lift it up over Asshur in the Egyptian manner also. </body></html>
