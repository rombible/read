It is, however, quite in character with the Assyrian inscriptions that Sargon should ascribe his victories to Asshur as the Supreme God, before whose sovereignty all local deities were compelled to bow. To the Assyrian king the name of Jehovah would represent a deity whose power was to be measured by the greatness of the nation that worshipped Him, and inferior, therefore, to the gods of Carchemish or Hamath. The worship of Baal, Moloch, and other deities, in both Israel and Judah, had of course tended to strengthen this estimate. (Comp. Rabshakeh’s language in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/36-18.htm" title="Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, the LORD will deliver us. Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?">Isaiah 36:18-19</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:5-19 See what a change sin made. The king of Assyria, in his pride, thought to act by his own will. The tyrants of the world are tools of Providence. God designs to correct his people for their hypocrisy, and bring them nearer to him; but is that Sennacherib's design? No; he designs to gratify his own covetousness and ambition. The Assyrian boasts what great things he has done to other nations, by his own policy and power. He knows not that it is God who makes him what he is, and puts the staff into his hand. He had done all this with ease; none moved the wing, or cried as birds do when their nests are rifled. Because he conquered Samaria, he thinks Jerusalem would fall of course. It was lamentable that Jerusalem should have set up graven images, and we cannot wonder that she was excelled in them by the heathen. But is it not equally foolish for Christians to emulate the people of the world in vanities, instead of keeping to things which are their special honour? For a tool to boast, or to strive against him that formed it, would not be more out of the way, than for Sennacherib to vaunt himself against Jehovah. When God brings his people into trouble, it is to bring sin to their remembrance, and humble them, and to awaken them to a sense of their duty; this must be the fruit, even the taking away of sin. When these points are gained by the affliction, it shall be removed in mercy. This attempt upon Zion and Jerusalem should come to nothing. God will be as a fire to consume the workers of iniquity, both soul and body. The desolation should be as when a standard-bearer fainteth, and those who follow are put to confusion. Who is able to stand before this great and holy Lord God?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The argument in these two verses is this: 'The nations which I have subdued were professedly under the protection of idol gods. Yet those idols were not able to defend them - though stronger than the gods worshipped by Jerusalem and Samaria. And is there any probability, therefore, that the protection on which you who are Jews are leaning, will be able to deliver you?' Jerusalem he regarded as an idolatrous city, like others; and as all others had hitherto been unable to retard his movements, he inferred that it would be so with Jerusalem. This is, therefore, the confident boasting of "a man" who regarded himself as able to vanquish all "the gods" that the nations worshipped. The same confident boasting he uttered when he sent messengers to Hezekiah; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-12.htm">2 Kings 19:12</a> : 'Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my father destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden, which were in Thelasar?' <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-18.htm">Isaiah 36:18-20</a> : 'Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? Where are the gods of Hamath and of Arphad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? And have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?'<p>Hath found - That is, 'I have found them unable to defend themselves by their trust in their idols, and have subdued them.'<p>The kingdoms of the idols - The kingdoms that worship idols.<p>And whose graven images - That is, whose idols; or whose representations of the gods. The word properly signifies that which is hewn or cut out; and then the block of wood, or stone, that is carved into an image of the god. Here it, refers to the gods themselves, probably, as having been found to be impotent, though he supposed them to be more powerful that those of Jerusalem and Samaria.<p>Did excel - Hebrew, 'More than Jerusalem,' where the inseperable preposition &#1502;  m, is used to denote comparison. They were "more" to be dreaded; or more mighty than those of Jerusalem.<p>Of Jerusalem - Jerusalem and Samaria had often been guilty of the worship of idols; and it is probable that Sennacherib regarded them as idolaters in the same sense as other nations. They had given occasion for this suspicion by their having often fallen into idolatrous habits; and the Assyrian monarch did not regard them as in any manner distinguished from surrounding nations. It is not improbable that he was aware that Jerusalem worshipped Yahweh (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-20.htm">Isaiah 36:20</a>); but he doubtless regarded Yahweh as a mere tutelary divinity - the special god of that land, as Baal, Ashtaroth, etc., were of the countries in which they were adored. For it was a common doctrine among ancient idolaters, that each nation had its special god; that the claims of that god were to be respected and regarded in that nation; and that thus all nations should worship their own gods undisturbed. Yahweh was thus regarded as the tutelary god of the Jewish nation. The sin of Sennacherib consisted in confounding Yahweh with false gods, and in then setting him at defiance.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10, 11. found&#8212;unable to resist me: hath overcome (so Ps 21:8).<p>and whose&#8212;rather, "and their."

It is quite in accordance with Assyrian ideas that the conquered countries should be called "kingdoms of the idols" (literally, "no gods"). The Assyrian monarchs regarded their own gods as alone really deserving of the name, and made war very much with the object of proving the superiority of their deities over those of their neighbors. Hence their practice of carrying off the idols from the various cities which they conquered, or else of inscribing on them "the praises of Asshur." <span class="cmt_word">And whose graven images</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and their graven images</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Did excel</span>. In preciousness of material or in workmanship, or both. The Assyrians went near to identifying the idols with the gods themselves. <span class="cmt_word">Those of Jerusalem and of Samaria</span>. The chief Samaritan idols were the golden calves at Dan and Bethel; but, in addition to these, "images and groves were set up in every high hill and under every green tree" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10</a>), images of Baal, and Ashtoreth, and perhaps Beltis, and Chemosh, and Moloch. Even in Judah and in Jerusalem itself there were idols. Ahaz "made molten images for Baalim" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-2.htm">2 Chronicles 28:2</a>). The brazen serpent was worshipped as an idol at Jerusalem until Hezekiah destroyed it; and probably, even after the reformation of Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>), many Jews retained privately the images, which he required them to destroy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-1.htm">2 Chronicles 31:1</a>). Isaiah had already declared, speaking of Judah rather than of Israel, "Their land is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-8.htm">Isaiah 2:8</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Strophe 4. "Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and to the writers who prepare trouble to force away the needy from demanding justice, and to rob the suffering of my people of their rightful claims, that widows may become their prey, and they plunder orphans! And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the storm that cometh from afar? To whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye deposit your glory? There is nothing left but to bow down under prisoners, and they fall under the slain. With all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still." This last strophe is directed against the unjust authorities and judges. The woe pronounced upon them is, as we have already frequently seen, Isaiah's Ceterum censeo. Cha&#770;kak is their decisive decree (not, however, in a denominative sense, but in the primary sense of hewing in, recording in official documents, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-8.htm">Isaiah 30:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-23.htm">Job 19:23</a>); and Citte&#772;b (piel only occurring here, and a perfect, according to Gesenius, 126, 3) their official signing and writing. Their decrees are Chikeke&#772; 'aven (an open plural, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/5-15.htm">Judges 5:15</a>, for Chukke&#772;, after the analogy of &#1490;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;, &#1506;&#1502;&#1502;&#1497;, with an absolute Cha&#774;ka&#770;kim underlying it: Ewald, 186-7), inasmuch as their contents were worthlessness, i.e., the direct opposite of morality; and what they wrote out was &#8219;a&#770;ma&#770;l, trouble, i.e., an unjust oppression of the people (compare &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; and &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;).<p>(Note: The current accentuation, &#1493;&#1502;&#1499;&#1514;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; mercha, &#1506;&#1502;&#1500; tiphchah, is wrong. The true accentuation would be the former with tiphchah (and metheg), the latter with mercha; for &#8219;a&#770;ma&#770;l citte&#772;bu is an attributive (an elliptical relative) clause. According to its etymon, &#8219;a&#770;ma&#770;l seems to stand by the side of &#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, moles, molestus (see Pott in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, ix. 202); but within the Semitic itself it stands by the side of &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;, to fade, marcescere, which coincides with the Sanscrit root mla&#770; and its cognates (see Leo Meyer, Vergleichende Grammatik, i. 353), so that &#8219;a&#770;ma&#770;l is, strictly speaking, to wear out or tire out (vulg. to worry).)<p>Poor persons who wanted to commence legal proceedings were not even allowed to do so, and possessions to which widows and orphans had a well-founded claim were a welcome booty to them (for the diversion into the finite verb, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-11.htm">Isaiah 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-5.htm">Isaiah 49:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-5.htm">Isaiah 58:5</a>). For all this they could not escape the judgment of God. This is announced to them in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-3.htm">Isaiah 10:3</a>, in the form of three distinct questions (commencing with u&#772;ma&#770;h, quid igitur). The noun pekuddah in the first question always signifies simply a visitation of punishment; sho'a&#770;h is a confused, dull, desolate rumbling, hence confusion (turba), desolation: here it is described as "coming from afar," because a distant nation (Asshur) was the instrument of God's wrath. Second question: "Upon whom will ye throw yourselves in your search for help then" (nu&#772;s &#8219;al, a constr. praegnans, only met with here)? Third question: "Where, i.e., in whose hand, will ye deposit your wealth in money and possessions" (ca&#770;bo&#772;d, what is weighty in value and imposing in appearance); &#8219;a&#770;zab with b'yad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/39-6.htm">Genesis 39:6</a>), or with Lamed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-14.htm">Job 39:14</a>), to leave anything with a person as property in trust. No one would relieve them of their wealth, and hold it as a deposit; it was irrecoverably lost. To this negative answer there is appended the following bilti, which, when used as a preposition after a previous negation, signifies praeter; when used as a conjunction, nisi (bilti 'im, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-14.htm">Judges 7:14</a>); and where it governs the whole sentence, as in this case, nisi quod (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-6.htm">Numbers 11:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-18.htm">Daniel 11:18</a>). In the present instance, where the previous negation is to be supplied in thought, it has the force of nil reliquum est nisi quod (there is nothing left but). The singular verb (ca&#770;ra&#8219;) is used contemptuously, embracing all the high persons as one condensed mass; and tachath does not mean aeque ac or loco (like, or in the place of), as Ewald (217, k) maintains, but is used in the primary and local sense of infra (below). Some crouch down to find room at the feet of the prisoners, who are crowded closely together in the prison; or if we suppose the prophet to have a scene of transportation in his mind, they sink down under the feet of the other prisoners, in their inability to bear such hardships, whilst the rest fall in war; and as the slaughter is of long duration, not only become corpses themselves, but are covered with corpses of the slain (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>). And even with this the wrath of God is not satisfied. The prophet, however, does not follow out the terrible gradation any further. Moreover, the captivity, to which this fourth strophe points, actually formed the conclusion of a distinct period. </body></html>
