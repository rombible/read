The “signal” is, as before, “the root of Jesse,” and the exiles gather round it. In the Hebrew the “outcasts” are men, and the “dispersed” are women, the prophet thus implying that in the case of both Israel and Judah both sexes should alike be sharers in the blessings of restoration.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:10-16 When the gospel should be publicly preached, the Gentiles would seek Christ Jesus as their Lord and Saviour, and find rest of soul. When God's time is come for the deliverance of his people, mountains of opposition shall become plains before him. God can soon turn gloomy days into glorious ones. And while we expect the Lord to gather his ancient people, and bring them home to his church, also to bring in the fulness of the Gentiles, when all will be united in holy love, let us tread the highway of holiness he has made for his redeemed. Let us wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life, looking to him to prepare our way through death, that river which separates this world from the eternal world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he shall set up an ensign - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a>. The Messiah shall stand in view of the nations, as a standard is erected by a military leader. An ensign or standard was usually lifted up on the mountains or on some elevated place (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-3.htm">Isaiah 18:3</a>); and the meaning here is, that the Messiah would be the conspicuous object around which the nations would rally.<p>And shall assemble - This word, &#1488;&#1505;&#1507;  'a&#770;saph, properly means, to gather, collect, to assemble together, as fruits are collected for preservation <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-10.htm">Exodus 23:10</a>; to collect a people together <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-16.htm">Numbers 21:16</a>; to gather or collect gold; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-4.htm">2 Kings 22:4</a>. It may also mean to gather or collect anything for destruction <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a>; and hence, to take out of the way, to kill, destroy; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-6.htm">1 Samuel 15:6</a>. Here, it is evidently synonymous with the word 'recover' in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a>. It cannot be proved that it means that God will "literally" re-assemble all the scattered Jews, for the "collecting them," or regathering them to himself "as his people," though they may be still scattered among the nations, is all that the words necessarily imply. Thus when the word is used, as it is repeatedly, to denote the death of the patriarchs, where it is said they were 'gathered to their fathers,' it does not mean that they were buried in the same grave, or the same vicinity, but that they were united to them in death; they partook of the same lot; they all alike went down to the dead; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-29.htm">Genesis 35:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-29.htm">Genesis 49:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-24.htm">Numbers 20:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-50.htm">Deuteronomy 32:50</a>.<p>The outcasts of Israel - The name 'Israel,' applied at first to all the descendants of Jacob, came at length to denote the 'kingdom of Israel,' or of the 'ten tribes,' or of 'Ephraim,' as the tribes which revolted under Jeroboam were called. In this sense it is used in the Scriptures after the time of Jeroboam, and thus it acquired a technical signification, distinguishing it from Judah.<p>The dispersed of Judah - 'Judah,' also, though often used in a general sense to denote the Jews as such, without reference to the distinction in tribes, is also used technically to denote the kingdom of Judah, as distinguished from the kingdom of Israel. The tribe of Judah was much larger than Benjamin, and the name of the latter was lost in the former. A considerable part of the ten tribes returned again to their own land, with those of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin; a portion remained still in the countries of the East, and were intermingled with the other Jews who remained there. All distinctions of the tribes were gradually abolished, and there is no reason to think that the 'ten tribes,' here referred to by the name 'Israel,' have now anywhere a distinct and separate existence; see this point fully proved in a review of Dr. Grant's work on '" The Nestorians, or, the Lost Ten tribes,"' in the "Bib. Rep." for October 1841, and January 1842, by Prof. Robinson. The literal meaning here then would be, that he would gather the remains of those scattered people, whether pertaining to 'Israel' or 'Judah,' from the regions where they were dispersed.<p>It does not necessarily mean that they would be regathered in their distinctive capacity as 'Israel' and 'Judah,' or that the distinction would be still preserved, but that the people of God would be gathered together, and that all sources of alienation and discord would cease. The meaning, probably, is, that under the Messiah all the remains of that scattered people, in all parts of the earth, whether originally pertaining to 'Israel' or 'Judah,' should be collected into one spiritual kingdom, constituting one happy and harmonious people. To the fulfillment of this, it is not necessary to be supposed that they would be literally gathered into one place, or that they would be restored to their own land, or that they would be preserved as a distinct and separate community. The leading idea is, that the Messiah would set up a glorious kingdom in which all causes of alienation and discord would cease.<p>From the four corners of the earth - Chaldee, 'From the four winds of the earth.' The Septuagint renders it, 'From the four wings (&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  pterugo&#772;n) of the earth.' It means, that they should be collected to God from each of the four parts of the earth - the east, the west, the north, and the south. The Hebrew word rendered here 'corners,' means properly "wings." It is applied, however, to the corner, or border of a thing, as a skirt, or mantle <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-5.htm">1 Samuel 24:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-11.htm">1 Samuel 24:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-1.htm">Deuteronomy 23:1</a>; and hence, to the boundaries, or corners of the earth, because the earth seems to have been represented as a quadrangular plain; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-2.htm">Ezekiel 7:2</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. In the first restoration Judah alone was restored, with perhaps some few of Israel (the ten tribes): in the future restoration both are expressly specified (Eze 37:16-19; Jer 3:18). To Israel are ascribed the "outcasts" (masculine); to Judah the "dispersed" (feminine), as the former have been longer and more utterly castaways (though not finally) than the latter (Joh 7:52). The masculine and feminine conjoined express the universality of the restoration.<p>from the four corners of the earth&#8212;Hebrew, "wings of the earth."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For the nations; </span> all nations, Jews and Gentiles, who shall then embrace the true faith and the Messiah, as was said, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-10.htm" title="And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious.">Isaiah 11:10</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The outcasts; </span> that were driven and banished out of their own land into foreign parts, as the word implies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of Israel; </span> strictly so called, or of the ten tribes, as is manifest, both from their opposition to Judah in this verse, and from the mention of Ephraim in the next verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he shall set up an ensign for the nations,....

"And the wolf dwells with the lamb, and the leopard lies down with the kid; and calf and lion and stalled ox together: a little boy drives them. And cow and bear go to the pasture; their young ones lie down together: and the lion eats shopped straw like the ox. And the suckling plays by the hole of the adder, and the weaned child stretches its hand to the pupil of the basilisk-viper. They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the land is filled with knowledge of Jehovah, like the waters covering the sea." The fathers, and such commentators as Luther, Calvin, and Vitringa, have taken all these figures from the animal world as symbolical. Modern rationalists, on the other hand, understand them literally, but regard the whole as a beautiful dream and wish. It is a prophecy, however, the realization of which is to be expected on this side of the boundary between time and eternity, and, as Paul has shown in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8.htm">Romans 8</a>, is an integral link in the predestined course of the history of salvation (Hengstenberg, Umbreit, Hofmann, Drechsler). There now reign among irrational creatures, from the greatest to the least, - even among such as are invisible, - fierce conflicts and bloodthirstiness of the most savage kind. But when the Son of David enters upon the full possession of His royal inheritance, the peace of paradise will be renewed, and all that is true in the popular legends of the golden age be realized and confirmed. This is what the prophet depicts in such lovely colours. The wolf and lamb, those two hereditary foes, will be perfectly reconciled then. The leopard will let the teazing kid lie down beside it. The lion, between the calf and stalled ox, neither seizes upon its weaker neighbour, nor longs for the fatter one. Cow and bear graze together, whilst their young ones lie side beside in the pasture. The lion no longer thirsts for blood, but contents itself, like the ox, with chopped straw. The suckling pursues its sport (pilpel of &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1506;, mulcere) by the adder's hole, and the child just weaned stretches out its hand boldly and fearlessly to me'u&#772;rath tziph&#8219;o&#772;ni. It is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-17.htm">Jeremiah 8:17</a> that tziph&#8219;o&#772;ni is the name of a species of snake. According to Aquila and the Vulgate, it is basiliskos, serpens regulus, possibly from tzaph, to pipe or hiss (Ges., Frst); for Isidorus, in his Origg. xii. 4, says, Sibilus idem est qui et regulus; sibilo enim occidit, antequam mordeat vel exurat. For the hapax leg. ha&#770;da&#770;h, the meaning dirigere, tendere, is established by the Arabic; but there is all the more uncertainty about the meaning of the hap. leg. &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;. According to the parallel &#1495;&#1512;, it seems to signify the hollow (Syr., Vulg., lxx, &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;): whether from &#1488;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;  equals  &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, from which comes &#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;; or from &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;, the light-hole (like &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;, which occurs in the Mishna, Ohaloth xiii. 1) or opening where a cavern opens to the light of day. It is probable, however, that me'u&#772;ra&#770;h refers to something that exerts an attractive influence upon the child, either the "blending of colours" (Saad. renders tziph&#8219;oni, errakas', the motley snake), or better still, the "pupil of the eye" (Targum), taking the word as a feminine of ma&#770;'o&#772;r, the light of the eye (b. Erubin 55b - the power of vision). The look of a snake, more especially of the basilisk (not merely the basilisk-lizard, but also the basilisk-viper), was supposed to have a paralyzing and bewitching influence; but now the snake will lose this pernicious power (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>), and the basilisk become so tame and harmless, as to let children handle its sparkling eyes as if they were jewels. All this, as we should say with Luthardt and Hofmann (Schriftbeweis, ii. 2, 567), is only colouring which the hand of the prophet employs, for the purpose of painting the peace of that glorified state which surpasses all possibility of description; and it is unquestionably necessary to take the thought of the promise in a spiritual sense, without adhering literally to the medium employed in expressing it. But, on the other hand, we must guard against treating the description itself as merely a drapery thrown around the actual object; whereas it is rather the refraction of the object in the mind of the prophet himself, and therefore a manifestation of the true nature of that which he actually saw. <p>But are the animals to be taken as the subject in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a> also? The subject that most naturally suggests itself is undoubtedly the animals, of which a few that are alarming and destructive to men have been mentioned just before. And the fact that they really are thought of as the subject, is confirmed by <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>, where <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a> is repeated in a compendious form. The idea that &#1497;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; requires men as the subject, is refuted by the common &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; (compare the parallel promise in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-25.htm">Ezekiel 34:25</a>, which rests upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-20.htm">Hosea 2:20</a>). That the term yashchithu can be applied to animals, is evident from <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-30.htm">Jeremiah 2:30</a>, and may be assumed as a matter of course. But if the animals are the subject, har kodshi (my holy mountain) is not Zion-Moriah, upon which wild beasts never made their home in historical times; but, as the generalizing col (all) clearly shows, the whole of the holy mountain-land of Israel: har kodshi has just this meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-13.htm">Isaiah 57:13</a> (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-54.htm">Psalm 78:54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-17.htm">Exodus 15:17</a>). The fact that peace prevails in the animal world, and also peace between man and beast, is then attributed to the universal prevalence of the knowledge of God, in consequence of which that destructive hostility between the animal world and man, by which estrangement and apostasy from God were so often punished (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-25.htm">2 Kings 17:25</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-15.htm">Ezekiel 14:15</a>, etc.: see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-24.htm">Isaiah 7:24</a>), have entirely come to an end. The meaning of "the earth" is also determined by that of "all my holy mountain." The land of Israel, the dominion of the Son of David in the more restricted sense, will be from this time forward the paradisaical centre, as it were, of the whole earth - a prelude of its future state of perfect and universal glorification (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>, "all the earth"). It has now become full of "the knowledge of Jehovah," i.e., of that experimental knowledge which consists in the fellowship of love (&#1491;&#1506;&#1492;, like &#1500;&#1491;&#1492;, is a secondary form of &#1491;&#1506;&#1514;, the more common infinitive or verbal noun from &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;: Ges. 133, 1), like the waters which cover the sea, i.e., bottom of the sea (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-14.htm">Habakkuk 2:14</a>, where la&#770;da&#8219;ath is a virtual accusative, full of that which is to be known). "Cover:" cissa&#770;h l' (like sa&#770;cac l', <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>), signifies to afford a covering to another; the Lamed is frequently introduced with a participle (in Arabic regularly) as a sign of the object (Ewald, 292, e), and the omission of the article in the case of mecassim is a natural consequence of the inverted order of the words. </body></html>
