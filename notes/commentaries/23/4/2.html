The word itself is found in the Messianic prophecies of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/23-5.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-15.htm" title="In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up to David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.">Jeremiah 33:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-8.htm" title="Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you, and your fellows that sit before you: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.">Zechariah 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm" title="And speak to him, saying, Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:">Zechariah 6:12</a>. The two latter probably inherited both the thought and the word from this passage. Here, then, if we thus interpret the words, we have the first distinct prophecy in Isaiah of a personal Messiah. He is the “Branch of Jehovah,” raised up by Him, accepted by Him. And the appearance of that Branch has as its accompaniment (the poetic parallelism here being that at once of a resemblance and of contrast) the restoration of outward fertility. That thought Isaiah had inherited from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-16.htm" title="There shall be an handful of corn in the earth on the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.">Psalm 72:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hosea/2-21.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, said the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;">Hosea 2:21-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-18.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth out of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.">Joel 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-13.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that sows seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.">Amos 9:13</a>. He transmitted it to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-27.htm" title="And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them.">Ezekiel 34:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/9-16.htm" title="And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people: for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign on his land.">Zechariah 9:16-17</a>. The interpretation which takes “the branch [or growth] of the Lord” in its lower sense, as used collectively for “vegetation,” and, therefore, parallel and all but synonymous with the “fruits of the earth,” seems to miss the true meaning. Rabbinic exegesis may be of little weight, but the acceptance of the term as Messianic by Jeremiah and Zechariah is surely conclusive. It will be noted that the prophecy of the Branch (<span class= "ital">tsemach</span>) here comes after a picture of desolation, just as that of the Branch (<span class= "ital">netzer</span>) does in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1</a>. The thought seems applied by our Lord to Himself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it stays alone: but if it die, it brings forth much fruit.">John 12:24</a>.<p><span class= "bld">For them that are escaped of Israel.</span>—These are, of course, identical with the “remnant” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-9.htm" title="Except the LORD of hosts had left to us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like to Gomorrah.">Isaiah 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-13.htm" title="But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.">Isaiah 6:13</a>, to whom the prophet had been taught to look as to the trusted depositaries of the nation’s future.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm" title="In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.">Isaiah 4:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">In that day </span>— About and after that time, <span class="ital">when the Lord shall have washed away </span>(as this time is particularly expressed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-4.htm" title="When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the middle thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.">Isaiah 4:4</a>,) <span class="ital">the filth of Zion, </span>by those dreadful judgments now described. The third part of this discourse, the reader will observe, begins here, in which is set forth the flourishing state of the remnant of the Jews after the times of the former calamity. <span class="ital">Shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious </span>— The church and people of Israel may be here intended by <span class="ital">the branch of the Lord, </span>being often called God’s <span class="ital">vine, </span>or <span class="ital">vineyard, </span>as we have seen before, and <span class="ital">the branch of his planting, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-21.htm" title="Your people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.">Isaiah 60:21</a>. It is a metaphorical expression, taken from a tree cut down, which, notwithstanding, sprouts forth anew from the root, by young suckers, and brings forth many trees. And thus the prophet foretels, that, notwithstanding the grievous calamities and great destructions which he had predicted, and which would certainly come to pass, yet, nevertheless, the small remainder of them which should return out of captivity, with those that should be left in the land, when it was laid desolate by the Chaldeans, should increase into a great people. And to them <span class="ital">the fruit of the earth </span>should be <span class="ital">excellent and comely </span>— That is, through the abundant produce of the land they should be made rich, and should be rendered respectable to the neighbouring nations. This seems to be the primary and most obvious meaning of the passage, considered in connection with what precedes and follows. The Chaldee Paraphrast, however, says, <span class="ital">the branch </span>here means <span class="ital">the Messiah of Jehovah, </span>and of him many Jewish doctors, as well as Christian commentators, understand the expression. Certainly he is frequently signified, in Scripture, by this title, <span class="ital">the branch: </span>see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-15.htm" title="In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up to David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.">Jeremiah 33:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-1.htm" title="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.">Zechariah 3:1</a>; and, in one place, namely, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm" title="And speak to him, saying, Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:">Zechariah 6:12</a>, his name is expressly said to be <span class="ital">the branch. </span>Understood of him, the meaning of the passage must be, that after the foregoing miseries had been brought upon the Jews, and they had been restored to their own land; and after they had been chastised and purified still more, by the calamities brought upon them by Antiochus Epiphanes and other princes of the Grecian empire, and by the Romans under Pompey, the Messiah should be born; and that, after the utter destruction which should be brought upon the Jewish city, temple, and nation, by Titus, the Roman general, the kingdom of the Messiah should become beautiful and glorious, as is here expressed. According to this interpretation, the expression, <span class="ital">in that day, </span>in the beginning of the verse, must be considered as used with great latitude, as it often is by this prophet, signifying, as Lowth observes, “not the same time with that which was last mentioned, but an extraordinary season, remarkable for some signal events of providence, called elsewhere, by way of excellence, <span class="ital">the day of the Lord, </span>just as <span class="ital">that day </span>denotes the day of judgment in the New Testament, as being a time of all others the most remarkable; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-10.htm" title="When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.">2 Thessalonians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-12.htm" title="For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day.">2 Timothy 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-18.htm" title="The Lord grant to him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered to me at Ephesus, you know very well.">2 Timothy 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-8.htm" title="From now on there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but to all them also that love his appearing.">2 Timothy 4:8</a>. “It is usual,” says Grotius, “for the prophets to pass from the threatenings that relate to their own times, to the promises which belong to the times of the gospel.” It may be further observed here, that the Scriptures often speak of great tribulations, as preceding, and preparing the way for, the enlargement and prosperity of Christ’s kingdom. In consistency with this application of the passage, by <span class="ital">the fruit of the earth, </span>here said to be <span class="ital">excellent and comely, </span>must be meant the spiritual blessings of the gospel, frequently described under the emblems of the fruitfulness of the earth and plenty. And by <span class="ital">them that are escaped of Israel, </span>we must understand those Jews who, the prophet foresaw, would be converted by the preaching of Christ and his apostles, and should thereby escape that vengeance which would involve the rest of their nation. This accords well with the following verses of the chapter.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:2-6 Not only the setting forth Christ's kingdom in the times of the apostles, but its enlargement by gathering the dispersed Jews into the church, is foretold. Christ is called the Branch of the Lord, being planted by his power, and flourishing to his praise. The gospel is the fruit of the Branch of the Lord; all the graces and comforts of the gospel spring from Christ. It is called the fruit of the earth, because it sprang up in this world, and was suited for the present state. It will be good evidence that we are distinguished from those merely called Israel, if we are brought to see all beauty in Christ, and holiness. As a type of this blessed day, Jerusalem should again flourish as a branch, and be blessed with the fruits of the earth. God will keep for himself a holy seed. When most of those that have a place and a name in Zion, and in Jerusalem, shall be cut off by their unbelief, some shall be left. Those only that are holy shall be left, when the Son of man shall gather out of his kingdom every thing which offends. By the judgment of God's providence, sinners were destroyed and consumed; but by the Spirit of grace they are reformed and converted. The Spirit herein acts as a Spirit of judgment, enlightening the mind, convincing the conscience; also as a Spirit of burning, quickening and strengthening the affections, and making men zealously affected in a good work. An ardent love to Christ and souls, and zeal against sin, will carry men on with resolution in endeavours to turn away ungodliness from Jacob. Every affliction serves believers as a furnace, to purify them from dross; and the convincing, enlightening, and powerful influences of the Holy Spirit, gradually root out their lusts, and render them holy as He is holy. God will protect his church, and all that belong to it. Gospel truths and ordinances are the glory of the church. Grace in the soul is the glory of it; and those that have it are kept by the power of God. But only those who are weary will seek rest; only those who are convinced that a storm is approaching, will look for shelter. Affected with a deep sense of the Divine displeasure, to which we are exposed by sin, let us at once have recourse to Jesus Christ, and thankfully accept the refuge he affords.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The branch of the Lord - &#1510;&#1502;&#1495; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;  yehova&#770;h tsemach. "The sprout" of Yahweh. This expression, and this verse, have had a great variety of interpretations. The Septuagint reads it, 'In that day God shall shine in counsel with glory upon the earth, to exalt, and to glorify the remnant of Israel.' The Chaldee renders it, 'In that day, the Messiah of the Lord shall be for joy and glory, and the doers of the law for praise and honor to those of Israel who are delivered.' It is clear that the passage is designed to denote some signal blessing that was to succeed the calamity predicted in the previous verses. The only question is, to what has the prophet reference? The word 'branch' (&#1510;&#1502;&#1495;  tsemach) is derived from the verb (&#1510;&#1502;&#1495;  tsa&#770;mach) signifying "to sprout, to spring up," spoken of plants. Hence, the word "branch" means properly that which "shoots up," or "sprouts" from the root of a tree, or from a decayed tree; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/14-7.htm">Job 14:7-9</a>.<p>The Messiah is thus said to be 'a root of Jesse,' <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-12.htm">Romans 11:12</a>; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a>, note; and 'the root and offspring of David,' <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16</a>, as being a "descendant" of Jesse; that is, as if Jesse should fall like an aged tree, yet the "root" would sprout up and live. The word 'branch' occurs several times in the Old Testament, and in most, if not all, with express reference to the Messiah; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a> : 'Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a king shall reign;' <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15</a> : 'In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David;' <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a>. In all these places, there can be no doubt that there is reference to him who was "to spring up" from David, as a sprout does from a decayed and fallen tree, and who is, therefore, called a "root," a "branch" of the royal stock. There is, besides, a special beauty in the figure.<p>The family of David, when the Messiah was to come, would be fallen into decay and almost extinct. Joseph, the husband of Mary, though of the royal family of David <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-4.htm">Luke 2:4</a>, was poor, and the family had lost all claims to the throne. In this state, as from the decayed root of a fallen tree, a "sprout" or "branch" was to come forth with more than the magnificence of David, and succeed him on the throne. The name 'branch,' therefore, came to be significant of the Messiah, and to be synonymous with 'the son of David.' It is so used, doubtless, in this place, as denoting that the coming of the Messiah would be a joy and honor in the days of calamity to the Jews. Interpreters have not been agreed, however, in the meaning of this passage. Grotius supposed that it referred to Ezra or Nehemiah, but 'mystically to Christ and Christians.' Vogellius understood it of the "remnant" that should return from the Babylonian captivity. Michaelis supposed that it refers to the Jews, who should be a "reformed" people after their captivity, and who should spring up with a new spirit. Others have regarded it as a poetic description of the extraordinary fertility of the earth in future times. The reasons for referring it to the Messiah are plain:<p>(1) The word has this reference in other places, and the representation of the Messiah under the image of a branch or shoot, is, as we have seen, common in the Scriptures. Thus, also, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2</a>, he is called also &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;  shoresh, root, and &#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1511;  yo&#770;ne&#772;q, a tender plant, a sucker, sprout, shoot, as of a decayed tree; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-16.htm">Job 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-7.htm">Job 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-30.htm">Job 15:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-22.htm">Ezekiel 17:22</a>. And in reference to the same idea, perhaps, it is said, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>, that he was &#1504;&#1490;&#1494;&#1512;  n&#305;&#770;gezar, "cut off," as a branch, sucker, or shoot is cut off by the vine-dresser or farmer from the root of a decayed tree. And thus, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>, he is called &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b1; &#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3b4;  riza Dabid - the root of David.<p>(2) This interpretation accords best with the "magnificence" of the description, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5-6</a>; and,<p>(3) It was so understood by the Chaldee interpreter, and, doubtless, by the ancient Jews.<p>Shall be beautiful and glorious - Hebrew, 'Shall be beauty and glory;' that is, shall be the chief ornament or honor of the land; shall be that which gives to the nation its chief distinction and glory. In such times of calamity, his coming shal be an object of desire, and his approach shall shed a rich splendor on that period of the world.<p>And the fruit of the earth - &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1508;&#1512;&#1497;  per&#305;&#770;y ha&#770;'a&#770;rets correctly rendered "fruit of the earth, or of the land." The word 'earth' is often in the Scriptures used to denote the land of Judea, and perhaps the article here is intended to denote that that land is particularly intended. This is the parallel expression to the former part of the verse, in accordance with the laws of Hebrew poetry, by which one member of a sentence expresses substantially the same meaning as the former; see the Introduction, Section 8. If the former expression referred to the "Messiah," this does also. The 'fruit of the earth' is that which the earth produces, and is here not different in signification from the "branch" which springs out of the ground. Vitringa supposes that by this phrase the Messiah, according to his human nature, is meant. So Hengstenberg ("Christology, in loc.") understands it; and supposes that as the phrase "branch of Yahweh" refers to his divine origin, as proceeding from Yahweh; so this refers to his human origin, as proceeding from the earth. But the objections to this are obvious:<p>(1) The second phrase, according to the laws of Hebrew parallelism, is most naturally an echo or repetition of the sentiment in the first member, and means substantially the same thing.<p>(2) The phrase 'branch of Yahweh' does not refer of necessity to his divine nature. The idea is that of a decayed tree that has fallen down, and has left a living root which sends up a shoot, or sucker; and can be applied with great elegance to the decayed family of David. But how, or in what sense, can this be applied to Yahweh? Is Yahweh thus fallen and decayed? The idea properly is, that this shoot of a decayed family should be nurtured up by Yahweh; should be appointed by him, and should thus be "his" branch. The parallel member denotes substantially the same thing; 'the fruit of the earth' - the shoot which the earth produces - or which springs up from a decayed family, as the sprout does from a fallen tree.<p>(3) It is as true that his human nature proceeded from God as his divine. It was produced by the Holy Spirit, and can no more be regarded as 'the fruit of the earth' than his divine nature; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5</a>.<p>(4) This mode of interpretation is suited to bring the whole subject into contempt. There are plain and positive passages enough to prove that the Messiah had a divine nature, and there are enough also to prove that he was a man; but nothing is more adapted to produce disgust in relation to the whole subject, in the minds of skeptical or of thinking men, than a resort to arguments such as this in defense of a great and glorious doctrine of revelation.<p>Shall be excellent - Shall be "for exaltation," or "honor."<p>Comely - Hebrew, 'For an ornament;' meaning that "he" would be an honor to those times.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. In contrast to those on whom vengeance falls, there is a manifestation of Jesus Christ to the "escaped of Israel" in His characteristic attributes, beauty and glory, typified in Aaron's garments (Ex 28:2). Their sanctification is promised as the fruit of their being "written" in the book of life by sovereign love (Isa 4:3); the means of it are the "spirit of judgment" and that of "burning" (Isa 4:4). Their "defense" by the special presence of Jesus Christ is promised (Isa 4:5, 6).<p>branch&#8212;the sprout of Jehovah. Messiah (Jer 23:5; 33:15; Zec 3:8; 6:12; Lu 1:78, Margin). The parallel clause does not, as Maurer objects, oppose this; for "fruit of the earth" answers to "branch"; He shall not be a dry, but a fruit-bearing branch (Isa 27:6; Eze 34:23-27). He is "of the earth" in His birth and death, while He is also "of the Lord" (Jehovah) (Joh 12:24). His name, "the Branch," chiefly regards His descent from David, when the family was low and reduced (Lu 2:4, 7, 24); a sprout with more than David's glory, springing as from a decayed tree (Isa 11:1; 53:2; Re 22:16).<p>excellent&#8212;(Heb 1:4; 8:6).<p>comely&#8212;(So 5:15, 16; Eze 16:14).<p>escaped of Israel&#8212;the elect remnant (Ro 11:5); (1) in the return from Babylon; (2) in the escape from Jerusalem's destruction under Titus; (3) in the still future assault on Jerusalem, and deliverance of "the third part"; events mutually analogous, like concentric circles (Zec 12:2-10; 13:8, 9, &c.; 14:2; Eze 39:23-29; Joe 3:1-21).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In that day; </span> about and after that time; when the Lord shall have washed away (as this time is particularly expressed, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-4.htm" title="When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the middle thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.">Isaiah 4:4</a></span>) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the filth of Zion</span> by those dreadful judgments now described.

For after the foregoing miseries were brought upon the Jews, by the remainders of the Grecian empire, of which Daniel prophesies of exactly and particularly, and afterwards by the Roman empire, the Messiah was born; and after that utter destruction brought upon the Jewish city, and temple, and nation by Titus, the kingdom of the Messiah became <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">beautiful and glorious, </span> as it here follows. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The fruit of the earth shall be excellent; </span> the land which for the sins of the people was made barren, upon their repentance and return to Christ, shall recover its former fertility.

When the beauty of the Jewish women shall be taken away, and their men shall he slain; by whom is meant, not the righteous and wise men left among the Jews, as Jarchi and Aben Ezra; nor Hezekiah; which is the sense of some, as the latter observes: but the Messiah, as Kimchi, and so the Targum, which paraphrases the words thus, <p>"at that time shall the Messiah of the Lord be for joy and glory;'' <p>and the Septuagint understand it of a divine Person appearing on earth, rendering the words, "for in that day God shall shine in counsel with glory upon the earth"; and so the Arabic version. Christ is called "the branch", not as God, but as man, not as a son, but as a servant, as Mediator; and it chiefly regards his descent from David, and when his family was very mean and low; and a branch being but a tender thing, it denotes Christ's state of humiliation on earth, when he grew up as a tender plant before the Lord, and was contemptible in the eyes of men: and he is called the branch "of the Lord", because of his raising up, and bringing forth; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a> and yet this branch became "beautiful", being laden with the fruits of divine grace, such as righteousness, reconciliation, peace, pardon, adoption, sanctification, and eternal life; as well as having all his people as branches growing on him, and receiving their life and fruitfulness from him: and "glorious", being the branch made strong to do the work of the Lord, by his obedience and death; and especially he became glorious when raised from the dead, when he ascended up to heaven, and was exalted there at the right hand of God; and when his Gospel was spread and his kingdom increased in the Gentile world, as it did, both before and after the destruction of Jerusalem, the time here referred to; and which will he in a more glorious condition in the last days; and now he is glorious in the eyes of all that believe in him, and is glorified by them; and when he comes a second time, he will appear in his own and his father's glory, and in the glory of the holy angels. <p>And the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely; not the children of the righteous, as Jarchi; nor , "the doers of the law", as the Targum; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-13.htm">Romans 2:13</a> but the Messiah, as before, as Kimchi well observes; called "the fruit of the earth", to show that he is not a dry and withered, but a fruitful branch, and which should fill the earth with fruit; and because he sprung from the earth as man, and was the fruit of a woman, that was of the earth, earthly; and so this, as the former, denotes the meanness of Christ in human nature, while here on earth; and yet he became, as these words foretold be should, "excellent": he appeared to be excellent in his person as the Son of God, and to have a more excellent name and nature than the angels, and fairer than the sons of men; to be excellent as the cedars, and more excellent than the mountains of prey; to have obtained a more excellent ministry than Aaron and his sons; to be excellent in all his offices of Prophet, Priest, and King; and particularly in the fruits and blessings of grace, which grew upon him, and came from him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13</a> "and comely", in his person, as God and man, in the perfections of his divine nature, and in the fulness of his grace; and so are his people, as considered in him, who are made perfectly comely, through the comeliness he puts upon them: and so he is <p>for them that are escaped of Israel; not beautiful and glorious; excellent and comely, in the view of all men, only them that believe, who have seen his glory, and have tasted that he is gracious; these are the remnant according to the election of grace, the preserved of Israel, the chosen of God, and precious, who were saved from that untoward generation, the Jews, and escaped the destruction of Jerusalem, and were saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In that day shall the <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth <i>shall be</i> the pride and glory of them that have escaped of Israel.</span><p>(d) He comforts the Church in this desolation which will spring up like a bud signifying that God's graces should be as plentiful toward the faithful as though they sprang out of the earth, as in Isa 45:8.

The word occurs in the same sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-15.htm" title="And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take your wife, and your two daughters, which are here; lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.">Genesis 19:15</a> (A.V. “that which grew”) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-11.htm" title="For as the earth brings forth her bud, and as the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.">Isaiah 61:11</a> (“bud”). It stands in parallelism with the fruit of the land (not <span class="ital">earth</span>) in the next clause, and both expressions are to be understood quite literally. The reference to a personal Messiah is thus excluded by the context; for few will be prepared to apply <span class="ital">both</span> expressions to Christ, the former to His divine sonship and the latter to His human birth (although this view is defended by Delitzsch on the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-5.htm" title="He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a willow tree.">Ezekiel 17:5</a>). It is true that <span class="ital">afterwards</span> the Heb. word for “growth” (<span class="ital">çemaḥ</span>) came to be used as a, title of the Messiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-8.htm" title="Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you, and your fellows that sit before you: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.">Zechariah 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm" title="And speak to him, saying, Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:">Zechariah 6:12</a>), but this usage rests on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-15.htm" title="In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up to David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.">Jeremiah 33:15</a>, where the Messiah is described as a scion (<span class="ital">çemaḥ</span>) of the Davidic house.

The Final State of Zion and the Redeemed Israel<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Beyond the great judgment there is revealed to the prophet a vision of the ideal religious community, blessed with an exuberant supernatural fertility imparted to the soil (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm" title="In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.">Isaiah 4:2</a></span>), purified from sin (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/4-3.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem:...">Isaiah 4:3-4</a></span>), and overshadowed by the protecting presence of Jehovah (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/4-5.htm" title="And the LORD will create on every dwelling place of mount Zion, and on her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for on all the glory shall be a defense....">Isaiah 4:5-6</a></span>). It is a picture of the glorious Messianic age which immediately follows the day of the Lord. Those who inherit its glories are the survivors of the catastrophe (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/4-2.htm" title="In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel....">Isaiah 4:2-3</a></span>). Although the section has no definite historical background, it is obviously written as the sequel to ch. 2. 3; the allusion to the “daughters of Zion” (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-4.htm" title="When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the middle thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.">Isaiah 4:4</a></span>) would scarcely be intelligible apart from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-16.htm" title="Moreover the LORD said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:">Isaiah 3:16</a> ff., and possibly the glory of nature mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm" title="In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.">Isaiah 4:2</a> may form an antithesis to the artificial glories of civilisation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-7.htm" title="Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots:">Isaiah 2:7</a> ff. At the same time it is reasonable to suppose that the verses have only a literary connexion with the preceding oracles, and formed no part of Isaiah’s spoken message in the time of Ahaz.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By some recent critics (Duhm, Hackmann, Cheyne) the passage is assigned to a later editor of Isaiah’s prophecies, and even so cautious a scholar as Dillmann hesitates with regard to the last two verses.” The objections are based chiefly on considerations of style, and on the alleged post-Exilic character of the ideas and the symbolism. It is true that some leading words (such as those rendered “branch,” “create,” “defence,” “covert”) do not occur elsewhere in genuine writings of Isaiah. The imagery also is of a more pronounced apocalyptic cast than we might expect from Isaiah, and the style seems somewhat laboured and cumbrous. But on the other hand the main ideas—the salvation of a remnant, purification through judgment, the regeneration of nature—can all be paralleled from Isaiah, and this fact must be allowed some weight in favour of his authorship.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-6.</span> - As the present prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2.htm">Isaiah 2-4</a>.), though in the main one of threatening and denunciation, opened with a picture that was encouraging and comforting (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>), so new it terminates with a similar picture. The evangelical prophet, like the great apostle of the Gentiles, is unwilling that any one should be "swallowed up with overmuch sorrow." He will not separate the mercies of God from his judgments. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that day shall the branch of the Lord</span>, etc. Some see in this passage merely a promise that in the Messianic times the produce of the soil would become more abundant than ever before, its harvests richer, and its fruitage more luxuriant. But in the light of later prophecy it is scarcely possible to shut up the meaning within such narrow limits. The "Branch" of Isaiah can hardly be isolated altogether in a sound exegesis from the "Branch" of Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15</a>) and of Zechariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a>). Now, the "Branch" of Zechariah is stated to be "a man" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a>: note that the word used for "Branch" is the same as Isaiah's, viz. <span class="accented">tsemakh</span>), and the "Branch "of Jeremiah is a King (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15</a>). Moreover, Isaiah uses a nearly equivalent term (<span class="accented">netser</span>) in an admittedly Messianic sense. Although, therefore, there is some obscurity in the phrase, "<span class="accented">Branch</span> <span class="accented">of Jehovah</span>," it would seem to be best to understand Isaiah as here intimating, what he elsewhere openly declares (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1-5</a>) - viz. the coming of the Messiah in the latter days as the ornament and glory of his people. <span class="cmt_word">Be beautiful and glorious</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for beauty and glory</span>; or, <span class="accented">for ornament and glory</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the ornament and glorification of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">And the fruit of the earth</span>. It is argued with reason that the two clauses of this verse are parallel, not antithetical, and that as we understand the one, so must we understand the other. If, then, the "<span class="accented">Branch"</span> is the Messiah, so is "the fruit of the earth"-which may well be, since he was "the grain of wheat" which "fell into the ground and, lied, and so brought forth much fruit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-24.htm">John 12:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Excellent and comely</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for majesty and beauty</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-2.htm">Exodus 28:2, 40</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unto the escaped of Israel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "to those who shall have our-rived the great calamity, and become citizens of the restored Jerusalem." Dr. Kay well remarks that "the prophecy was adequately fulfilled only in those who 'saved themselves' from the generation which rejected Christ. That remnant was the germ of the Catholic Church, made such by being incorporated into the true Vine" ('Speaker's Commentary,' note <span class="accented">at loc</span>.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet then proceeds to describe still further how the Lord would take away the whole of their toilet as plunder. "On that day the Lord will put away the show of the ankle-clasps, and of the head-bands, and of the crescents; the ear-rings, and the arm-chains, and the light veils; the diadems, and the stepping-chains, and the girdles, and the smelling-bottles, and the amulets; the finger-rings, and the nose-rings; the gala-dresses, and the sleeve-frocks, and the wrappers, and the pockets; the hand-mirrors, and the Sindu-cloths, and the turbans, and the gauze mantles." The fullest explanation of all these articles of female attire is to be found in N. W. Schrder's work, entitled Commentarius de vestitu mulierum Hebraearum ad Jes. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16-24</a>, Ludg. Batav 1745 (a quarto volume), and in that of Ant. Theod. Hartmann, consisting of three octavo volumes, and entitled Die Hebrerin am Putztische und als Braut (The Jewess at the Toilet-table, and as Bride, 1809-10); to which we may also add, Saalschtz, Archaeologie, chapter iii., where he treats of the dresses of men and women. It was not usually Isaiah's custom to enter into such minute particulars. Of all the prophets, Ezekiel was the one most addicted to this, as we may see, for example, from <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>. And even in other prophecies against the women we find nothing of the kind again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-9.htm">Isaiah 32:9</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-1.htm">Amos 4:1</a>.). But in this instance, the enumeration of the female ornaments is connected with that of the state props in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1-3</a>, and that of the lofty and exalted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-13.htm">Isaiah 2:13-16</a>, so as to form a trilogy, and has its own special explanation in that boundless love of ornament which had become prevalent in the time of Uzziah-Jotham. It was the prophet's intention to produce a ludicrous, but yet serious impression, as to the immeasurable luxury which really existed; and in the prophetic address, his design throughout is to bring out the glaring contrast between the titanic, massive, worldly glory, in all its varied forms, and that true, spiritual, and majestically simple glory, whose reality is manifested from within outwards. In fact, the theme of the whole address is the way of universal judgment leading on from the false glory to the true. The general idea of tiphereth (show: rendered "bravery" in Eng. ver.) which stands at the head and includes the whole, points to the contrast presented by a totally different tiphereth which follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a>. In explaining each particular word, we must be content with what is most necessary, and comparatively the most certain. "Ankle-clasps" (aca&#770;sim): these were rings of gold, silver, or ivory, worn round the ankles; hence the denom. verb (icces) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16</a>, to make a tinkling sound with these rings. "Head-bands," or "frontlets" (shebisim, from sha&#770;bas  equals  sha&#770;batz: plectere), were plaited bands of gold or silver thread worn below the hair-net, and reaching from one ear to the other. There is some force, however, in the explanation which has been very commonly adopted since the time of Schrder, namely, that they were sun-like balls ( equals  shemisim), which were worn as ornaments round the neck, from the Arabic &#8219;sumeisa (&#8219;subeisa), a little sun. The "crescents" (saharonim) were little pendants of this kind, fastened round the neck and hanging down upon the breast (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-21.htm">Judges 8:21</a> we meet with them as ornaments hung round the camels' necks). Such ornaments are still worn by Arabian girls, who generally have several different kinds of them; the hila&#770;l, or new moon, being a symbol of increasing good fortune, and as such the most approved charm against the evil eye. "Ear-rings" (netiphoth, ear-drops): we meet with these in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>, as an ornament worn by Midianitish kings. Hence the Arabic munattafe, a woman adorned with ear-rings. "Arm-chains:" sheroth, from sha&#770;ra, to twist. According to the Targum, these were chains worn upon the arm, or spangles upon the wrist, answering to the spangles upon the ankles. "Fluttering veils" (re'a&#770;loth, from ra&#770;'al, to hang loose): these were more expensive than the ordinary veils worn by girls, which were called tza'iph. <p>"Diadems" (pe'erim) are only mentioned in other parts of the Scriptures as being worn by men (e.g., by priests, bride-grooms, or persons of high rank). "Stepping-chains:" tze'a&#770;doth, from tze'a&#770;dah, a step; hence the chain worn to shorten and give elegance to the step. "Girdles:" kisshurim, from ka&#770;shar (Cingere), dress girdles, such as were worn by brides upon their wedding-day (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-32.htm">Jeremiah 2:32</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>); the word is erroneously rendered hair-pins (kalmasmezayyah) in the Targum. "Smelling-bottles:" botte hannephesh, holders of scent (nephesh, the breath of an aroma). "Amulets:" lechashim (from la&#770;chash, to work by incantations), gems or metal plates with an inscription upon them, which were worn as a protection as well as an ornament. "Finger-rings:" tabba&#770;'oth, from ta&#770;ba, to impress or seal, signet-rings worn upon the finger, corresponding to the Chotha&#770;m worn by men upon the breast suspended by a cord. "Nose-rings" (nizme&#770; ha&#770;aph) were fastened in the central division of the nose, and hung down over the mouth: they have been ornaments in common use in the East from the time of the patriarchs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22</a>) down to the present day. "Gala-dresses" (machala&#770;tsoth) are dresses not usually worn, but taken off when at home. "Sleeve-frocks" (ma'ata&#770;pha&#770;h): the second tunic, worn above the ordinary one, the Roman stola. "Wrappers" (mitpa&#770;choth, from ta&#770;phach, expandere), broad cloths wrapped round the body, such as Ruth wore when she crept in to Boaz in her best attire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-15.htm">Ruth 3:15</a>). "Pockets" (Charitim) were for holding money (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-23.htm">2 Kings 5:23</a>), which was generally carried by men in the girdle, or in a purse (Cis). "Hand-mirrors" (gilyonim): the Septuagint renders this &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#834; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#768;, sc. &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, Lacedaemonian gauze or transparent dresses, which showed the nakedness rather than concealed it (from ga&#770;la&#770;h, retegere); but the better rendering is mirrors with handles, polished metal plates (from ga&#770;la&#770;h, polire), as gilla&#770;yon is used elsewhere to signify a smooth table. "Sindu-cloths" (sedinim), veils or coverings of the finest linen, viz., of Sindu or Hindu cloth (&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;) - Sindu, the land of Indus, being the earlier name of India.<p>(Note: The Mishna (Kelim xxiv 13) mentions three different sedinin: night dresses, curtains, and embroidery. The sindon is frequently referred to as a covering wrapped round the person; and in b. Menachoth 41a, it is stated that the sindom is the summer dress, the sarbal (cloak) the winter dress, which may help to explain <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-51.htm">Mark 14:51-52</a>.)<p>"Turbans" (tseniphoth, from tsa&#770;naph, Convolvere), the head-dress composed of twisted cloths of different colours. "Gauze mantles" (redidim, from ra&#770;dad, extendere, tenuem facere), delicate veil-like mantles thrown over the rest of the clothes. Stockings and handkerchiefs are not mentioned: the former were first introduced into Hither Asia from Media long after Isaiah's time, and a Jerusalem lady no more thought of suing the latter than a Grecian or Roman lady did. Even the veil (burko) now commonly worn, which conceals the whole of the face with the exception of the eyes, did not form part of the attire of an Israelitish woman in the olden time.<p>(Note: Rashi, however, makes a different statement (Sabbath 65a), viz., that "Israelitish women in Arabia go out with veils which conceal the face, and those in Media with their mantles fastened about the mouth.")<p>The prophet enumerates twenty-one different ornaments: three sevens of a very bad kind, especially for the husbands of these state-dolls. There is no particular order observed in the enumeration, either from head to foot, or from the inner to the outer clothing; but they are arranged as much ad libitum as the dress itself. </body></html>
