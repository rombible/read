It is one of Isaiah’s favourite words. The word for “dwelling-place” is almost invariably used for the tabernacle or temple, and would seem to have that meaning here. This determines the character of the “assemblies.” They are not the meetings of the people for counsel or debate, as in a Greek <span class= "ital">ecclesia, </span>but their “gatherings,” their “solemn assemblies,” in the courts of the temple. The thoughts of the prophet travel back to the history of the Exodus, when the presence of Jehovah was manifested as a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm" title="And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:">Exodus 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/9-15.htm" title="And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was on the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.">Numbers 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-34.htm" title="And the cloud of the LORD was on them by day, when they went out of the camp.">Numbers 10:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-14.htm" title="And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that you LORD are among this people, that you LORD are seen face to face, and that your cloud stands over them, and that you go before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.">Numbers 14:14</a>). In that Presence there would be safety and peace. The image is a favourite one with Isaiah, possibly as connected with the vision of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-4.htm" title="And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.">Isaiah 6:4</a>, for God’s protection of His people.<p><span class= "bld">Upon all the glory shall be a defence.</span>—The phrase is almost startlingly abrupt. The thought seems to be that over the “glory” of the new Jerusalem, as just described, there shall be stretched the overarching <span class= "ital">canopy </span>of the Divine Love. The word for “defence” occurs in this sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-5.htm" title="Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoices as a strong man to run a race.">Psalm 19:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-16.htm" title="Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.">Joel 2:16</a>, and is still used by Jews of the “canopy” held over bride and bridegroom at a wedding. The “baldacchino” over the altar of an Italian church probably represents the image that was present to Isaiah’s mind.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/isaiah/4.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Isaiah<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE PERPETUAL PILLAR OF CLOUD AND FIRE<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-5.htm" title="And the LORD will create on every dwelling place of mount Zion, and on her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for on all the glory shall be a defense.">Isaiah 4:5</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The pillar of cloud and fire in the Exodus was one: there are to be as many pillars as there are ‘assemblies’ in the new era. Is it straining the language too much to find significance in that difference? Instead of the formal unity of the Old Covenant, there is a variety which yet is a more vital unity. Is there not a hint here of the same lesson that is taught by the change of the one golden lamp-stand into the seven, which are a better unity because Jesus Christ walks among them?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The heart of this promise, thus cast into the form of ancient experiences, but with significant variations, is that of true communion with God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> That communion makes those who have it glorious.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> That communion supplies unfailing guidance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> A man in close fellowship with God will have wonderful flashes of sagacity, even about small practical matters. The gleam of the pillar will illumine conscience, and shine on many difficult, dark places. The ‘simplicity’ of a saintly soul will often see deeper into puzzling contingencies than the vulpine craftiness of the ‘prudent.’ The darker the night, the brighter the guidance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> That communion gives a defence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The pillar came between Egypt and Israel, and kept the foe off the timid crowd of slaves. Whatever forms our enemies take, fellowship with God will invest us with a defence as protean as our perils. The same cloud is represented in the context as being ‘a pavilion for a shadow in the heat, and for a refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-5.htm" title="And the LORD will create on every dwelling place of mount Zion, and on her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for on all the glory shall be a defense.">Isaiah 4:5</a>. </span><span class="ital">And the Lord will create </span>— Will, in a marvellous manner, produce, as it were, by a new work of creation; <span class="ital">upon every dwelling-place of mount Zion </span>— Upon all the private habitations of his people; <span class="ital">and upon her assemblies </span>— Upon the places of their public worship, and the persons assembled therein; <span class="ital">a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining, </span>&c. — He alludes to the pillar of a cloud and fire, which conducted and protected the Israelites in the wilderness, and afterward rested upon the tabernacle; and his words imply, that God would be the protector and glory of Zion. Such he was to Jerusalem after the return from Babylon; directing the Jews in their various difficulties, and defending them in their weak state against all the contrivances and attempts of their enemies, as we learn from the book of Nehemiah: and thus especially he was present with, and guided, protected, and preserved the first Christian Church, when he destroyed their unbelieving and disobedient countrymen. <span class="ital">Upon all the glory shall be a defence </span>— Upon all that church and people, which God will make glorious: upon the literal, but especially upon the mystical Jerusalem, upon all holy societies, or assemblies of sincere Christians. A learned commentator, who says the <span class="ital">dwelling-places </span>and <span class="ital">assemblies </span>of Sion “refer to the meetings of the apostles and other Christians at Jerusalem;” and that the next clause, <span class="ital">upon all the glory, </span>&c., means that the divine protection shall be afforded wherever God manifests himself by the extraordinary signs of his gracious presence, adds as follows: “Every symbol of the divine grace and glory, such as was the cloud, brings with it the protection and defence of that place or assembly, which is blessed with this prerogative. The event proves the truth of this interpretation. So long as God was in the temple, that place rejoiced in the benefit of the divine protection. When the voice was heard, ‘Let us depart hence,’ it was left to the desolation of its enemies.” Now the same, as he says, holds good in the Christian Church. While she cleaves to God, adheres to his truth, possesses his grace, obeys his laws, and worships him in the beauty of holiness, she has his presence with her, and is safe and happy. But, when the reverse of all this takes place, when his truth is disbelieved, his grace neglected, his laws broken, and his ordinances slighted, or attended in a mere formal way, his presence is withdrawn, and her glory and defence depart together.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:2-6 Not only the setting forth Christ's kingdom in the times of the apostles, but its enlargement by gathering the dispersed Jews into the church, is foretold. Christ is called the Branch of the Lord, being planted by his power, and flourishing to his praise. The gospel is the fruit of the Branch of the Lord; all the graces and comforts of the gospel spring from Christ. It is called the fruit of the earth, because it sprang up in this world, and was suited for the present state. It will be good evidence that we are distinguished from those merely called Israel, if we are brought to see all beauty in Christ, and holiness. As a type of this blessed day, Jerusalem should again flourish as a branch, and be blessed with the fruits of the earth. God will keep for himself a holy seed. When most of those that have a place and a name in Zion, and in Jerusalem, shall be cut off by their unbelief, some shall be left. Those only that are holy shall be left, when the Son of man shall gather out of his kingdom every thing which offends. By the judgment of God's providence, sinners were destroyed and consumed; but by the Spirit of grace they are reformed and converted. The Spirit herein acts as a Spirit of judgment, enlightening the mind, convincing the conscience; also as a Spirit of burning, quickening and strengthening the affections, and making men zealously affected in a good work. An ardent love to Christ and souls, and zeal against sin, will carry men on with resolution in endeavours to turn away ungodliness from Jacob. Every affliction serves believers as a furnace, to purify them from dross; and the convincing, enlightening, and powerful influences of the Holy Spirit, gradually root out their lusts, and render them holy as He is holy. God will protect his church, and all that belong to it. Gospel truths and ordinances are the glory of the church. Grace in the soul is the glory of it; and those that have it are kept by the power of God. But only those who are weary will seek rest; only those who are convinced that a storm is approaching, will look for shelter. Affected with a deep sense of the Divine displeasure, to which we are exposed by sin, let us at once have recourse to Jesus Christ, and thankfully accept the refuge he affords.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the Lord will create - The meaning of this verse and the next is, that God would take his people into his holy care and protection. The idea is expressed by images drawn, in this verse, from the protection which he afforded to the Israelites in their journeying from Egypt. The word "create" means here, he will afford, or furnish, such a defense.<p>Upon every dwelling-place ... - Upon all the habitations of his people; that is, they shall be secure, and regarded as under his protection. The word "upon" refers to the fact that the pillar of cloud stood "over" the tabernacle in the wilderness, as a symbol of the divine favor and presence. So his protection should be "on" or "over" the houses of all his people; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/92-4.htm">Psalm 92:4-6</a>.<p>Of mount Zion - compare the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>.<p>And upon her assemblies - Their convocations; their sacred assemblies, such as were called together on the Sabbath; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-2.htm">Leviticus 23:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-18.htm">Numbers 28:18</a>. It refers here to their "future" assemblies, and, therefore, includes the Christian church assembled to worship God.<p>A cloud and smoke by day - This refers to the pillar of cloud that went before the Israelites in their journey in the wilderness; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-20.htm">Exodus 14:20</a>.<p>By day - By day, this appeared to them as a cloud; by night, as a pillar of fire; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>. That is, it was always conspicuous, and could be seen by all the people. A pillar of cloud could not have been seen by night; and God changes the symbols of his presence and protection, so that at all times his people may see them. The meaning here is, that as God gave to the Israelites a symbol of his presence and protection, so he would be the protecter and defender of his people hereafter.<p>For upon all the glory - Above all the "glorious object;" that is, his church, his people. It is here called 'the glory,' as being a glorious, or an honorable object.<p>A defense - This word properly means "a covering, a protection," from the verb "to cover," and means that God will protect, or defend his people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. create&#8212;The "new creation" needs as much God's creative omnipotence, as the material creation (2Co 4:6; Eph 2:10). So it shall be in the case of the Holy Jerusalem to come (Isa 65:17, 18).<p>upon&#8212;The pillar of cloud stood over the tabernacle, as symbol of God's favor and presence (Ex 13:21, 22; Ps 91:1). Both on individual families ("every dwelling") and on the general sacred "assemblies" (Le 23:2). The "cloud" became a "fire" by night in order to be seen by the Lord's people.<p>upon all the glory&#8212;"upon the glorious whole"; namely, the Lord's people and sanctuary [Maurer]. May it not mean, "Upon whatever the glory (the Shekinah spoken of in the previous clause) shall rest, there shall be a defense." The symbol of His presence shall ensure also safety. So it was to Israel against the Egyptians at the Red Sea (Ex 14:19, 20). So it shall be to literal Jerusalem hereafter (Zec 2:5). Also to the Church, the spiritual "Zion" (Isa 32:18; 33:15-17; Heb 12:22).<p>tabernacle&#8212;Christ's body (Joh 1:14). "The word 'tabernacled' (Greek for 'dwelt') among us" (Joh 2:21; Heb 8:2). It is a "shadow from the heat" and "refuge from the storm" of divine wrath against man's sins (Isa 25:4). Heat and storms are violent in the East; so that a portable tent is a needful part of a traveller's outfit. Such shall be God's wrath hereafter, from which the "escaped of Israel" shall be sheltered by Jesus Christ (Isa 26:20, 21; 32:2).<p>covert&#8212;answering to "defense" (Isa 4:5). The Hebrew for defense in Isa 4:5, is "covering"; the lid of the ark or mercy seat was named from the same Hebrew word, caphar; the propitiatory; for it, being sprinkled with blood by the high priest once a year, on the day of atonement, covered the people typically from wrath. Jesus Christ is the true Mercy Seat, on whom the Shekinah rested, the propitiatory, or atonement, beneath whom the law is kept, as it was literally within the ark, and man is covered from the storm. The redeemed Israel shall also be, by union with Him, a tabernacle for God's glory, which, unlike that in the wilderness, shall not be taken down (Isa 38:20).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Will create; </span> will in a marvellous manner produce, as it were by a new work of creation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flashing fire by night; </span> a pillar of cloud and fire, like that wherewith the Lord directed, and protected, and honoured the israelites, when they came out of Egypt; whereby he implies that God would be their protector and their glory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Upon all the glory; </span> upon all that church and people, which God will make so glorious, not only in his own eyes, but even in the eyes of the world; upon all holy assemblies of sincere Christians. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord will create on every dwelling place of Mount Zion,....

"Thy might" is used interchangeably with "thy men," the possessors of the might being really intended, like robur and robora in Latin (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-35.htm">Jeremiah 49:35</a>). </body></html>
