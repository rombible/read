How does the profuseness of idolaters shame the niggardliness of many who call themselves God's servants, but are for a religion which costs them nothing! The service of sin always costs a great deal. God puts it to them what senseless, helpless things idols are. Let, then, the Jews show themselves men, avoiding such abominations. Many Scripture prophecies, delivered long ago, are not yet fulfilled; but the fulfilling of some is an earnest that the rest will come to pass. Nothing can help more to make us easy, than to be assured that God will do all his pleasure. Even those who know not and mind not God's revealed will, are called and used to fulfil the counsels of his secret will. Heaven and earth shall pass away, sooner than one tittle of the word of God. Obstinate sinners are addressed. Such were far from acceptance, but they were summoned to hearken to the word of the Lord. The salvation of a sinner begins with a humble and contrite heart, that trembles at God's word, with godly sorrow working true repentance, and faith in his mercy, through the obedience unto death of our Divine Surety. Christ, as the Divine righteousness and salvation to his people, would come in the appointed time. His salvation abides in his church for all believers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/46.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Remember this - Bear in mind what is now said of the manner in which idols are made. This is addressed, doubtless, to the Jews, and is designed to keep them from idolatry.<p>And show yourselves men - Act as men; throw away the childish trifles of idolaters. The word used here (&#1492;&#1514;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;  hithe'osha&#770;shu&#770;' occurs nowhere else in the Bible. It is according to Gesenius, derived from &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;  '&#305;&#770;ysh, "a man," and means to act "as a man." A similar word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-13.htm">1 Corinthians 16:13</a> (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;  andrizesthe, from &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;  ane&#772;r, a man), and is correctly rendered there, 'quit you like men.'

So Kimchi renders it: 'Be men, and not brutes, which neither consider nor understand.'<p>O ye transgressors - Ye who have violated the laws of God by the worship of idols. In the time of Manasseh, the Israelites were much addicted to idolatry, and probably this is to be regarded as addressed to them, and as designed to recall them from it to the worship of the true God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/46.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. show yourselves men&#8212;Renounce the childishness of idolatry as shown in what precedes (1Co 14:20; 16:13; Eph 4:14).

Hitherto they have not fallen away, but they are in danger of so doing. Remember, he says to them, or "bear in mind constantly the impotence of the idols, and the power of Jehovah, and then stand firm - remain in your old faith - do not be drawn over to so foolish a thing as idolatry." O ye transgressors. It is to be a "transgressor" even to contemplate the turning from Jehovah to idolatry. Israel has been already "called a transgressor from the beginning" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-8.htm">Isaiah 48:8</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/46.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There follows now a trilogy of prophecies referring to Babylon. After the prophet has shown what Israel has to expect of Cyrus, he turns to what awaits Babylon at the hands of Cyrus. "Bel sinketh down, Nebo stoopeth; its images come to the beast of burden and draught cattle: your litters are laden, a burden for the panting. They stopped, sank down all at once, and could not get rid of the burden; and their own self went into captivity." The reference to Babylon comes out at once in the names of the gods. Be&#772;l was the Jupiter of the Babylonians and, as Bel-Merodach, the tutelar deity of Babylon; Nebo was Mercury, the tutelar deity of the later Chaldean royal family, as the many kings' names in which it appears clearly show (e.g., Mabonassar, Nabo-polassar, etc.). The pryamidal heap of ruins on the right bank of the Euphrates, which is now called Birs Nimrud, is the ruin of the temple of Bel, of which Herodotus gives a description in i.-181-183, and probably also of the tower mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11</a>, which was dedicated to Bel, if not to El  equals  Saturn. Herodotus describes two golden statues of Bel which were found there (cf., Diodorus, ii. 9, 5), but the way in which Nebo was represented is still unknown. The judgment of Jehovah falls upon these gods through Cyrus. Bel suddenly falls headlong, and Nebo stoops till he also falls. Their images come to (fall to the lot of) the chayya&#770;h, i.e., the camels, dromedaries, and elephants; and behe&#772;ma&#770;h, i.e., horses, oxen, and asses. Your &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;, gestamina, the prophet exclaims to the Babylonians, i.e., the images hitherto carried by you in solemn procession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-20.htm">Isaiah 45:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-26.htm">Amos 5:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-5.htm">Jeremiah 10:5</a>), are now packed up, a burden for that which is wearied out, i.e., for cattle that has become weary with carrying them. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1</a>, as the two participial clauses show, the prophet still takes his stand in the midst of the catastrophe; but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-2.htm">Isaiah 46:2</a> it undoubtedly lies behind him as a completed act. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-2.htm">Isaiah 46:2</a> he continues, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1</a>, to enter into the delusion of the heathen, and distinguish between the numina and simulacra. The gods of Babylon have all stooped at once, have sunken down, and have been unable to save their images which were packed upon the cattle, out of the hands of the conquerors. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-2.htm">Isaiah 46:2</a> he destroys this delusion: they are going into captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-5.htm">Hosea 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a>), even "their ownself" (naphsha&#770;m), since the self or personality of the beingless beings consists of nothing more than the wood and metal of which their images are composed. </body></html>
