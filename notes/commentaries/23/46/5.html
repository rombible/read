The fate of Bel and Nebo is urged against those who thought that they might worship Jehovah as those deities had been worshipped. Such had been the sin of the calves at Bethel and at Dan. Like it had been the act of Israel when it had carried the ark into battle against the Philistines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-5.htm" title="And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.">1Samuel 4:5</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/46.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/46-5.htm" title="To whom will you liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like?...">Isaiah 46:5-8</a></span>. <span class="ital">To whom will you liken me, </span>&c. — If you be tempted at any time to exchange me for an idol, do me and yourselves the right seriously to consider, whether you can find another god, who will be more able and more ready to do you good than I have been. <span class="ital">They lavish gold &c., and he maketh it a god </span>— Let us suppose a god made with the greatest cost and art. <span class="ital">They bear him upon the shoulder </span>— From that place where he is made, unto that place where they intend to set him up. <span class="ital">From his place shall he not remove </span>— Or, rather, <span class="ital">he cannot remove. </span>He cannot stir, either hand or foot, to help his people. <span class="ital">Remember this </span>— Consider these things which I now speak, O ye Israelites; <span class="ital">and show yourselves men </span>— Act like reasonable creatures, and be not so brutish as to worship your own works: be so wise and courageous as to withstand all solicitations to idolatry. <span class="ital">Bring it again to mind, O ye transgressors </span>— Think of this again and again, O ye who have been guilty of this foolish sin, and who, therefore, are obliged to take the better heed, lest you should relapse into it again. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/46.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>46:5-13 Here the folly of those who made idols, and then prayed to them, is exposed. How does the profuseness of idolaters shame the niggardliness of many who call themselves God's servants, but are for a religion which costs them nothing! The service of sin always costs a great deal. God puts it to them what senseless, helpless things idols are. Let, then, the Jews show themselves men, avoiding such abominations. Many Scripture prophecies, delivered long ago, are not yet fulfilled; but the fulfilling of some is an earnest that the rest will come to pass. Nothing can help more to make us easy, than to be assured that God will do all his pleasure. Even those who know not and mind not God's revealed will, are called and used to fulfil the counsels of his secret will. Heaven and earth shall pass away, sooner than one tittle of the word of God. Obstinate sinners are addressed. Such were far from acceptance, but they were summoned to hearken to the word of the Lord. The salvation of a sinner begins with a humble and contrite heart, that trembles at God's word, with godly sorrow working true repentance, and faith in his mercy, through the obedience unto death of our Divine Surety. Christ, as the Divine righteousness and salvation to his people, would come in the appointed time. His salvation abides in his church for all believers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/46.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To whom will ye liken me - (see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-25.htm">Isaiah 40:25</a>). The design of this and the following verses is to show the folly of idolatry, and the vanity of trusting in idols. This is a subject that the prophet often dwells on. The argument here is derived from the fact that the idols of Babylon were unable to defend the city, and were themselves carried away in triumph <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1-2</a>. If so, how vain was it to rely on them! how foolish to suppose that the living and true God could resemble such weak and defenseless blocks! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/46.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

The parenthetical insertion of &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1500;&#1497; &#1500;, with reference to, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-7.htm">Isaiah 41:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>) is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-57.htm">Psalm 119:57</a>. &#1488;&#1498; has a restrictive sense here, which springs out of the affirmative (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-7.htm">Psalm 39:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-1.htm">Psalm 73:1</a>), just as, in the case of raq, the affirmative grows out of the primary restrictive sense. The "righteousness" is abounding (superabundant) righteousness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15</a>.). &#1506;&#1494; is the strength of sanctification, and of the conquest of the world. The subject to &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; (which is not to be changed, according to the Masora, into the more natural &#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, as it is by the lxx, Syr., and Vulg.) is, whoever has seen what man has in Jehovah, and made confession of this; such a man does not rest till he has altogether come over to Jehovah, whereas all His enemies are put to shame. They separate themselves irretrievably from the men who serve Him, the restoration of whom is His direct will, and the goal of the history of salvation. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-25.htm">Isaiah 45:25</a> "In Jehovah all the seed of Israel shall become righteous, and shall glory." Ruetschi has very properly observed on this verse, that the reference is to the Israel of God out of all the human race, i.e., the church of the believers in Israel expanded by the addition of the heathen; which church is now righteous, i.e., reconciled and renewed by Jehovah, and glories in Him, because by grace it is what it is. <p>This brings the sixth prophecy to a close. Its five strophes commence with "Thus saith the Lord;" at the same time, the fifth strophe has two "woes" (hoi) before this, as the ground upon which it rests. </body></html>
