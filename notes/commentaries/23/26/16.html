This seems to be spoken of the siege which the Jewish people endured, and of all their other labours and sufferings to prevent their coming under the Chaldean yoke. Thus the attempt of Zedekiah to withstand Nebuchadnezzar we find only brought greater evils upon the country, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-13.htm" title="And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning to the LORD God of Israel.">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>.

They had been slaves of sin and Satan; but by the Divine grace they were taught to look to be set free from all former masters. The cause opposed to God and his kingdom will sink at last. See our need of afflictions. Before, prayer came drop by drop; now they pour it out, it comes now like water from a fountain. Afflictions bring us to secret prayer. Consider Christ as the Speaker addressing his church. His resurrection from the dead was an earnest of all the deliverance foretold. The power of his grace, like the dew or rain, which causes the herbs that seem dead to revive, would raise his church from the lowest state. But we may refer to the resurrection of the dead, especially of those united to Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Poured out a prayer - Margin, 'Secret speech.'

This, and the two following verses <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-17.htm">Isaiah 26:17</a>, represent the troubles and disappointments of the church and people of God, before the destruction of antichrist; in which time of trouble they will visit the Lord, frequent the throne of grace, as saints in afflictions are wont to do; and sometimes this is the end to be answered by afflictions, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/5-15.htm">Hosea 5:15</a>, <p>they poured out a prayer; or "muttering" (e); they will pray with a low voice, in an humble and submissive way, as persons in dejected circumstances; not a few words, but many, will they use; their petitions will be numerous; they will continue praying, and be constant at it, and out of the abundance of their hearts their mouth will speak; and they will pour out their souls and their complaints to the Lord, though privately, and with a low voice, and with groans unutterable: <p>when thy chastening was upon them; the afflicting hand of God, not as a punishment, but as a fatherly chastisement upon them; so all their persecutions from men are considered as permitted by the Lord for their instruction and correction; and these will not drive them from God, but bring them to him to seek him by prayer and supplication. <p>(e) "mussitationem", Montanus; "submissam orationem", Junius &amp; Tremellius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">LORD, in trouble have they <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> visited thee, they poured out a prayer <i>when</i> thy chastening <i>was</i> upon them.</span><p>(p) That is, the faithful by the rods were moved to pray to you for deliverance.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/26.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">in trouble</span> (“distress” or “straits,” as ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-4.htm" title="For you have been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.">Isaiah 25:4</a>) <span class="ital">have they visited thee</span>] i.e. sought after thee. The verb might also mean “missed thee”—felt their need of thee. This was no doubt a spiritual gain, but the author’s complaint is that so little outward benefit has accrued from the nation’s discipline of sorrow.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they poured out … upon them</span>] A difficult clause. The rendering of A.V. (and R.V.) is perhaps the best that can be made of the received text, but it can hardly be defended. The root-meaning of the word for “prayer” is “whisper,” but in usage it is confined to the sense of “enchantment.” It is questionable if it could mean “whispered prayer,” although the cognate verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-19.htm" title="But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said to his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.">2 Samuel 12:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-7.htm" title="All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.">Psalm 41:7</a> might be appealed to in support of this view. Moreover, the verbal form “they poured out” is anomalous, and the syntax of “when thy chastisement was upon them” is at least hard. The only alternative translation that requires notice is that of Koppe (adopted by several good commentators): “the binding of a spell was thy chastisement unto them,” i.e. it acted on them with the potency of a spell. The construction there is easy enough and the textual change is only in the vowel-points; but the noun “binding” (“pressure”) does not occur, and the simile is perhaps too bold.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">16–18</span>. The poet plunges abruptly into a train of reflection on the depressing side of the nation’s experience.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lord, in trouble have they visited thee</span>. Here, at any rate, the redeemed go back in thought to their time of trouble. They remember that what brought them back to God from that alienation which they have confessed (ver. 13) was the affliction which they so long endured. Their present bliss is the result of their former woe, and recalls the thought of it. <span class="cmt_word">They poured out</span> <span class="cmt_word">a prayer</span>; rather, as in the margin, <span class="accented">a secret speech</span>, or <span class="accented">a low whisper</span> (Kay); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-4.htm">Isaiah 29:4</a>. The word elsewhere means "the muttering of a <span class="accented">charm</span>," but must here signify the "<span class="accented">whispered</span> prayer" of one in deep humiliation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Here again the shiir has struck the note of a ma&#770;sha&#770;l. And proceeding in this tone, it pauses here once more to reflect as at the close of a strophe. "If favour is shown to the wicked man, he does not learn righteousness; in the most upright land he acts wickedly, and has no eye for the majesty of Jehovah." &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#1497;&#1495;&#1503; is a hypothetical clause, which is left to be indicated by the emphasis, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-8.htm">Nehemiah 1:8</a> (Ewald, 357, b): granting that favour (che&#772;n  equals  "goodness," <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>) is constantly shown to the wicked man. "The most upright land:" 'eretz necochoth is a land in which everything is right, and all goes honourably. A worthless man, supposing he were in such a land, would still act knavishly; and of the majesty of Jehovah, showing itself in passing punishments of sin, though still sparing him, he would have no perception whatever. The prophet utters this with a painful feeling of indignation; the word bal indicating denial with emotion. </body></html>
