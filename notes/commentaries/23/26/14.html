They had been slaves of sin and Satan; but by the Divine grace they were taught to look to be set free from all former masters. The cause opposed to God and his kingdom will sink at last. See our need of afflictions. Before, prayer came drop by drop; now they pour it out, it comes now like water from a fountain. Afflictions bring us to secret prayer. Consider Christ as the Speaker addressing his church. His resurrection from the dead was an earnest of all the deliverance foretold. The power of his grace, like the dew or rain, which causes the herbs that seem dead to revive, would raise his church from the lowest state. But we may refer to the resurrection of the dead, especially of those united to Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They are dead - That is, the kings and tyrants to whom reference is made in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-13.htm">Isaiah 26:13</a>.

The above tyrannical lords, the kings of the earth and their mighty men, associates of the Romish antichrist, who shall be gathered together, and slain at the battle at Armageddon; these shall not live again in this world, nor rise from their graves, and return to their former state, power, and authority; or tyrannise over, molest, disturb, oppress, and persecute the people of God any more; though they shall live again at the end of the thousand years, and shall awake to everlasting shame and contempt, and come forth to the resurrection of damnation. The Targum is, <p>"they worship the dead, who do not live; and their mighty men, who shall not rise;'' <p>and are opposed to the worshippers of the only Lord God: <p>therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish; or, "because thou hast visited", &amp;c. (d); for these words are a reason why they are irrecoverably lost, and shall not live in eternal life, or rise in the resurrection of the just; because God has visited them in wrath, destroyed them in and for their sins, with such an utter destruction, that they shall be remembered no more. This visitation will be at Armageddon, when the kings, and captains and great men will be slain; the beast and false prophet taken, and cast alive into the furnace of fire; and the rest will be killed by the sword, proceeding out of the mouth of Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-18.htm">Revelation 19:18</a>.

In the form of a general proposition the writer expresses Israel’s sense of security with regard to those “other lords” who have now vanished from the earth. The idea is probably suggested by ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-9.htm" title="Hell from beneath is moved for you to meet you at your coming: it stirs up the dead for you, even all the chief ones of the earth; it has raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.">Isaiah 14:9</a> ff.

How strange it seems that the "great gods" whom so many millions worshipped in former times - Bel, and Asshur, and Ammon, and Zeus, and Jupiter - should have passed so completely away as to be almost wholly forgotten! <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>It then commences again in a lyrical tone in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-8.htm">Isaiah 26:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-9.htm">Isaiah 26:9</a> : "We have also waited for Thee, that Thou shouldest come in the path of Thy judgments; the desire of the soul went after Thy name, and after Thy remembrance. With my soul I desired Thee in the night; yea, with my spirit deep within me, I longed to have Thee here: for when Thy judgments strike the earth, the inhabitants of the earth learn righteousness." In the opinion of Hitzig, Knobel, Drechsler, and others, the prophet here comes back from the ideal to the actual present. But this is not the case. The church of the last days, looking back to the past, declares with what longing it has waited for that manifestation of the righteousness of God which has now taken place. "The path of Thy judgments:" 'orach mishpa&#770;te&#772;ka&#770; belongs to the te; venientem (or venturum) being understood. The clause follows the poetical construction &#1488;&#1512;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;, after the analogy of &#1491;&#1512;&#1498; &#1492;&#1500;&#1498;. They longed for God to come as a Redeemer in the way of His judgments. The "name" and "remembrance" ad the nature of God, that has become nameable and memorable through self-assertion and self-manifestation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>). They desired that God should present Himself again to the consciousness and memory of man, by such an act as should break through His concealment and silence. The prophet says this more especially of himself; for he feels himself "in spirit" to be a member of the perfected church. "My soul" and "my spirit" are accusatives giving a more precise definition (Ewald, 281, c). "The night" is the night of affliction, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-11.htm">Isaiah 21:11</a>. In connection with this, the word shiche&#772;r (lit. to dig for a thing, to seek it eagerly) is employed here, with a play upon shachar. The dawning of the morning after a night of suffering was the object for which he longed, naphshi (my soul), i.e., with his entire personality (Pyschol. p. 202), and ruchi b'kirbi (my spirit within me), i.e., with the spirit of his mind, &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; (Psychol. p. 183). And why? Because, as often as God manifested Himself in judgment, this brought men to the knowledge, and possibly also to the recognition, of what was right (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-17.htm">Psalm 9:17</a>). "Will learn:" la&#770;mdu is a praet. gnomicum, giving the result of much practical experience. </body></html>
