The image is suggested by the situation of Samaria, high on a hill-side, crowning the valley, and by the rich vegetation and bright flowers which makes it even now one of the few lovely scenes in Palestine; and by the luxurious riot and sensual excess that were always characteristic of the northern kingdom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The destruction of Samaria and of the kingdom, then, is here prophesied-the garland will fade, the hail will batter all its drooping flowerets, and it shall be trodden under foot. Look at that withered wreath that gleamed yesterday on some fair head, to-day flung into the ashpit or kicked about the street. That is a modern rendering of the prophet’s imagery. But the reference goes further than merely to the city: the whole state of the nation is expressed by the symbol, as doomed to quick decay, fading in itself, and further smitten down by divine judgments.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There is a contrasted picture, that of ‘the residue of the people’ to whom there is an amaranthine crown, a festal diadem glorious and beautiful, which can never fade, even God Himself. To them who love Him He is an ornament, and His presence is the consecration of the true joyful feast. They who are crowned by Him are crowned, not for idle revelry, but for strenuous toil {‘sit in judgment’} and for brave purpose {‘turn the battle to the gate,’} and their coronation day is ever the day when earthly garlands are withered, whether it be the crises and convulsions of nations and institutions, or times of personal trial, or ‘in the hour of death or in the day of judgment.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Expanding then these thoughts, we have-<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. All godless joys are but fading chaplets.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Of course the first application of such words is to purely sensuous delights.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Men who seek to make life a mere revel and banquet.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Nothing is so short-lived as gratification of appetite. It is not merely that each act lasts but for a moment, but also that past gratifications leave no sort of solace to the appetite behind them; whereas past acquirements or deeds of goodness are a perpetual joy as well as the foundation of the present. There is something essentially isolated in each act of sensuous delight. No man can by so willing recall the taste of eaten food, nor slake his thirst by remembrance of former draughts, or cool himself by thinking of ‘frosty Caucasus.’ But each such gratification is done when it is done, and there is an end of its power to gratify.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Further, the power of enjoyment wanes, though the lust for it waxes. Hence each act has less and less power of satisfying.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> One sees <span class="ital">blase</span> young men of twenty-five. It was a man of under thirty-five who wrote, ‘Man delights not me, no, nor woman neither.’ It was a used-up <span class="ital">roue</span> that was represented as saying, ‘Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.’ It was of sensuous ‘pleasures’ that poor Burns wrote,-<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">‘Like the snowfall in the river,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A moment white,-then melts for ever.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>When a people is given over to such excess, late or soon the fate of Samaria comes upon them. Think of the French Revolution or of the fall of Rome, and learn that the prophet was announcing a law for all nations, in his fiery denunciation, and one which holds good to-day as ever.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But we may generalise more widely. Every godless life is essentially transitory; of course, all life is so in one view. But suppose two men, working side by side at the same occupation, passing through the same circumstances. So far as physical changes go, these men are the same. Both lose much. Both leave behind much. Both cease to be interested in much that was dear to them. Both die at last, and leave it all. Is there any difference? The transitoriness is the same, and the eternal consequences are eternal alike in both; and yet there is a very solemn sense in which the one man’s life has utterly perished, and the other’s abides. Suppose a man, educated to be a first-rate man of business, dies. Which of his trained faculties will he have scope for in that new order of things? Or a student, or a lawyer, or a statesman?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Oh, it is not our natural mortality that makes these thoughts so awful; but it is the thought that the man who is doing these things is immortal. The head which wears the fading wreath will live for ever. ‘What will ye do in the end?’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Godly life brings unfading joys.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Communion with God yields abiding joys. The law of change remains the same. The law of death remains the same. But the motives which direct and impel the godly man are beyond the reach of change.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The habits which he contracts are for heaven as well as for earth. The treasures which he amasses will always be his.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> His life in its essence and his work are one in all worlds. What a grand continuity, then, knits into one a godly life whether it is lived on earth or in heaven!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Communion with God gives beauty and ornament to the whole character. It brings the true refining and perfecting of the soul. No doubt many Christian men, as we see them, are but poor specimens of this effect of godliness; still, it is an effect produced in proportion to the depth and continuity of their communion. We might dwell on the effect on Will, Affections, Understanding, produced by dwelling in God. It is simple fact that the highest conceivable type of beauty is only reached through communion with God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Communion with God gives power as well as gladness. The life of abiding with God is also one of strenuous effort and real warfare. In the context it is promised that God will be for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The luxurious life of self-indulgence ends, as all selfish life must do, in the vanishing of delights. The life of joy in God issues, as all true joy does, in power for work and in power for conflict.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘God doth anoint thee with His odorous oil, to wrestle, not to reign.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. There will be a coronation day.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>‘In that day,’ the day when ‘the crown of pride shall be trodden under foot,’ the people of God are crowned with the diadem of beauty which is God Himself. That twofold work of that one day suggests-<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The double aspect of trials and sorrows.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The double aspect of death.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The double aspect of final Judgment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> To be crowned or discrowned ‘in that day’ is the alternative set before each of us. Which of the two do we choose?<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:1-4 What men are proud of, be it ever so mean, is to them as a crown; but pride is the forerunner of destruction. How foolishly drunkards act! Those who are overcome with wine are overcome by Satan; and there is not greater drudgery in the world than hard drinking. Their health is ruined; men are broken in their callings and estates, and their families are ruined by it. Their souls are in danger of being undone for ever, and all merely to gratify a base lust. In God's professing people, like Israel, it is worse than in any other. And he is just in taking away the plenty they thus abuse. The plenty they were proud of, is but a fading flower. Like the early fruit, which, as soon as discovered, is plucked and eaten.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one - The Hebrew of this passage is, 'Lo! there is to the Lord (&#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;  la'dona&#772;y) mighty and strong.' Lowth renders it,<p>'Behold the mighty one, the exceedingly strong one,'<p>And supposes that it means the Lord himself. It is evident, however, that something must be understood as being that which the Lord 'hath,' for the Hebrew properly implies that there is something strong and mighty which is under his control, and with which, as with a tempest, he will sweep away and destroy Ephraim. Jarchi supposes that &#1512;&#1493;&#1495;  ru&#770;ach ("wind") is understood; Kimchi thinks that the word is &#1497;&#1493;&#1501;  yo&#770;m ("day"); others believe that &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;  chayil ("an army") is understood. But I think the obvious interpretation is to refer it to the Assyrian king, as the agent by which Yahweh would destroy Samaria <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3-6</a>. This power was entirely under the direction of Yahweh, and would be employed by him in accomplishing his purpose on that guilty people (compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>).<p>As a tempest of hail - A storm of hail is a most striking representation of the desolation that is produced by the ravages of an invading army (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-21.htm">Job 27:21</a>; the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-30.htm">Isaiah 30:30</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-15.htm">Hosea 13:15</a>).<p>A flood of mighty waters - This is also a striking description of the devastating effects of an invading army (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-5.htm">Psalm 90:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-7.htm">Jeremiah 46:7-8</a>)<p>Shall cast down to the earth - To cast it to the earth means that it should be entirely humbled and destroyed (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-12.htm">Isaiah 25:12</a>).<p>With the hand - Septuagint: &#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837;  bia - 'Force,' 'violence.'

The verb <span class="ital">shall be trodden</span> is in the plural number. Apparently the prophet intended to include in its subject both the images of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-1.htm" title="Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine!">Isaiah 28:1</a></span>; but his thoughts were diverted by the other figure which is developed in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-4.htm" title="And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer; which when he that looks on it sees, while it is yet in his hand he eats it up.">Isaiah 28:4</a></span>. In the Hebr. the order is: <span class="bld">With the feet shall be trodden down the proud crown of the,</span> &c. (as <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-1.htm" title="Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine!">Isaiah 28:1</a></span>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The crown of pride, the drunkards</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of the drunkards</span> (comp. ver. 1). The "crown of pride" is scarcely "Samaria," as Delitzsch supposes, it is rather the self-complacent and boastful spirit of the Israelite people, which will be "trodden under foot" by the Assyrians. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet said this from out of the midst of the state of punishment, and was therefore able still further to confirm the fact, that the punishment would cease with the sin, by the punishment which followed the sin. "For the strong city is solitary, a dwelling given up and forsaken like the steppe: there calves feed, and there they lie down, and eat off its branches. When its branches become withered, they are broken: women come, make fires with them; for it is not a people of intelligence: therefore its Creator has no pity upon it, and its Former does not pardon it." The nation without any intelligence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>), of which Jehovah was the Creator and Former (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>), is Israel; and therefore the fortress that has been destroyed is the city of Jerusalem. The standpoint of the prophet must therefore be beyond the destruction of Jerusalem, and in the midst of the captivity. If this appears strange for Isaiah, nearly every separate word in these two vv. rises up as a witness that it is Isaiah, and no other, who is speaking here (compare, as more general proofs, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-13.htm">Isaiah 32:13-14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-17.htm">Isaiah 5:17</a>; and as more specific exemplifications, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-2.htm">Isaiah 16:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-7.htm">Isaiah 11:7</a>, etc.). The suffix in "her branches" refers to the city, whose ruins were overgrown with bushes. Synonymous with &#1505;&#1506;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, branches (always written with dagesh in distinction from &#1505;&#1506;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;, clefts, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-21.htm">Isaiah 2:21</a>), is ka&#770;tzir, cuttings, equivalent to shoots that can be easily cut off. It was a mistake on the part of the early translators to take ka&#770;tzir in the sense of "harvest" (Vulg., Symm., Saad., though not the lxx or Luther). As ka&#770;tzir is a collective term here, signifying the whole mass of branches, the predicate can be written in the plural, tissha&#770;barna&#770;h, which is not to be explained as a singular form, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-3.htm">Isaiah 28:3</a>. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468;, in the neuter sense, points back to this: women light it &#1492;&#1488;&#1497;&#1512;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-10.htm">Malachi 1:10</a>), i.e., make with it a lighting flame (&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;) and a warming fire (&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-16.htm">Isaiah 54:16</a>). So desolate does Jerusalem lie, that in the very spot which once swarmed with men a calf now quietly eats the green foliage of the bushes that grow between the ruins; and in the place whence hostile armies had formerly been compelled to withdraw without accomplishing their purpose, women now come and supply themselves with wood without the slightest opposition. </body></html>
