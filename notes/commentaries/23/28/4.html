Such a fig the passer-by seizes, and eagerly devours. So, the prophet says, with a Dante-like homeliness of comparison, should the Assyrian king treat Samaria.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:1-4 What men are proud of, be it ever so mean, is to them as a crown; but pride is the forerunner of destruction. How foolishly drunkards act! Those who are overcome with wine are overcome by Satan; and there is not greater drudgery in the world than hard drinking. Their health is ruined; men are broken in their callings and estates, and their families are ruined by it. Their souls are in danger of being undone for ever, and all merely to gratify a base lust. In God's professing people, like Israel, it is worse than in any other. And he is just in taking away the plenty they thus abuse. The plenty they were proud of, is but a fading flower. Like the early fruit, which, as soon as discovered, is plucked and eaten.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As the hasty fruit before the summer - The word rendered 'hasty fruit' (&#1489;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;  biku&#770;ra&#770;h); in Arabic, bokkore; in Spanish, albacore), denotes the "early fig." this ripens in June; the common fig does not ripen until August. Shaw, in his "Travels," p. 370, says: 'No sooner does the "boccore" (the early fig) draw near to perfection in the middle or latter end of June, than the "kermez" or summer fig begins to be formed, though it rarely ripens before August, about which time the same tree frequently throws out a third crop, or the winter fig, as we may call it. This is usually of a much longer shape and darker complexion than the kermez, hanging and ripening on the tree after the leaves are shed; and provided the winter be mild and temperate it is gathered as a delicious morsel in the spring.' Robinson (George), ("Travels in Palestine and Syria," vol. i. p. 354), says, 'The fig tree, which delights in a rocky and parched soil, and is therefore often found in barren spots where nothing else will grow, is very common in Palestine and the East. The fruit is of two kinds, the "boccore" and the "kermouse." The black and white boccore, or early fig, is produced in May; but the kermouse, or the fig properly so called, which is preserved and exported to Europe, is rarely ripe before September.' Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>. The phrase 'before the summer' means before the heat of the summer, when the common fig was usually ripe. The idea here is this, the early fig would be plucked and eaten with great greediness. So the city of Samaria would be seized upon and destroyed by its enemies.<p>Which when he that looketh upon it seeth ... - That is, as soon as he sees it he plucks it, and eats it at once. He does not lay it up for future use, but as soon as he has it in his hand he devours it. So soon as the Assyrian should see Samaria he would rush upon it, and destroy it. It was usual for conquerors to preserve the cities which they took in war for future use, and to make them a part of the strength or ornament of their kingdom. But Samaria was to be at once destroyed. Its inhabitants were to be carried away, and it would be demolished as greedily as a hungry man plucks and eats the first fig that ripens on the tree. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. Rather, "the fading flower, their glorious beauty (Isa 28:1), which is on the head of the fat (fertile) valley, shall be as the early fig" [G. V. Smith]. Figs usually ripened in August; but earlier ones (Hebrew bikkurah, Spanish bokkore) in June, and were regarded as a delicacy (Jer 24:2; Ho 9:10; Mic 7:1).<p>while it is yet&#8212;that is, immediately, without delay; describing the eagerness of the Assyrian Shalmaneser, not merely to conquer, but to destroy utterly Samaria; whereas other conquered cities were often spared.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">As the hasty fruit; </span> which coming before the season, and before other fruits, is most acceptable; which as soon as a man sees he covets it, and plucks it off, yet doth not long enjoy it, but through greediness devours it almost as soon as he can get it into his hand.

Such an "early fig" is a tempting delicacy, devoured as soon as seen (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-12.htm">Nahum 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-2.htm">Jeremiah 24:2</a>, etc.). The "beauty" of Samaria would tempt the Assyrians to desire it so soon as they saw it, and would rouse an appetite which would be content with nothing less than the speedy absorption of the coveted morsel. Samaria's siege, once begun, was pressed without intermission, and lasted less than three years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-9.htm">2 Kings 18:9, 10</a>) - a short space compared to that of other sieges belonging to about the same period; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, that of Ashdod, besieged twenty-nine years (Herod., 2. 157); that of Tyre, besieged thirteen years ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3:492). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet said this from out of the midst of the state of punishment, and was therefore able still further to confirm the fact, that the punishment would cease with the sin, by the punishment which followed the sin. "For the strong city is solitary, a dwelling given up and forsaken like the steppe: there calves feed, and there they lie down, and eat off its branches. When its branches become withered, they are broken: women come, make fires with them; for it is not a people of intelligence: therefore its Creator has no pity upon it, and its Former does not pardon it." The nation without any intelligence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>), of which Jehovah was the Creator and Former (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>), is Israel; and therefore the fortress that has been destroyed is the city of Jerusalem. The standpoint of the prophet must therefore be beyond the destruction of Jerusalem, and in the midst of the captivity. If this appears strange for Isaiah, nearly every separate word in these two vv. rises up as a witness that it is Isaiah, and no other, who is speaking here (compare, as more general proofs, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-13.htm">Isaiah 32:13-14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-17.htm">Isaiah 5:17</a>; and as more specific exemplifications, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-2.htm">Isaiah 16:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-7.htm">Isaiah 11:7</a>, etc.). The suffix in "her branches" refers to the city, whose ruins were overgrown with bushes. Synonymous with &#1505;&#1506;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, branches (always written with dagesh in distinction from &#1505;&#1506;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;, clefts, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-21.htm">Isaiah 2:21</a>), is ka&#770;tzir, cuttings, equivalent to shoots that can be easily cut off. It was a mistake on the part of the early translators to take ka&#770;tzir in the sense of "harvest" (Vulg., Symm., Saad., though not the lxx or Luther). As ka&#770;tzir is a collective term here, signifying the whole mass of branches, the predicate can be written in the plural, tissha&#770;barna&#770;h, which is not to be explained as a singular form, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-3.htm">Isaiah 28:3</a>. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468;, in the neuter sense, points back to this: women light it &#1492;&#1488;&#1497;&#1512;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-10.htm">Malachi 1:10</a>), i.e., make with it a lighting flame (&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;) and a warming fire (&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-16.htm">Isaiah 54:16</a>). So desolate does Jerusalem lie, that in the very spot which once swarmed with men a calf now quietly eats the green foliage of the bushes that grow between the ruins; and in the place whence hostile armies had formerly been compelled to withdraw without accomplishing their purpose, women now come and supply themselves with wood without the slightest opposition. </body></html>
