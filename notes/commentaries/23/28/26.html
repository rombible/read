Afflictions are God's threshing instruments, to loosen us from the world, to part between us and our chaff, and to prepare us for use. God will proportion them to our strength; they shall be no heavier than there is need. When his end is answered, the trials and sufferings of his people shall cease; his wheat shall be gathered into the garner, but the chaff shall be burned with unquenchable fire.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For his God doth instruct him ... - Margin, 'He bindeth it in such sort as his God doth teach him.' The more correct idea is conveyed in the text. The word &#1497;&#1505;&#1512;&#1493;  yisero&#770;, properly means, he instructs, admonishes, or teaches him. The idea that skill in agriculture is communicated by God is not one that is discordant to reason, or to the general teachings of the Bible. Thus the achitectural and mechanical skill of Bezaleel and Aholiab, by which they were enabled to make the tabernacle, is said expressly to have been imparted to them by God <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/31-2.htm">Exodus 31:2-6</a>. Thus also Noah was taught how to build the ark <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-14.htm">Genesis 6:14-16</a>. We are not, indeed, to suppose that the farmer is inspired; or that God communicates to him by special revelation where, and when, and how he shall sow his grain, but the sense is, that God is the author of all his skill. He has endowed him with understanding, and taught him by his providence. It is by the study of what God teaches in the seasons, in the soil, in the results of experience and observation, that he has this art. He teaches him also by the example, the counsel, and even by the failures of others; and all the knowledge of agriculture that he has is to be traced up to God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. to discretion&#8212;in the due rules of husbandry; God first taught it to man (Ge 3:23).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The sense of the words thus rendered is this, All this he performeth by that discretion which God hath put into him; and therefore be assured that God will order all his affairs with judgment, and will in due season execute the punishments which now he threatens, and will perfect his own works.

God gives the husbandman instruction and discretion how to sow his seed, at what time, and in a proper place; for this refers to what goes before; though some think a new act is here intended, namely, threshing or beating out of corn, rendering the words, "and he" (the husbandman) "beateth it out, according to the discretion", or "judgment, his God teaches him" (h); which is expressed in general terms here, and is next particularly insisted on in the following verses <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-27.htm">Isaiah 28:27</a>. <p>(h) "Excutit illud ad eam rationem, quam Deus, ipsius docet eum", Piscator, Gataker; "vel colligat", &amp;c.

"And your covenant with death is struck out, and your agreement with Hades will not stand; the swelling scourge, when it comes, ye will become a thing trodden down to it. As often as it passes it takes you: for every morning it passes, by day and by night; and it is nothing but shuddering to hear such preaching. For the bed is too short to stretch in, and the covering too tight when a man wraps himself in it." Although ber&#305;&#772;th is feminine, the predicate to it is placed before it in the masculine form (Ges. 144). The covenant is thought of as a document; for khuppar (for obliterari (just as the kal is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-14.htm">Genesis 6:14</a> in the sense of oblinere; or in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-20.htm">Proverbs 30:20</a>, the Targum, and the Syriac, in the sense of abstergere; and in the Talmud frequently in the sense of wiping off  equals  qinne&#772;a&#774;ch, or wiping out  equals  ma&#770;chaq - which meanings all go back, along with the meaning negare, to the primary meaning, tegere, obducere). The covenant will be "struck out," as you strike out a wrong word, by crossing it over with ink and rendering it illegible. They fancy that they have fortified themselves against death and Hades; but Jehovah gives to both of these unlimited power over them. When the swelling scourge shall come, they will become to it as mirma&#770;s, i.e., they will be overwhelmed by it, and their corpses become like dirt of the streets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5</a>); &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501; has the mercha upon the penult., according to the older editions and the smaller Masora on <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-26.htm">Leviticus 8:26</a>, the tone being drawn back on account of the following &#1500;&#1493;. The strokes of the scourge come incessantly, and every stroke sweeps them, i.e., many of them, away. &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; (from &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;, construct &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;, sufficiency, abundance) followed by the infinitive, quotiescunque irruet; la&#770;qach, auferre, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-15.htm">Jeremiah 15:15</a>, and in the idiom la&#770;qach nephesh. These scourgings without end - what a painful lecture Jehovah is reading them! This is the thought expressed in the concluding words: for the meaning cannot be, that "even (raq as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-6.htm">Psalm 32:6</a>) the report (of such a fate) is alarming," as Grotius and others explain it; or the report is nothing but alarming, as Gussetius and others interpret it, since in that case &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-5.htm">Isaiah 23:5</a>) would have been quite sufficient, instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503;. There is no doubt that the expression points back to the scornful question addressed by the debauchees to the prophet in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-9.htm">Isaiah 28:9</a>, "To whom will he make preaching intelligible?" i.e., to whom will he preach the word of God in an intelligible manner? (as if they did not possess b&#305;&#772;na&#770;h without this; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#769;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>). As <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-11.htm">Isaiah 28:11</a> affirmed that Jehovah would take up the word against them, the drunken stammerers, through a stammering people; so here the scourging without end is called the shemu&#772;&#8219;a&#770;h, or sermon, which Jehovah preaches to them. At the same time, the word ha&#770;bh&#305;&#772;n is not causative here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-9.htm">Isaiah 28:9</a>, viz., "to give to understand," but signifies simply "to understand," or have an inward perception. To receive into one's comprehension such a sermon as that which was now being delivered to them, was raq-zeva&#770;&#8219;a&#770;h, nothing but shaking or shuddering (raq as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>); &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; (from which comes &#1494;&#1493;&#1506;&#1492;, or by transposition &#1494;&#1506;&#1493;&#1492;) is applied to inward shaking as well as to outward tossing to and fro. Jerome renders it "tantummodo sola vexatio intellectum dabit auditui," and Luther follows him thus: "but the vexation teaches to take heed to the word," as if the reading were &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503;. The alarming character of the lecture is depicted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-20.htm">Isaiah 28:20</a>, in a figure which was probably proverbial. The situation into which they are brought is like a bed too short for a man to stretch himself in (min as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-1.htm">2 Kings 6:1</a>), and like a covering which, according to the measure of the man who covers himself up in it (or perhaps still better in a temporal sense, "when a man covers or wraps himself up in it," cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-4.htm">Isaiah 18:4</a>), is too narrow or too tight. So would it be in their case with the Egyptian treaty, in which they fancied that there were rest and safety for them. They would have to acknowledge its insufficiency. They had made themselves a bed, and procured bed-clothes; but how mistaken they had been in the measure, how miserably and ridiculously they had miscalculated! </body></html>
