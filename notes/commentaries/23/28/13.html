Happy are those alone, who glory in the Lord of hosts himself. Hence his people get wisdom and strength for every service and every conflict. But it is only in Christ Jesus that the holy God communicates with sinful man. And whether those that teach are drunk with wine, or intoxicated with false doctrines and notions concerning the kingdom and salvation of the Messiah, they not only err themselves, but lead multitudes astray. All places where such persons have taught are filled with errors. For our instruction in the things of God, it is needful that the same precept and the same line should be often repeated to us, that we may the better understand them. God, by his word, calls us to what is really for our advantage; the service of God is the only true rest for those weary of the service of sin, and there is no refreshment but under the easy yoke of the Lord Jesus. All this had little effect upon the people. Those who will not understand what is plain, but scorn and despise it as mean and trifling, are justly punished. If we are at peace with God, we have, in effect, made a covenant with death; whenever it comes, it cannot do us any real damage, if we are Christ's. But to think of making death our friend, while by sin we are making God our enemy, is absurd. And do not they make lies their refuge who trust in their own righteousness, or to a death-bed repentance? which is a resolution to sin no more, when it is no longer in their power to do so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But the word of the Lord was unto them - Or, rather, but the word of Yahweh "shall be" unto them.

They had complained <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-9.htm">Isaiah 28:9-10</a> that his instructions had been like a short lesson constantly repeated, as we instruct children. God here says that it should be as they said it was - they would be carried away to a distant land, and long abide among strangers; they would have ample time there to acquire instruction, and all that they would receive would be lesson after lesson of the same kind - line upon line, one judgment following another, until the lesson of their disobedience had been fully inculcated, and they had been brought to true repentance.<p>Here a little, and there a little - So they had said <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-10.htm">Isaiah 28:10</a> the lessons of God were to them by the prophets.

Was despised and derided by them; they took the prophet's words out of his mouth, and in a scoffing manner repeated them; which, in the Hebrew text, is in a rhyming form, and were sung and drawled out by them, "Tsau lotsau, Tsau lotsau, Kau lakau, Kau lakau": this is all he can say to us, and we have from him: <p>precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little; or the words may be rendered, "and the word of the Lord was unto them precept upon precept", &amp;c.; as it had been, so it still was; the same method was continued to be taken with them, and they still treated as children; and it is suggested that they should remain so, and not be men in understanding; and that they should be ever learning like children, and never come to the knowledge of the truth. Moreover, the words may be rendered, "though the word of the Lord was unto them precept upon precept", &amp;c.; though it was delivered in so plain and easy a manner to them, and such methods of instruction were used gradually and gently, to instil knowledge into them, yet so stupid were they as not to receive it, and so perverse and stubborn as wilfully to reject it; hence they were given up to judicial blindness and hardness, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-8.htm">Romans 11:8</a>, <p>that they might go and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken: go on in their own sinful ways, backslide from God, and be broken by his judgments; and be ensnared and taken in the net of the Babylonians, and be carried by them into captivity; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13</a> compare with this <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-44.htm">Matthew 21:44</a> or rather fall into the hands of the Romans, and be taken and dispersed by them among the nations. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/28.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But the word of the <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> LORD was to them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, <i>and</i> there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.</span><p>(o) Because they will not receive the word of God, when it is offered, it comes of their own malice, if after their hearts are so hardened, that they care not for it, as before, Isa 6:9.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/28.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">But the word of the Lord was</span>] Render: <span class="bld">And</span> (<span class="bld">so</span>) <span class="bld">the word of Jehovah shall be</span>—all that they had scoffingly said about Isaiah’s message (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-10.htm" title="For precept must be on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, and there a little:">Isaiah 28:10</a></span>), a monotonous, intolerable, yet unavoidable, succession of judgments (cf. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-19.htm" title="From the time that it goes forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.">Isaiah 28:19</a></span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that they might … backward</span>] <span class="bld">that they may go and stumble backwards</span> (cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/6-11.htm" title="Then said I, Lord, how long?

It is uncertain whether the reference is to the immediate future and to the Assyrians proper only, or whether the Babylonians are not taken into account also, and their oppression of Judaea pointed to. The yoke of Babylon was probably quite as difficult to endure as that of Assyria; and we find that, in the space of eighteen years, it produced at least three rebellions. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With the words, "and they also," the prophet commences the second half of the address, and passes from Ephraim to Judah. "And they also reel with wine, and are giddy with meth; priest and prophet reel with meth, are swallowed up by wine: they are giddy with meth, reel when seeing visions, stagger when pronouncing judgment. For all tables are full of filthy vomit, without any more place." The Judaeans are not less overcome with wine than the Ephraimites, and especially the rulers of Judah. In wicked violation of the law of God, which prohibited the priests from drinking strong drink when performing priestly service, and that on pain of death (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-9.htm">Leviticus 10:9</a>, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-21.htm">Ezekiel 44:21</a>), they were intoxicated even in the midst of their prophetic visions (&#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, literally "the thing seeing," then the act of seeing; equivalent to &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;, like &#1495;&#1494;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-15.htm">Isaiah 28:15</a>  equals  &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;; Olshausen, 176, c), and when passing judicial sentences. In the same way Micah also charges the prophets and priests with being drunkards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-1.htm">Micah 3:1</a>., cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>). Isaiah's indignation is manifested in the fact, that in the words which he uses he imitates the staggering and stumbling of the topers; like the well-known passage, Sta pes sta mi pes stas pes ne labere mi pes. Observe, for example, the threefold repetition of sha&#770;gu - ta&#770;ghu, sha&#770;gu - ta&#770;ghu, sha&#770;gu - pa&#770;qu. The hereditary priests and the four prophets represent the whole of the official personages. The preterites imply that drunkenness had become the fixed habit of the holders of these offices. The preposition &#1489;&#1468; indicates the cause ("through," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-28.htm">2 Samuel 13:28</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-10.htm">Esther 1:10</a>), and min the effect proceeding from the cause (in consequence of wine). In v. 8 we can hear them vomit. We have the same combination of the and &#1510; in the verb kotzen, Gothic kozan. All the tables of the carousal are full, without there being any further room (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8</a>); everything swims with vomit. The prophet paints from nature, here without idealizing. He receives their conduct as it were in a mirror, and then in the severest tones holds up this mirror before them, adults though they were. </body></html>
