We have, as it were, an excerpt from the “Georgics<span class= "ital">” </span>of Palestine. Identification in such cases is not always easy; but I follow Mr. Carruthers (<span class= "ital">Bible Educator, </span>i. 38) in reading “fennel seed” for the “fitches” of the English version. This, proverbially among the smallest of seeds, so as to be a type of the microscopic unseen, was scattered broadcast; “cummin,” also proverbial for its smallness, was sown by a like process, with some technical variation, indicated by the use of the Hebrew words. Wheat and barley were “dropped in” more deliberately by the hand of the sower, and then (instead of “the rie in their place”), <span class= "ital">“vetches for the borders thereof,” </span>these being used in the East as a kind of herbaceous hedge round the field of corn. The point of the enumeration is that the wise tiller of the soil is discriminating in his methods, and deals with each seed according to its nature. So is it, the prophet suggests through the parable which he does not interpret, with the great Husbandman, whose field is the world, and for whom the nations are as seed.

Thus the Lord, who has given men this wisdom, is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in his working. As the occasion requires, he threatens, corrects, spares, shows mercy, or executes vengeance. Afflictions are God's threshing instruments, to loosen us from the world, to part between us and our chaff, and to prepare us for use. God will proportion them to our strength; they shall be no heavier than there is need. When his end is answered, the trials and sufferings of his people shall cease; his wheat shall be gathered into the garner, but the chaff shall be burned with unquenchable fire.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When he hath made plain ... - That is, when he has leveled, or made smooth the surface of the ground by harrowing, or rolling it.<p>Doth he not scatter abroad - He does not sow one kind of grain merely, but different species according to the nature of the soil, or according to his wishes in regard to a crop.<p>The fitches - (&#1511;&#1510;&#1495;  qetsach). Vulgate, Gith; a kind of cockle (Nigella Romana), an herb of sweet savor. Septuagint, &#x39c;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  Mikron melanthion. The word 'fitch' denotes a small species of pea. The Hebrew word, however, which occurs nowhere else but here, probably denotes fennel, or dill, an herb whose seed the ancients mixed with their bread in order to give it a more agreeable relish.<p>And scatter the cummin - (&#1499;&#1502;&#1503;  kammo&#770;n). Vulgate, Cyminum - 'Cummin.' Septuagint, &#x39a;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  Kuminon - also 'Cummin.' The word properly denotes an annual plant whose seeds have a bitterish warm taste with an aromatic flavor (Webster). The seeds of this plant were used as a condiment in sauces.<p>And cast in the principal wheat - Margin, 'The wheat in the principal place.' Vulgate, Per ordinem - 'In its proper order, place, proportion.' So Lowth, 'In due measure.' So Aben Ezra and Kimchi render it, 'By measure;' and they suppose it means that if too much wheat be sown on the land, it will grow too thick, and that the spires will crowd and suffocate each other. Our translators have rendered the word &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;  s'o&#770;ra&#770;h, 'principal,' as if it were derived from &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1492;  s'a&#770;ra&#770;h, "to rule," and seem to have supposed that it denoted wheat that was especially excellent, or distinguished for its good qualities. Gesenius supposes that it means 'fat wheat,' from an Arabic signification of the word. Probably the word is designed to denote "quality," and to convey the idea that wheat is the principal, or chief grain that is sown; it is that which is most valued and esteemed.<p>And the appointed barley - The barley is a well-known grain. The word rendered 'appointed' (&#1504;&#1505;&#1502;&#1503;  nisema&#770;n), occurs nowhere else in the Scriptures. Castellio, Taylor, Grotius, Calvin, our translators, and others, suppose that it is derived from a Hebrew word which does not now occur - &#1505;&#1502;&#1503;  sa&#770;man, "to designate, to mark, to seal;" and that it means barley that had been put aside and marked as especially excellent, or seed-barley. In Chaldee, the word &#1505;&#1502;&#1503;  simman occurs in the sense of "to seal, to mark, to designate" (Chaldee Par. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/17-3.htm">Numbers 17:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-13.htm">2 Kings 9:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/5-1.htm">Esther 5:1</a>). The Septuagint, translated it &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  kengchron, and the Vulgate, Aquila, and Theodotion, understand the word as denoting a species of grain, the millet. The idea is probably that expressed by Grotius, and in our version - of barley that had been selected as seed-barley on account of its excellent quality.<p>And the rye - Margin, 'Spelt.' The word usually denotes "spelt" - a kind of wheat now found in Flanders and Italy, called German wheat. It may, however, denote rye.<p>In their place - literally, 'In the border.' Septuagint, &#x395;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  En tois horiois sou - 'In thy borders.' The idea seems to be that the spelt or rye was sown in the borders of the field while the wheat was sown in the middle; or that the rye was sown in its "proper bounds," or in the places which were adapted to it, and best suited to promote its growth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. face&#8212;the "surface" of the ground: "made plain," or level, by harrowing.<p>fitches&#8212;rather, "dill," or "fennel"; Nigella romana, with black seed, easily beaten out, used as a condiment and medicine in the East.

The Targum is, <p>"as wheat is sown in an uncultivated field, and barley by the signs, and rye by the borders;'' <p>but the whole is intended to express the wisdom of the husbandman, in sowing different seeds, not in the same field, which was forbidden by the law, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-19.htm">Leviticus 19:19</a> but in ground suitable to each of them; and in the mystical sense designs the execution of divine judgments on men, in proportion to their sins, after they have been admonished of them, and reproved for them; and may be applied also to the sowing of the seed of the word in the hearts of men, and illustrated by the parable of the sower in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-19.htm">Matthew 13:19</a>. <p>(c) So Junius &amp; Tremellius, and Piscator.

"And your covenant with death is struck out, and your agreement with Hades will not stand; the swelling scourge, when it comes, ye will become a thing trodden down to it. As often as it passes it takes you: for every morning it passes, by day and by night; and it is nothing but shuddering to hear such preaching. For the bed is too short to stretch in, and the covering too tight when a man wraps himself in it." Although ber&#305;&#772;th is feminine, the predicate to it is placed before it in the masculine form (Ges. 144). The covenant is thought of as a document; for khuppar (for obliterari (just as the kal is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-14.htm">Genesis 6:14</a> in the sense of oblinere; or in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-20.htm">Proverbs 30:20</a>, the Targum, and the Syriac, in the sense of abstergere; and in the Talmud frequently in the sense of wiping off  equals  qinne&#772;a&#774;ch, or wiping out  equals  ma&#770;chaq - which meanings all go back, along with the meaning negare, to the primary meaning, tegere, obducere). The covenant will be "struck out," as you strike out a wrong word, by crossing it over with ink and rendering it illegible. They fancy that they have fortified themselves against death and Hades; but Jehovah gives to both of these unlimited power over them. When the swelling scourge shall come, they will become to it as mirma&#770;s, i.e., they will be overwhelmed by it, and their corpses become like dirt of the streets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5</a>); &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501; has the mercha upon the penult., according to the older editions and the smaller Masora on <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-26.htm">Leviticus 8:26</a>, the tone being drawn back on account of the following &#1500;&#1493;. The strokes of the scourge come incessantly, and every stroke sweeps them, i.e., many of them, away. &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; (from &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;, construct &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;, sufficiency, abundance) followed by the infinitive, quotiescunque irruet; la&#770;qach, auferre, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-15.htm">Jeremiah 15:15</a>, and in the idiom la&#770;qach nephesh. These scourgings without end - what a painful lecture Jehovah is reading them! This is the thought expressed in the concluding words: for the meaning cannot be, that "even (raq as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-6.htm">Psalm 32:6</a>) the report (of such a fate) is alarming," as Grotius and others explain it; or the report is nothing but alarming, as Gussetius and others interpret it, since in that case &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-5.htm">Isaiah 23:5</a>) would have been quite sufficient, instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503;. There is no doubt that the expression points back to the scornful question addressed by the debauchees to the prophet in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-9.htm">Isaiah 28:9</a>, "To whom will he make preaching intelligible?" i.e., to whom will he preach the word of God in an intelligible manner? (as if they did not possess b&#305;&#772;na&#770;h without this; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#769;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>). As <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-11.htm">Isaiah 28:11</a> affirmed that Jehovah would take up the word against them, the drunken stammerers, through a stammering people; so here the scourging without end is called the shemu&#772;&#8219;a&#770;h, or sermon, which Jehovah preaches to them. At the same time, the word ha&#770;bh&#305;&#772;n is not causative here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-9.htm">Isaiah 28:9</a>, viz., "to give to understand," but signifies simply "to understand," or have an inward perception. To receive into one's comprehension such a sermon as that which was now being delivered to them, was raq-zeva&#770;&#8219;a&#770;h, nothing but shaking or shuddering (raq as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>); &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; (from which comes &#1494;&#1493;&#1506;&#1492;, or by transposition &#1494;&#1506;&#1493;&#1492;) is applied to inward shaking as well as to outward tossing to and fro. Jerome renders it "tantummodo sola vexatio intellectum dabit auditui," and Luther follows him thus: "but the vexation teaches to take heed to the word," as if the reading were &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503;. The alarming character of the lecture is depicted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-20.htm">Isaiah 28:20</a>, in a figure which was probably proverbial. The situation into which they are brought is like a bed too short for a man to stretch himself in (min as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-1.htm">2 Kings 6:1</a>), and like a covering which, according to the measure of the man who covers himself up in it (or perhaps still better in a temporal sense, "when a man covers or wraps himself up in it," cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-4.htm">Isaiah 18:4</a>), is too narrow or too tight. So would it be in their case with the Egyptian treaty, in which they fancied that there were rest and safety for them. They would have to acknowledge its insufficiency. They had made themselves a bed, and procured bed-clothes; but how mistaken they had been in the measure, how miserably and ridiculously they had miscalculated! </body></html>
