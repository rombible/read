(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-23.htm" title="For you shall be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.">Job 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-18.htm" title="And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.">Hosea 2:18</a>.) Cheyne quotes Lucan, ix. 394, <span class= "ital">Pax illis cum morte data est </span>(They have made peace with death”). “Hell” is the Hebrew Sheol (Hades), the region of the dead. The two are joined together, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-14.htm" title="I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be your plagues; O grave, I will be your destruction: repentance shall be hid from my eyes.">Hosea 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/20-13.htm" title="And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.">Revelation 20:13-14</a>.<p><span class= "bld">When the overflowing scourge . . .</span>—The words probably implied a sneer at the imagery which the prophet had used, painting the Assyrian invasion first as a flood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/8-7.htm" title="Now therefore, behold, the Lord brings up on them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:">Isaiah 8:7-8</a>), and then as a scourge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-24.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwell in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite you with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against you, after the manner of Egypt.">Isaiah 10:24</a>). (Comp, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-2.htm" title="Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.">Isaiah 28:2</a>.) The scorners think that their “lies” will give them a refuge from the danger under either form.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:5-15 The prophet next turns to Judah, whom he calls the residue of his people. Happy are those alone, who glory in the Lord of hosts himself. Hence his people get wisdom and strength for every service and every conflict. But it is only in Christ Jesus that the holy God communicates with sinful man. And whether those that teach are drunk with wine, or intoxicated with false doctrines and notions concerning the kingdom and salvation of the Messiah, they not only err themselves, but lead multitudes astray. All places where such persons have taught are filled with errors. For our instruction in the things of God, it is needful that the same precept and the same line should be often repeated to us, that we may the better understand them. God, by his word, calls us to what is really for our advantage; the service of God is the only true rest for those weary of the service of sin, and there is no refreshment but under the easy yoke of the Lord Jesus. All this had little effect upon the people. Those who will not understand what is plain, but scorn and despise it as mean and trifling, are justly punished. If we are at peace with God, we have, in effect, made a covenant with death; whenever it comes, it cannot do us any real damage, if we are Christ's. But to think of making death our friend, while by sin we are making God our enemy, is absurd. And do not they make lies their refuge who trust in their own righteousness, or to a death-bed repentance? which is a resolution to sin no more, when it is no longer in their power to do so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We have made a covenant with death - We are not to suppose that they had formally said this, but that their conduct was as if they had said it; they lived as securely as if they had entered into a compact with death not to destroy them, and with hell not to devour them. The figure is a very bold one, and is designed to express the extraordinary stupidity of the nation. It is most strikingly descriptive of the great mass of people. They are as little anxious about death and hell as if they had made a compact with the king of terrors and the prince of darkness not to destroy them. They are as little moved by the appeals of the gospel, by the alarms of God's providence, by the preaching of his word, and by all the demonstrations that they are exposed to eternal death, as though they had proved that there was no hell, or had entered into a solemn covenant that they should be unmolested. A figure similar to this occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-23.htm">Job 5:23</a> :<p>For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field;<p>And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.<p>Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-18.htm">Hosea 2:18</a>.<p>And with hell - Hebrew, 'Sheol' - the land of shades, or of departed spirits (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>). It is nearly synonymous here with death.<p>When the overflowing scourge shall pass through - There is here, in our translation, a little confusion of metaphor, since we speak usually of an overflowing "stream," and not of an overflowing "scourge." The word 'scourge' (&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1496;  shayit&#803;) means usually "a whip, a scourge," the same as &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1496;  sho&#770;t&#803;, and then means any punishment or calamity (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-26.htm">Isaiah 10:26</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-23.htm">Job 9:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-21.htm">Job 5:21</a>. Here its means severe judgments or calamities, as overflowing like water, or inundating a people.<p>We have made lies ... - That is, they acted as if they had a safe refuge in falsehood. They sought security in false doctrines, and regarded themselves as safe from all that the prophets had denounced. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. said&#8212;virtually, in your conduct, if not in words.<p>covenant&#8212;There may be a tacit reference to their confidence in their "covenant" with the Assyrians in the early part of Hezekiah's prosperous reign, before he ceased to pay tribute to them, as if it ensured Judah from evil, whatever might befall the neighboring Ephraim (Isa 28:1). The full meaning is shown by the language ("covenant with death&#8212;hell," or sheol) to apply to all lulled in false security spiritually (Ps 12:4; Ec 8:8; Jer 8:11); the godly alone are in covenant with death (Job 5:23; Ho 2:18; 1Co 3:22).<p>overflowing scourge&#8212;two metaphors: the hostile Assyrian armies like an overwhelming flood.<p>pass through&#8212;namely, through Judea on their way to Egypt, to punish it as the protector of Samaria (2Ki 17:4).<p>lies&#8212;They did not use these words, but Isaiah designates their sentiments by their true name (Am 2:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Because ye have said</span> in your hearts, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">We have made a covenant with death, </span> and with hell are we at agreement; we are as safe from <span class="ital">death</span>, and <span class="ital">hell</span>, or the <span class="ital">grave</span>, as if they had entered into covenant with us, that they would not invade us.

The phrases are expressive of their being fearless of them, and of their confidence and assurance that they should not be hurt by them. Some interpret this of their deadly enemies, as Sennacherib king of Assyria particularly, with whom they had made peace, and had entered into a covenant of friendship and alliance, and so had nothing to fear from the threatenings of the Lord by the prophet; but Vitringa, better, of the covenant and agreement with the Romans, which the Jewish rulers were careful to observe, and thought themselves safe on account of it; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>, <p>when the overflowing scourge shall pass through; when the judgments of God shall come upon the earth, and pass through the whole world, as a chastisement and correction of men for their sins, and as a punishment for them, like a mighty torrent spreading itself, and carrying all before it; or particularly when the Assyrian monarch with his army shall pass through the land of Judea, signified, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-2.htm">Isaiah 28:2</a>, by a tempest of hail, a destroying storm, a flood of mighty waters overflowing; or rather the Roman army invading Judea: <p>it shall not come unto us; who were in the city of Jerusalem: <p>for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves; not what they themselves reckoned so, but what the prophet Isaiah, or the Lord by him, called so, whose words they used, and in whose language they spoke; meaning either their lying prophets, as Kimchi, and the false doctrines they delivered to them, promising them peace when destruction was at hand; or their idols, as Jarchi, which are falsehood, lying vanities, and work of errors; or their carnal policy, arts of dissimulation, sinful compliances, and crafty methods of acting with their enemies, by which they hoped to deceive them, and secure themselves from destruction, as others; or else their wealth and riches, got by lying and fraud, which is the sense of some interpreters; and perhaps all may be intended in which they might put their trust and confidence, and on account of them expect security from threatened evils, though no other than lies and falsehood; and the same may be observed of all outward acts of religion, rites and ceremonies, and works of righteousness done by men, in which they place their trust, and hope to be saved by them from wrath to come. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/28.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Because ye have said, We have made a <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> covenant with death, and with hell are we in agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not reach us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> falsehood have we hid ourselves:</span><p>(p) They thought they had shifts to avoid God's judgments, and that they could escape though all others perished.<p>(q) Though the prophets condemned their idols and vain fruit of falsehood and vanity, yet the wicked thought in themselves that they would trust in these things.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We have made a covenant with death</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-23.htm">Job 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-18.htm">Hosea 2:18</a>).
