Writing probably early in the reign of Hezekiah, Isaiah now looks forward to a further fulfilment in the future.<p><span class= "bld">Damascus is taken away from being a city . . .</span>—The words emphasise the result of the Assyrian invasion. The city of ancient days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-2.htm" title="And Abram said, LORD God, what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?">Genesis 15:2</a>) should lose glory and be no more worthy of the name; struck out, as it were, from the list of the great cities of the world.<p><span class= "bld">The cities of Aroer are forsaken.</span>—The LXX. and other versions seem to have followed a different text, and give, “The cities are forsaken for ever.” Taking Aroer as the right reading, we note that there were two cities of the name, one in the tribe of Reuben (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-36.htm" title="From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even to Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all to us:">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-12.htm" title="And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I to the Reubenites and to the Gadites.">Deuteronomy 3:12</a>), afterwards in the possession of Moab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-19.htm" title="O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that flees, and her that escapes, and say, What is done?">Jeremiah 48:19</a>), and the other in that of Gad, near Rabbah of Ammon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-34.htm" title="And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,">Numbers 32:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-25.htm" title="And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer that is before Rabbah;">Joshua 13:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-5.htm" title="And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lies in the middle of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:">2Samuel 24:5</a>). The present passage seems to imply a closer connection with Damascus. and therefore a more northern position than that of either of these cities. The latter of the two Just named may, however, have been in alliance with Damascus, and so have shared its fate during the Assyrian invasion. Possibly it may have been chosen for special mention on account of the significance of its name (“laid bare”) as ominous of utter ruin. The picture of the “flocks” wandering through the streets of the city reminds us of that of Babylon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-21.htm" title="But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.">Isaiah 13:21</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim.</span>—The alliance of the two kingdoms is still prominent in Isaiah’s thoughts. Both shall fall, he predicts, together; and, with a stern, grave irony, he paints the downfall of “the remnant of Syria.” It shall be “as the glory of the children of Israel,” i.e., shall be fleeting and transient as that had been proved to be. There is, perhaps, a special reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-11.htm" title="As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.">Hosea 9:11</a>, “Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-1.htm" title="The burden of Damascus.

But though “this prophecy, by its title, should relate only to Damascus, is full of much concerns, and more largely treats of, the kingdom of Samaria and the Israelites, confederated with Damascus and the Syrians against the kingdom of Judah.” It is the fourth discourse of the second book of Isaiah’s prophecies, and “was delivered probably soon after the prophecies of the seventh and eighth chapters, in the beginning of the reign of Ahaz. And it was fulfilled by Tiglath-pileser’s taking Damascus, and carrying the people captives to Kir, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-9.htm" title="And the king of Assyria listened to him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.">2 Kings 16:9</a>,) and overrunning great part of the kingdom of Israel, and carrying a great number of the Israelites also captives to Assyria: and still more fully in regard to Israel, by the conquest of the kingdom, and the captivity of the people, effected a few years after by Shalmaneser:” see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-3.htm" title="Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents.">2 Kings 17:3</a>, and Bishop Lowth. <span class="ital">Behold Damascus is taken away from being a city </span>— It was, however, afterward rebuilt, and prophesied against by Jeremiah, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-23.htm" title="Concerning Damascus.

It is strange that great conquerors should take pride in being enemies to mankind; but it is better that flocks should lie down there, than that they should harbour any in open rebellion against God and holiness. The strong holds of Israel, the kingdom of the ten tribes, will be brought to ruin. Those who are partakers in sin, are justly made partakers in ruin. The people had, by sins, made themselves ripe for ruin; and their glory was as quickly cut down and taken away by the enemy, as the corn is out of the field by the husbandman. Mercy is reserved in the midst of judgment, for a remnant. But very few shall be marked to be saved. Only here and there one was left behind. But they shall be a remnant made holy. The few that are saved were awakened to return to God. They shall acknowledge his hand in all events; they shall give him the glory due to his name. To bring us to this, is the design of his providence, as he is our Maker; and the work of his grace, as he is the Holy One of Israel. They shall look off from their idols, the creatures of their own fancy. We have reason to account those afflictions happy, which part between us and our sins. The God of our salvation is the Rock of our strength; and our forgetfulness and unmindfulness of him are at the bottom of all sin. The pleasant plants, and shoots from a foreign soil, are expressions for strange and idolatrous worship, and the vile practices connected therewith. Diligence would be used to promote the growth of these strange slips, but all in vain.

Also, Shalmaneser carried away Israel from Samaria to Assyria (2Ki 17:6; 18:10, 11) in the sixth year of Hezekiah of Judah (the ninth year of Hoshea of Israel).

The eye of the prophet travels northwards from Moab, and, passing over Ammon as an enemy of small account, rests once more upon Damascus, already threatened in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1 - 9</a>, and probably already partially punished. Damascus is seen once more in alliance with Ephraim (ver. 3), and the two are joined with a new power, Aroer (ver. 2), which possesses several "cities." Woe is denounced on all the three powers: desolation on Damascus and Aroer; on Damascus and Ephraim, the complete loss of the last shadow of independence. The Assyrian inscriptions point out, as the probable date of the prophecy, the commencement of Sargun's reign - about  <span class="date">B.C. 722</span> or 721. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Damascus is taken away from being a city</span>. According to Vitringa, Damascus has been destroyed oftener than any other town; but it has a wonderful power of rising again from its ashes. Probably a destruction by Sargon is here intended ('Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 6). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The beauties of nature and fruitfulness of the land, which come into the possession of any nation, are gifts from the riches of divine goodness, remnants of the paradisaical commencement of the history of man, and types of its paradisaical close; and for this very reason they are not matters of indifference to the spirit of prophecy. And for the same reason, it is not unworthy of a prophet, who predicts the renovation of nature and the perfecting of it into the beauty of paradise, to weep over such a devastation as that of the Moabitish vineyards which was now passing before his mind (cf., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-12.htm">Isaiah 32:12-13</a>). "Therefore I bemoan the vines of Sibmah with the weeping of Jazer; I flood thee with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh, that Hdad hath fallen upon thy fruit-harvest and upon thy vintage." A tetrastich, the Hebrew equivalent, in measure and movement, of a sapphic strophe. The circumstantiality of the vision is here swallowed up again by the sympathy of the prophet; and the prophecy, which is throughout as truly human as it is divine, becomes soft and flowing like an elegy. The prophet mingles his tears with the tears of Jazer. Just as the latter weeps for the devastated vines of Sibmah, so does he also weep. The form &#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1498;, transposed from &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;&#1498;  equals  &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; (cf., Ewald, 253, a, where it is explained as being a rare "voluntative" formation), corresponds to the elegiac tone of the whole strophe. Heshbon and Elealeh, those closely connected cities, with their luxuriant fields (shedemoth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8</a>), are now lying in ruins; and the prophet waters them with tears, because hedad has fallen upon the fruit-harvest and vintage of both the sister cities. In other instances the term ka&#770;tz&#305;&#772;r is applied to the wheat-harvest; but here it is used in the same sense as ba&#770;tz&#305;&#772;r, to which it is preferred on account of Isaiah's favourite alliteration, viz., with kaytz (compare, for example, the alliteration of mistor with se&#772;ther in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-6.htm">Isaiah 4:6</a>). That it does not refer to the wheat-harvest here, but to the vintage, which was nearly coincident with the fruit-harvest (which is called kaytz, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-4.htm">Isaiah 28:4</a>), is evident from the figure suggested in the word he&#772;da&#770;d, which was the shout raised by the pressers of the grapes, to give the time for moving their feet when treading out the wine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-10.htm">Isaiah 16:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-30.htm">Jeremiah 25:30</a>). A he&#772;da&#770;d of this kind had fallen upon the rich floors of Heshbon-Elealeh, inasmuch as they had been trodden down by enemies - a Hedad, and yet no Hedad, as Jeremiah gives it in a beautiful oxymoron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-33.htm">Jeremiah 48:33</a>), i.e., no joyous shout of actual grape-treaders. </body></html>
