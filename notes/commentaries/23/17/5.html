It is strange that great conquerors should take pride in being enemies to mankind; but it is better that flocks should lie down there, than that they should harbour any in open rebellion against God and holiness. The strong holds of Israel, the kingdom of the ten tribes, will be brought to ruin. Those who are partakers in sin, are justly made partakers in ruin. The people had, by sins, made themselves ripe for ruin; and their glory was as quickly cut down and taken away by the enemy, as the corn is out of the field by the husbandman. Mercy is reserved in the midst of judgment, for a remnant. But very few shall be marked to be saved. Only here and there one was left behind. But they shall be a remnant made holy. The few that are saved were awakened to return to God. They shall acknowledge his hand in all events; they shall give him the glory due to his name. To bring us to this, is the design of his providence, as he is our Maker; and the work of his grace, as he is the Holy One of Israel. They shall look off from their idols, the creatures of their own fancy. We have reason to account those afflictions happy, which part between us and our sins. The God of our salvation is the Rock of our strength; and our forgetfulness and unmindfulness of him are at the bottom of all sin. The pleasant plants, and shoots from a foreign soil, are expressions for strange and idolatrous worship, and the vile practices connected therewith. Diligence would be used to promote the growth of these strange slips, but all in vain.

The sense in this passage is plain. As the farmer cuts down and collects his grain and removes it from the harvest field, so the enemies of Ephraim would come and remove the people and their wealth to a distant land. This received a complete fulfillment when the ten tribes were removed by the Assyrians to a distant land. This was done by Tiglath-pileser <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>, and by Shalmaneser <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>.<p>And reapeth the ears with his arm - As he collects the standing grain with one arm so that he can cut it with the sickle in the other hand.

In passing from Bethlehem to Jerusalem, it lies on the left, and descends gradually to the southwest, until it contracts in that direction into a deeper and narrower valley, called wady el-Werd, which unites further on with wady Ahmed, and finds its way to the Mediterranean. The plain extends nearly to Jerusalem, and is terminated by a slight rocky ridge forming the brow of the valley of Hinnom (see Josephus, "Ant." vii. 4. 1; viii. 12. 4; also Robinson's "Bib.

"This is the word which Jehovah spake long ago concerning Moab. And now Jehovah speaketh thus: In three years, like years of a hireling, the glory of Moab is disgraced, together with all the multitude of the great; a remnant is left, contemptibly small, not great at all." The time fixed is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3</a>. Of working time the hirer remits nothing, and the labourer gives nothing in. The statement as to the time, therefore, is intended to be taken exactly: three years, not more, rather under than over. Then will the old saying of God concerning Moab be fulfilled. Only a remnant, a contemptible remnant, will be left (&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;, cf., &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1513;&#1474;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-6.htm">Isaiah 8:6</a>, in sense equivalent to &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;); for every history of the nations is but the shadow of the history of Israel.<p>The massa in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1-16:12</a> was a word that had already gone forth from Jehovah "long ago." This statement may be understood in three different senses. In the first place, Isaiah may mean that older prophecies had already foretold essentially the same concerning Moab. But what prophecies? We may get an answer to this question from the prophecies of Jeremiah concerning Moab in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48.htm">Jeremiah 48</a>. Jeremiah there reproduces the massa Moab of the book of Isaiah, but interweaves with it reminiscences (1.) out of the ma&#770;shal on Moab in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-27.htm">Numbers 21:27-30</a>; (2.) out of Balaam's prophecy concerning Moab in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>; (3.) out of the prophecy of Amos concerning Moab (<a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/2-1.htm">Amos 2:1-3</a>). And it might be to these earlier words of prophecy that Isaiah here refers (Hvernick, Drechsler, and others). But this is very improbable, as there is no ring of these earlier passages in the massa, such as we should expect if Isaiah had had them in his mind. Secondly, Isaiah might mean that <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>. contained the prophecy of an older prophet, which he merely brought to remembrance in order to connect therewith the precise tenor of its fulfilment which had been revealed to him. This is at present the prevailing view. Hitzig, in a special work on the subject (1831), as well as in his Commentary, has endeavoured to prove, on the ground of <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>, that in all probability Jonah was the author of the oracle which Isaiah here resumes. And Knobel, Maurer, Gustav Baur, and Thenius agree with him in this; whilst De Wette, Ewald, and Umbreit regard it as, at any rate, decidedly non-Messianic. If the conjecture that Jonah was the author could but be better sustained, we should heartily rejoice in this addition to the history of the literature of the Old Testament. But all that we know of Jonah is at variance with such a conjecture. He was a prophet of the type of Elijah and Elisha, in whom the eloquence of a prophet's words was thrown altogether into the shade by the energy of a prophet's deeds. His prophecy concerning the restoration of the kingdom of Israel to its old boundaries, which was fulfilled by the victories of Jeroboam II, we cannot therefore imagine to have been so pictorial or highly poetical as the massa Moab (which would only be one part of that prophecy) really is; and the fact that he was angry at the sparing of Nineveh harmonizes very badly with its elegiac softness and its flood of tears. Moreover, it is never intimated that the conquerors to whom Moab was to succumb would belong to the kingdom of Israel; and the hypothesis is completely overthrown by the summons addressed to Moab to send tribute to Jerusalem. But the conclusion itself, that the oracle must have originated with any older prophet whatever, is drawn from very insufficient premises. No doubt it is a thing altogether unparalleled even in Isaiah, that a prophecy should assume so thoroughly the form of a kinah, or lamentation; still there are tendencies to this in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-4.htm">Isaiah 22:4</a> (cf., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-3.htm">Isaiah 21:3-4</a>), and Isaiah was an inexhaustible master of language of every character and colour. It is true we do light upon many expressions which cannot be pointed out anywhere else in the book of Isaiah, such as baale&#772; goyim, heda&#770;d, yela&#770;la&#770;h, ya&#770;ra&#8219;, yithra&#770;h, ma&#770;hir, me&#772;tz, nosa&#770;photh, pekudda&#770;h (provision, possession); and there is something peculiar in the circular movement of the prophecy, which is carried out to such an extent in the indication of reason and consequence, as well as in the perpetually returning, monotonous connection of the sentences by ci (for) and &#8219;al-ce&#772;n (la&#770;ce&#772;n, therefore), the former of which is repeated twice in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>, three times in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-8.htm">Isaiah 15:8-9</a>, and four times in succession in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5-6</a>. But there is probably no prophecy, especially in chapters 13-23, which does not contain expressions that the prophet uses nowhere else; and so far as the conjunctions ci and a&#8219; l-ce&#772;n (la&#770;ce&#772;n), are concerned, Isaiah crowds them together in other passages as well, and here almost to monotony, as a natural consequence of the prevailing elegiac tone. Besides, even Ewald can detect the characteristics of Isaiah in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-1.htm">Isaiah 16:1-6</a>; and you have only to dissect the whole rhetorically, syntactically, and philologically, with the carefulness of a Caspari, to hear throughout the ring of Isaiah's style. And whoever has retained the impression which he brought with him from the oracle against Philistia, will be constrained to say, that not only the stamp and outward form, but also the spirit and ideas, are thoroughly Isaiah's. Hence the third possible conjecture must be the correct one. Thirdly, then, Isaiah may mean that the fate of Moab, which he has just proclaimed, was revealed to him long ago; and the addition made now is, that it will be fulfilled in exactly three years. &#1502;&#1488;&#1494; does not necessarily point to a time antecedent to that of Isaiah himself (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-8.htm">Isaiah 44:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-3.htm">Isaiah 48:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-5.htm">Isaiah 48:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-7.htm">Isaiah 48:7</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-34.htm">2 Samuel 15:34</a>). If we assume that what Isaiah predicts down to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-12.htm">Isaiah 16:12</a> was revealed to him in the year that Ahaz died, and that the epilogue reckons from the third or tenth year of Hezekiah, in either case the interval is long enough for the me&#770;'a&#770;z (from of old). And we decide in favour of this. Unfortunately, we know nothing certain as to the time at which the three years commence. The question whether it was Shalmanassar, Sargon, or Sennacherib who treated the Moabites so harshly, is one that we cannot answer. In Herodotus (ii. 141), Sennacherib is called "king of the Arabians and Assyrians;" and Moab might be included in the Arabians. In any case, after the fulfilment of Isaiah's prophecy in the Assyrian times, there was still a portion left, the fulfilment of which, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48.htm">Jeremiah 48</a>, was reserved for the Chaldeans. </body></html>
