Numbers flock to her, and she is assured that they come to be a comfort to her. There are times when the church is desolate and few in number; yet its desolations shall not last for ever, and God will repair them. God can raise up friends for returning Israelites, even among Gentiles. They shall bring their children, and make them thy children. Let all deal tenderly and carefully with young converts and beginners in religion. Princes shall protect the church. It shall appear that God is the sovereign Lord of all.

The R.V. gets over the difficulty by taking “thy waste places” &c. as a sort of <span class="ital">casus pendens</span>, resumed in the “thou” of the last clause; but this is a forced construction.

Palestine, after the return from the Captivity, was at no time over-populated; and when the conversion of the Gentiles took place it caused no influx of fresh settlers into the Holy Land. The object of the prophet is simply to mark the vast growth of the Church, which would necessarily spread itself far beyond the limits of Palestine, and would ultimately require the whole earth for its habitation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/49.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this return of the exiles from every quarter of the globe to their fatherland, and for this mighty work of God on behalf of His church, which has been scattered in all directions, the whole creation is to praise Him. "Sing, O heavens; and shout, O earth; and break out into singing, O mountains! for Jehovah hath comforted His people, and He hath compassion upon His afflicted ones." The phrase &#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1495;, like &#1493;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1503; &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1495; (which occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-4.htm">Psalm 98:4</a> as well as in Isaiah), is peculiarly Isaiah's (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-7.htm">Isaiah 14:7</a>, and several times in chapters 40-66). "The afflicted ones" (&#8219;a&#774;niyy&#305;&#772;m) is the usual Old Testament name for the ecclesia militans. The future alternates with the perfect: the act of consolation takes place once for all, but the compassion lasts for ever. Here again the glorious liberty of the children of God appears as the focus from which the whole world is glorified. The joy of the Israel of God becomes the joy of heaven and earth. With the summons to this joy the first half of the prophecy closes; for the word &#1514;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, which follows, shows clearly enough that the prophecy has merely reached a resting-point here, since this word is unsuitable for commencing a fresh prophecy. </body></html>
