Numbers flock to her, and she is assured that they come to be a comfort to her. There are times when the church is desolate and few in number; yet its desolations shall not last for ever, and God will repair them. God can raise up friends for returning Israelites, even among Gentiles. They shall bring their children, and make them thy children. Let all deal tenderly and carefully with young converts and beginners in religion. Princes shall protect the church. It shall appear that God is the sovereign Lord of all. And those who in the exercise of faith, hope, and patience, wait on God for the fulfilment of his promises, shall never be confounded.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/49.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And kings shall be thy nursing fathers - Margin, 'Nourishers.' That is, they would patronize the church of God; they would protect it by their laws, and foster it by their influence and become the personal advocates of the cause of Zion. The idea is properly that of guarding, educating, and proriding for children; and the sense is that kings and princes would evince the same tender care for the interests of the people of God which a parent or a nurse does for a child. It is needless to say that this has been already to a considerable extent fulfilled, and that many princes and monarchs have been the patrons of the church, though doubtless it is destined to a more ample fulfillment still in the brighter days of this world's history, when the gospel shall spread everywhere. It is remarkable that, in the Sandwich and South Sea Islands, the Christian religion has been uniformly, almost, taken under the protection of the kings and chiefs since its first introduction there, and has been carried forward and extended under their direct authority.<p>They shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth - A posture indicating the profoundest reverence. This is the common posture of showing great respect in the East.<p>And lick up the dust of thy feet - An act denoting the utmost possible respect and veneration for the church and people of God.<p>For they shall not be ashamed that wait for me - They who worship me shall not be ashamed of the act requiring the deepest self-abasement, to show their reverence for me.

The expressions are borrowed from the practice of the Eastern people in their prostrations and adorations, when they bowed so low as to touch and kiss the ground, whereby they did or might seem to lick up the very dust of the ground which was about or under the feet of those whom they adored. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They shall not be ashamed that wait for me; </span> their hopes and expectations shall not be disappointed, but abundantly satisfied. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/49.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers,.... Who shall show favour and respect to the church and people of God, grant them liberty, and protect and defend them in their religious privileges: for this is to be understood not figuratively of apostles and apostolical men, as Jerom, who are kings and priests unto God, and who feed the church with the milk of the word, and the breasts of ordinances; but literally of the kings and queens of the earth; and is thought to have had its fulfilment, at least in part, in Cyrus, Ahasuerus, Esther, and others; but more so in Christian kings and queens, as Constantine and Helena, Theodosius and Placilla, and others; and will have a far greater accomplishment in the latter day glory; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>, <p>they shall bow down toward thee with their faces toward the earth; which expresses the great veneration and respect these great personages shall have for the church of God, and their entire submission and subjection to the Gospel of Christ, and the ordinances of it, and to the laws and discipline of his house; for they shall now become members of the Christian church, and be entirely under the government of it, as to religious things; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-9.htm">Revelation 3:9</a>. <p>and lick up the dust of thy feet; the allusion is to the eastern nations, especially the Persians, who, in the adoration of their kings, used to kiss the ground they stood on, and seemed to lick, if they did not, the dust that was about them; and it expresses the very low submission of kings and princes to the church, and their high veneration of it; their willingness to do the meanest office for the good of it, and their great regard and affection for the meanest of its members, the dust of Zion; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/72-9.htm">Psalm 72:9</a>, <p>and thou shalt know that I am the Lord; the King of kings, and Lord of lords, who has the hearts of all men, even of kings, in his hands, and can turn them, and bring them to a thorough submission to his will; and who is able to accomplish all his promises, and is true and faithful to them; this will be known and owned by the church, when the above things have their accomplishment: <p>for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me; or for my salvation, as the Targum; for favours from him; for the light of his countenance; for the discoveries and application of pardoning grace; for the performance of promises; for answers of prayer; for his spiritual coming, and for eternal glory and happiness; these shall not be ashamed of him for whom they wait, nor of their hope and expectation of him, nor at his coming. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/49.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And kings <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow to thee with <i>their</i> face toward the earth, and lick up the <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I <i>am</i> the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.</span><p>(b) Meaning, that kings will be converted to the gospel, and bestow their power and authority for the preservation of the Church.<p>(c) Being joined with the Church, they will humble themselves to Christ their head, and give him all honour.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/49.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="ital">thy nursing fathers</span>] <span class="bld">thy guardians</span>; i.e. of course, the guardians of her children (in spite of ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-16.htm" title="You shall also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shall suck the breast of kings: and you shall know that I the LORD am your Savior and your Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.">Isaiah 60:16</a>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-12.htm" title="Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that you should say to me, Carry them in your bosom, as a nursing father bears the sucking child, to the land which you swore to their fathers?">Numbers 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-1.htm" title="And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria.

"Thy children make haste, thy destroyers and masters draw out from thee. Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all these assemble themselves together, and come to thee. As truly as I live, saith Jehovah, thou wilt put them all on like jewellery, and gird them round thee like a bride." The pointing adopted by the lxx, Targ., Jer. and Saad., is &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;. The antithesis favours this reading; but &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; suits <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-19.htm">Isaiah 49:19</a> better; and the thought that Zion's children come and restore her fallen walls, follows of itself from the very antithesis: her children come; and those who destroyed their maternal home, and made it a desolate ruin, have to depart from both city and land. Zion is to lift up her eyes, that have been cast down till now, yea, to lift them up round about; for on all sides those whom she thought she had lost are coming in dense crowds &#1500;&#1498; (cf., &#1500;&#1488;  equals  &#1500;&#1493; with &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-5.htm">Isaiah 49:5</a>), to her, i.e., henceforth to belong to her again.

The population which Zion recovers once more, will be to her like the ornaments which a woman puts on, like the ornamental girdle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-20.htm">Isaiah 3:20</a>) which a bride fastens round her wedding dress. </body></html>
