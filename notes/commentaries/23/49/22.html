A standard, or an ensign was erected in times of war to rally the forces of a nation around it; and the sense here is, that God would erect an ensign high in the sight of all the nations, and would call them to himself, as a military leader musters his forces for battle; that is, he would call the nations to embrace the true religion. See this phrase explained in the the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>.<p>They shall bring thy sons in their arms - Margin, 'Bosom.' Jerome renders it, In ulnis - 'In their arms.' The Septuagint, &#x395;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#837;  En kolpo&#772; - 'In the bosom.' Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, &#x391;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  Agkalas - 'In their arms.' If it means bosom, as Gesenius renders it, it refers to the bosom of a garment in which things are carried. But it more probably means in the arms, as children are borne; and the idea is, that the distant nations would come and bear with them those who were the children of Zion, that is, those who would become the true friends and worshippers of God.<p>And thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders - Referring, doubtless, to the manner in which children were carried. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-12.htm">Isaiah 66:12</a>, the same idea is expressed by their being carried upon the sides, referring to the custom still prevalent in the East, of placing a child when it is nursed astride on the side of the mother. The following quotation will more fully explain the customs here alluded to. 'It is a custom in many parts of the East, to carry their children astride upon the hip, with the arm around the body. In the kingdom of Algiers, where the slaves take the Children out, the boys ride upon their shoulders; and in a religious procession, which Symes had an opportunity of seeing at Ava, the capital of the Burman empire, the first personages of rank that passed by were three children borne astride, on people's shoulders. It is evident, from these facts, that the Oriental children are carried sometimes the one way, sometimes the other.<p>Nor was the custom, in reality, different in Judea, though the prophet expresses himself in these terms: "They shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders;" for, according to Dr. Russel, the children able to support themselves are usually carried astride on the shoulders; but in infancy they are carried in the arms, or awkwardly on one haunch. Dandini tells us that, on horseback, the Asiatics "carry their children upon their shoulders with great dexterity. These children hold by the head of him who carries them, whether he be on horseback or on foot, and do not hinder him from walking or doing what he pleases." This augments the import of the passage in Isaiah, who speaks of the Gentiles bringing children thus; so that distance is no objection to this mode of conveyance, since they may thus be brought on horseback from among the people, however remote.' (Paxton) 'Children of both sexes are carried on the shoulders.<p>Thus may be seen the father carrying his son, the little fellow being astride on the shoulder, having, with his hands, hold of his father's head. Girls, however, sit on the shoulder, as if on a chair, their legs banging in front, while they also, with their hands, lay hold of the head. In going to, or returning from pagan festivals, thousands of parents and their children may be thus seen marching along with joy.' (Roberts) The sense is, that converts should come from every land - that the nations should flock to the standard of the Messiah. And why may it not be regarded as a legitimate interpretation of this passage, that those who come should bring their children, their sons and their daughters, with them? That they were borne upon the arm, or upon the shoulder, is indicative of their being young children; and that is no forced interpretation of this passage which regards it as teaching, that the parents who should be converted among the Gentiles should bring their offspring to the Redeemer, and present them publicly to God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/49.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. lift &#8230; hand&#8212;that is, beckon to (see on [835]Isa 13:2).<p>standard&#8212;(Isa 11:12).<p>bring &#8230; sons in &#8230; arms&#8212;The Gentiles shall aid in restoring Israel to its own land (Isa 60:4; 66:20).

In answer to the questions, where had these children been? and from whence did they come? who begot them, and brought them up? and by what means was all this done, or would be done? <p>I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles; beckoning them to come unto him, directing and ordering them what to do; or rather exerting the power of his grace in the conversion of them. The Targum is, <p>"I will reveal my power among the Gentiles;'' <p>his efficacious grace attending the ministry of the word, whereby it becomes "the power of God unto salvation"; for when that hand is lifted up or exerted, the "word" comes "not in word only", "but in power, and in the Holy Ghost", and is effectual to saving purposes: <p>and set up my standard to the people; meaning Christ, "the ensign of the people"; who, in the ministration of the Gospel, is set up as a standard, to gather persons to him, as an ensign or standard is set up by a general of an army to collect soldiers to him, to come and enlist, and fight under his banners; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a>, <p>and they shall bring thy sons in their arms; or, "bosom" (s); such as are regenerated by the Spirit and grace of God, under the word, are to be tenderly dealt with by the ministers of the Gospel, as they are by Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a> and to be encouraged to come and join themselves to the church, and be directed and assisted by them in that service: <p>and thy daughters shall be carried on their shoulders; meaning the same as before, only perhaps weaker converts, dealing with them according to their infirmities; carrying them with as much ease, care, and tenderness, as young children are carried on the shoulders of their parents or others. It may be these expressions are designed to show how assisting and encouraging the Christian Gentiles will be to the Jews, when converted in their several countries, both to admit them into Gospel churches, and bring them into their own land; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-19.htm">Isaiah 66:19</a>. <p>(s) , Sept.

The new children - the new converts - are to come from the Gentiles; the fresh "sons" and "daughters" will be carried by the nations in their arms, and by the peoples upon their shoulders.

The period of suffering which forces out this lamentation still continues. What follows, therefore, applies to the church of the present, i.e., of the captivity. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-16.htm">Isaiah 49:16</a> "Does a woman forget her sucking child, so as not to have compassion upon the child of her womb? Even though mothers should forget, I will not forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls stand continually before me." In reply to the complaining church, which knows that her home is in Zion-Jerusalem, and which has been kept so long away from her home, Jehovah sets forth His love, which is as inalienable as a mother's love, yea, far greater than even maternal love. On &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, the min in me&#772;rache&#772;m is equivalent to &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-10.htm">Isaiah 24:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>, etc. &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;, so far as the actual sense is concerned, is equivalent to &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (Ewald, 362, b): "granted that such (mothers) should forget, i.e., disown, their love." The picture of Zion (not merely the name, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-16.htm">Isaiah 49:16</a> clearly shows) is drawn in the inside of Jehovah's hands, just as men are accustomed to burn or puncture ornamental figures and mementoes upon the hand, the arm, and the forehead, and to colour the punctures with alhenna or indigo (see Tafel, xii., in vol. ii. pp. 33-35 of Lane's Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians). There is the figure of Zion, unapproachable to every creature, as close to Him as He is to Himself, and facing Him amidst all the emotions of His divine life. There has He the walls of Zion constantly before Him (on neged, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>); and even if for a time they are broken down here below, with Him they have an eternal ideal existence, which must be realized again and again in an increasingly glorious form. </body></html>
