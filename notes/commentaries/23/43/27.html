But it is more probable that the expression is put for their forefathers collectively; and so he tells them, that as they were sinners, so also were all their progenitors, yea, even the best of them. Thus Lowth: “Your ancestors, reckoning from Adam downward, have been sinners, and you have trod in their steps:” see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-3.htm" title="And he said to me, Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even to this very day.">Ezekiel 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-2.htm" title="Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,">Ezekiel 16:2</a>, &c.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-7.htm" title="Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass to this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.">Ezra 9:7</a>. <span class="ital">And thy teachers have transgressed, </span>&c. — Your prophets, priests, and teachers, who ought to have been guides to you, and intercessors for you with God, have led you into sin and error, and therefore you have no reason to fancy yourselves innocent. <span class="ital">Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary </span>— The highest and best of your priests, whose persons were most sacred, and therefore were supposed, by themselves and others, to be the farthest from danger.

The Master tired not the servants with his commands, but they tired him with disobedience. What were the riches of God's mercy toward them? I, even I, am he who yet blotteth out thy transgressions. This encourages us to repent, because there is forgiveness with God, and shows the freeness of Divine mercy. When God forgives, he forgets. It is not for any thing in us, but for his mercies' sake, his promise' sake; especially for his Son's sake. He is pleased to reckon it his honour. Would man justify himself before God? The attempt is desperate: our first father broke the covenant, and we all have copied his example. We have no reason to expect pardon, except we seek it by faith in Christ; and that is always attended by true repentance, and followed by newness of life, by hatred of sin, and love to God. Let us then put him in remembrance of the promises he has made to the penitent, and the satisfaction his Son has made for them. Plead these with him in wrestling for pardon; and declare these things, that thou mayest be justified freely by his grace. This is the only way, and it is a sure way to peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/43.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy first father hath sinned - This is the argument on the side of God, to show that they were neither unjustly punished, nor punished with undue severity. The argument is, that their rulers and teachers had been guilty of crime, and that therefore it was right to bring all this vengeance upon the nation. Various interpretations have been given of the phrase 'thy first father.' A slight notice of them will lead to the correct exposition.<p>1. Many have supposed that Adam is referred to here. Thus Piscator, Calovius, and most of the fathers, understand it; and, among the Jews, Kimchi. But the objections to this are plain:<p>(a) Adam was not peculiarly the first father or ancestor of the Jews, but of the whole human race.<p>(b) The Jews never boasted, or gloried in him as the founder of their nation, but they always referred to Abraham under this appellation <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-33.htm">John 8:33</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>.<p>(c) It would have been irrelevant to the design of the prophet to have referred to the sin of Adam in this case. God was vindicating his own cause and conduct in destroying their capital and temple, and in sending them as captives to a distant land. How would it prove that he was right in this, to say that Adam was a transgressor? How would it demonstrate his justice in these special inflictions of his anger to refer to the apostasy of the ancestor of the whole human race?<p>2. Others refer it to Abraham. This was the sentiment of Jerome, and of some others; and by those who maintain this opinion, it is supposed to refer to his doubting the truth of the promise <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-8.htm">Genesis 15:8</a>; or to the denial of his wife, and his sin in inducing her to say that she was his sister <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-11.htm">Genesis 12:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-2.htm">Genesis 20:2</a>; or to the fact that when young he was an idolater. But the obvious objection to this is, that Abraham is everywhere in the Scriptures proposed as an example of one eminently devoted to God; nor could it be said that these calamities had come upon them in consequence of his unfaithfulness, and his sins.<p>3. Others refer it to the rulers and princes individually. Thus Grotius refers it to Manasseh; Aben Ezra to Jeroboam, etc.<p>4. Others, as Vitringa, refer it to the high priest, and particularly to Uriah, who lived in the time of Ahaz, and particularly to the fact, that, in obedience to the command of Ahaz, he constructed an altar in Jerusalem like the one which he had seen and admired in Damascus <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10-16</a>. The objection to this interpretation is, that no reason can be given for selecting this particular act from a number of similar abominations on the part of the priests and rulers, as the cause of the national calamities. It was only one instance out of many of the crimes which brought the national judgments upon them.<p>5. Others, as Gesenius, suppose that the word is to be taken collectively, not as referring to any particular individual, but to the high priests in general. It is not uncommon to give the name 'father' thus to a principal man among a people, and especially to one eminent in religious authority. The word 'first' here does not refer to time, but to rank; not the ancestor of the people, but the one having appropriately the title of father, who had the priority also in rank. The Septuagint renders it, &#x39f;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  Hoi pateres humo&#772;n pro&#772;toi. It refers therefore, probably, to the character of the presiding officers in religion, and means that the priests, supreme in rank, and whose example was so important, had sinned; that there was irreligion at the very foundation of influence and authority; and that therefore it was necessary to bring these heavy judgments on the nation. No one acquainted with the history of the Jewish people in the times immediately preceding the captivity, can doubt that this was the character of the high priesthood.<p>(Gesenius and some others give the words a collective sense, as signifying either the succession of priests or ancestors in general. The interpretation which understands the phrase of Abraham, is supposed by some to be at variance with the uniform mention of that patriarch in terms of commendation. But these terms are perfectly consistent with the proposition that he was a sinner, which may here be the exact sense of &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;  cha&#770;t&#803;a&#770;'. To the application of the phrase to Adam, it has been objected, that he was not peculiarly the father of the Jews. To this it may be answered, that if the guilt of the national progenitor would prove the point in question, much more would it be established by the fact of their belonging to a guilty race. At the same time it may be considered as implied, that all their fathers, who had since lived, shared in the original depravity; and thus the same sense is obtained that would have been expressed by the collective explanation of first father, while the latter is still taken in its strict and full sense, as denoting the progenitor of all mankind. - Alexander)<p>And thy teachers - Margin, 'Interpreters.' The word used here (&#1502;&#1500;&#1510;&#1497;&#1498;  mel&#305;&#770;ytseyka&#772;) is derived from &#1500;&#1493;&#1509;  lu&#770;ts. This word means to stammer, to speak unintelligibly; and then to speak in a foreign and barbarous language, and then to interpret, from the idea of speaking a foreign tongue. Hence, it may be used in the sense of an internuncius, or a messenger (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-31.htm">2 Chronicles 32:31</a>; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-23.htm">Job 33:23</a>). That it refers here to the priests, there can be no doubt, and is properly applied to them because they sustained the office of interpreting his will to the people, and generally of acting as internuncii or messengers between God and them. The Septuagint renders it, " &#x391;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c2;  Archontes - 'Rulers.' <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/43.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. first father&#8212;collectively for "most ancient ancestors," as the parallelism ("teachers") proves [Maurer]. Or, thy chief religious ministers or priests [Gesenius]. Adam, the common father of all nations, can hardly be meant here, as it would have been irrelevant to mention his sin in an address to the Jews specially. Abraham is equally out of place here, as he is everywhere cited as an example of faithfulness, not of "sin." However, taking the passage in its ultimate application to the Church at large, Adam may be meant.<p>teachers&#8212;literally, "interpreters" between God and man, the priests (Job 33:23; Mal 2:7).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/43.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thy first father; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Abraham, who might well be called the <span class="ital">first father</span> of the Israelites, because they all descended from him, had all their right and title to God’s ordinances and promises, and other special privileges, from God’s covenant made with Abraham and with his seed, and who is oft emphatically called their father, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-2.htm" title="And Joshua said to all the people, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelled on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.">Joshua 24:2</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-2.htm" title="Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah that bore you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.">Isaiah 51:2</a></span>, &c; and the Jews gloried in and trusted to that relation which they had to Abraham, as we read, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-9.htm" title="And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.">Matthew 3:9</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-33.htm" title="They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how say you, You shall be made free?">John 8:33</a></span>, and elsewhere. And this agrees well with the foregoing context. For having sufficiently intimated that they had no merits of their own, he now addeth, that even their father Abraham, to whose merits they trusted, had no merits of his own, nor any occasion of boasting; for he also was a sinful man, and hath left some instances of his failings. Or <span class="ital">the first father</span> may be put collectively for their forefathers; and so he tells them, that as they were sinners, so also were all their progenitors, yea, even the best of them, Abraham, and David, and others, for whose sakes they expected to be pardoned and rewarded. And this indeed is usual with God, to upbraid the Israelites with the sins of their fathers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thy teachers; </span> thy priests and prophets; who were their intercessors with God, and who were generally presumed to be the holiest part of that people; and therefore if these were transgressors, the people had no reason to fancy themselves to be innocent. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/43.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thy first father hath sinned,.... Either Adam, as Kimchi, in whom all have sinned, and from whom all derive a sinful and corrupt nature; or Abraham, as Jarchi, the father of the Jewish nation, of whom they boasted, and in whom they trusted, as being of his seed, and through whose merits and worthiness they expected great things; yet he was but a sinful man, though a good man, and a great believer; of whose infirmity and frailty many instances are on record. Some have thought Terah the father of Abraham is designed, who was an idolater; others think some particular king is meant, the father of his people; Aben Ezra supposes Jeroboam to be intended, the first king of the ten tribes who made Israel to sin; but Kimchi observes, it is better to understand it of Saul, who was the first king over all Israel; others interpret it of Ahaz; and others of Manasseh; Vitringa of Uriah the priest, in the times of Ahaz; but it seems best to take the singular for the plural, as the Arabic version does, which renders it, "your first fathers have sinned"; all their forefathers had sinned, from their coming out of Egypt to that day; and, therefore it was in vain to have respect to them, or plead any worthiness of theirs in their favour; besides, they imitated them in their sins, and were filling up the measure of their iniquities: <p>and thy teachers have transgressed against me; or "interpreters" (s); of the law to the people, the Priests and Levites, Scribes and Pharisees; such who should have taught the people, and instructed them in the knowledge of divine things, and interceded with God for them; these were transgressors of the law themselves, as well as despisers of the Gospel; these rejected the counsel of God against themselves, disbelieved the Messiah, and dissuaded the people from receiving him; they were "orators" (t), as the word is by some rendered; and they used all the oratory they were masters of against Christ, and to persuade the people into an ill opinion of him, and at last to insist upon his crucifixion. <p>(s) "interpretes tui", V.

Remember not things of olden time, nor meditate upon those of earlier times! Behold, I work out a new thing: will ye not live to see it? Yea, I make a road through the desert, and streams through solitudes. The beast of the field will praise me, wild dogs and ostriches: for I give water in the desert, streams in solitude, to give drink to my people, my chosen. The people that I formed for myself, they shall show forth my praise." What Jehovah really says commences in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-18.htm">Isaiah 43:18</a>. Then in between He is described as Redeemer out of Egypt; for the redemption out of Egypt was a type and pledge of the deliverance to be looked for out of Babylon. The participles must not be rendered qui dedit, eduxit; but from the mighty act of Jehovah in olden time general attributes are deduced: He who makes a road in the sea, as He once showed. The sea with the tumultuous waters is the Red Sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-11.htm">Nehemiah 9:11</a>); &#8219;izzu&#772;z, which rhymes with va&#770;su&#772;s, is a concrete, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/24-8.htm">Psalm 24:8</a>, the army with the heroes at its head. The expression "bringeth out," etc., is not followed by "and suddenly destroys them," but we are transported at once into the very midst of the scenes of destruction. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; shows them to us entering upon the sleep of death, in which they lie without hope (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-14.htm">Isaiah 26:14</a>). The close (kappishta&#770;h kha&#770;bhu&#772;) is iambic, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-27.htm">Judges 5:27</a>. The admonition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-18.htm">Isaiah 43:18</a> does not commend utter forgetfulness and disregard (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-9.htm">Isaiah 66:9</a>); but that henceforth they are to look forwards rather than backward. The new thing which Jehovah is in the process of working out eclipses the old, and deserves a more undivided and prolonged attention. Of this new thing it is affirmed, "even now it sprouts up;" whereas in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-9.htm">Isaiah 42:9</a>, even in the domain of the future, a distinction was drawn between "the former things" and "new things," and it could be affirmed of the latter that they were not yet sprouting up. In the passage before us the entire work of God in the new time is called cha&#774;da&#770;sha&#770;h (new), and is placed in contrast with the ri'sho&#772;no&#772;th, or occurrences of the olden time; so that as the first part of this new thing had already taken place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-9.htm">Isaiah 42:9</a>), and there was only the last part still to come, it might very well be affirmed of the latter, that it was even now sprouting up (not already, which &#1506;&#1514;&#1492; may indeed also mean, but as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-7.htm">Isaiah 48:7</a>). In connection with this, &#1514;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488; (a verbal form with the suffix, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-17.htm">Jeremiah 13:17</a>, with kametz in the syllable before the tone, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-11.htm">Isaiah 47:11</a>, in pause) does not mean, "Will ye then not regard it," as Ewald, Umbreit, and others render it; but, "shall ye not, i.e., assuredly ye will, experience it." The substance of the cha&#774;da&#770;sha&#770;h (the new thing) is unfolded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>. It enfolds a rich fulness of wonders: &#1488;&#1507; affirming that, among other things, Jehovah will do this one very especially. He transforms the pathless, waterless desert, that His chosen one, the people of God, may be able to go through in safety, and without fainting. And the benefits of this miracle of divine grace reach the animal world as well, so that their joyful cries are an unconscious praise of Jehovah. (On the names of the animals, see Khler on <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-3.htm">Malachi 1:3</a>.) In this we can recognise the prophet, who, as we have several times observed since chapter 11 (compare especially <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-23.htm">Isaiah 30:23-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-7.htm">Isaiah 35:7</a>), has not only a sympathizing heart for the woes of the human race, but also an open ear for the sighs of all creation. He knows that when the sufferings of the people of God shall be brought to an end, the sufferings of creation will also terminate; for humanity is the heart of the universe, and the people of God (understanding by this the people of God according to the Spirit) are the heart of humanity. In v. 21 the promise is brought to a general close: the people that (zu&#772; personal and relative, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-24.htm">Isaiah 42:24</a>)<p>(Note: The pointing connects &#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468; with makkeph, so that the rendering would be, "The people there I have formed for myself;" but according to our view, &#1506;&#1501; should be accented with yethib, and zu&#772; with munach. In just the same way, zu&#772; is connected with the previous noun as a demonstrative, by means of makkeph, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-13.htm">Exodus 15:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-12.htm">Psalm 62:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-4.htm">Psalm 142:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/143-8.htm">Psalm 143:8</a>, and by means of a subsidiary accent in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-2.htm">Psalm 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-8.htm">Psalm 12:8</a>. The idea which underlies <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-24.htm">Isaiah 42:24</a> appears to be, "This is the retribution that we have met with from him."'
