From which passages laid together it appears that this latter deliverance, compared with that out of Egypt, is not to be confined to their restoration from captivity, but to be extended to the consequences thereof, and especially to the redemption of the Messiah. Indeed, otherwise the deliverance from Egypt was more glorious and wonderful, in many respects, than that out of Babylon. <span class="ital">Behold, I will do a new thing </span>— Such a work as was never yet done in the world. <span class="ital">Now it shall spring forth </span>— The Scripture often speaks of things at a great distance of time, as if they were now at hand, to make us sensible of the inconsiderableness of time and all temporal things, in comparison of God and eternal things; upon which account it is said, that <span class="ital">a thousand years are in God’s sight but as one day.

The redemption of sinners by Christ, the conversion of the Gentiles, and the recall of the Jews, are described. All that is to be done to rescue sinners, and to bring the believer to glory, is little, compared with that wondrous work of love, the redemption of man.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/43.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Remember ye not ... - So great and wonderful shall be God's future interpositions in your behalf, that what he has done, great as that was, shall be comparatively forgotten.<p>The former things - The deliverance from Egypt, and the overthrow of his enemies there.<p>The things of old - The things that were formerly done. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/43.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. So wonderful shall be God's future interpositions in your behalf, that all past ones shall be forgotten in comparison. Plainly the future restoration of Israel is the event ultimately meant. Thus the "former things" are such events as the destruction of Sennacherib and the return from Babylon. "Things of old" are events still more ancient, the deliverance from Egypt and at the Red Sea, and entry into Canaan [Vitringa].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/43.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> But although your former deliverance out of Egypt was in itself a most glorious work, which you ought always to remember and consider; yet this other work of your deliverance out of Babylon by Cyrus, and those blessings which shall follow upon it, and particularly that inestimable mercy of sending the Messiah, shall be so transcendent a layout, that, in comparison thereof, all your former deliverances are scarce worthy of your remembrance and consideration. Which exposition is confirmed by two parallel texts, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-14.htm" title="Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that it shall no more be said, The LORD lives, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;">Jeremiah 16:14</a>,15 23:7,8</span>. From all which texts laid together, it appears that this latter deliverance, compared with that out of Egypt, is not to be confined to their freedom from the Babylonish captivity, but to be extended to the consequences of it, and especially to the redemption by Christ, because otherwise that Egyptian deliverance was more glorious and wonderful in many respects than the Babylonian. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/43.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Remember ye not the former things,.... Just now referred to, the bringing of Israel out of Egypt, and through the Red sea, and the drowning of Pharaoh and his army in it; for though these things were worthy to be remembered with thankfulness and praise, and to the glory of God, and for the encouragement of faith, yet not in comparison of what was hereafter to be done; meaning, not the redemption from Babylon, unless as a type of spiritual and eternal redemption by Christ; for otherwise there were greater and more wonderful things done, when Israel were brought out of Egypt, than when they were brought out of Babylon; but the great salvation by the Messiah, which exceeds both the deliverances out of Egypt and Babylon, is meant: <p>neither consider the things of old; unless as figures of the new, but not to be put upon a foot with them, much less to the undervaluing of them, and indeed to be forgotten in comparison of them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-7.htm">Jeremiah 23:7</a>. The Talmudists (q), by the "former" things, understand subjection to kingdoms; and, by the "things of old", the going out of Egypt; as they do by the "new thing", in the following verse, the war of Gog and Magog. <p>(q) T.

The old deliverance will be as nothing compared with the new. Israel must cast its eye forwards, not backwards. Mr. Cheyne well compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-7.htm">Jeremiah 23:7, 8</a>, and also well notes that "the chief glories of the second manifestation are spiritual." Israel in the wilderness was a stiff:necked and rebellious people, given to murmuring, licentiousness, and idolatry. Israel, returned from Babylon, will no more hanker after idols, but will have God's Law "put in their inward parts" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-33.htm">Jeremiah 32:33</a>), and will "show forth God's praise" (ver. 21). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/43.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The address now closes by holding up once more the object and warrant of faith. "I am Jehovah; and beside me there is no Savour. I have proclaimed and brought salvation, and given to perceive, and there was no other god among you: and ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and I am God. Even from the day onwards I am so; and there is no deliverer out of my hand: I act, and who can turn it back?" The proper name "Jehovah" is used here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-13.htm">Isaiah 43:13</a>) as a name indicating essence: "I and no other am the absolutely existing and living One," i.e., He who proves His existence by His acts, and indeed by His saving acts. &#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; and Jehovah are kindred epithets here; just as in the New Testament the name Jehovah sets, as it were, but only to rise again in the name Jesus, in which it is historically fulfilled. Jehovah's previous self-manifestation in history furnished a pledge of the coming redemption. The two synonyms &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; and &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468; have &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in the midst. He proclaimed salvation, brought salvation, and in the new afflictions was still ever preaching salvation, without there having been any za&#770;r, i.e., any strange or other god in Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-16.htm">Deuteronomy 32:16</a>; see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-10.htm">Isaiah 17:10</a>), who proved his existence in any such way, or, in fact, gave any sign of existence at all. This they must themselves confess; and therefore (Vav in sense equivalent to ergo, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-25.htm">Isaiah 40:25</a>) He, and He alone, is El, the absolutely mighty One, i.e., God. And from this time forth He is so, i.e., He, and He only, displays divine nature and divine life. There is no reason for taking &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; in the sense of &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1502;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, "from the period when the day, i.e., time, existed" (as the lxx, Jerome, Stier, etc., render it). Both the gam (also) and the future 'eph&#8219;al (I will work) require the meaning supported by <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a>, "from the day onwards," i.e., from this time forth (syn. &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-7.htm">Isaiah 48:7</a>). The concluding words give them to understand, that the predicted salvation is coming in the way of judgment. Jehovah will go forward with His work; and if He who is the same yesterday and today sets this before Him, who can turn it back, so that it shall remain unaccomplished? The prophecy dies away, like the massa&#770;' Ba&#770;bhel with its epilogue in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-27.htm">Isaiah 14:27</a>. In the first half (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1-17</a>) Jehovah introduced His servant, the medium of salvation, and proclaimed the approaching work of salvation, at which all the world had reason to rejoice. The second half (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-18.htm">Isaiah 42:18-43:13</a>) began with reproaching, and sought to bring Israel through this predicted salvation to reflect upon itself, and also upon its God, the One God, to whom there was no equal. </body></html>
