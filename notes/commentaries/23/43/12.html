Those who make them, and trust in them, are like unto them. They have the shape and faculties of men; but they have not common sense. But God's people know the power of his grace, the sweetness of his comforts, the kind care of his providence, and the truth of his promise.

The word 'god' here is not in the original, but is properly supplied. The word &#1494;&#1512;  za&#770;r is evidently used instead of &#1494;&#1512; &#1488;&#1500;  'e&#770;l za&#770;r, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-20.htm">Psalm 44:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-9.htm">Psalm 81:9</a>. It denotes a god that is worshipped by foreigners. The sense is, that their former deliverance could in no sense be traced to any such foreign god.<p>Therefore, ye are my witnesses - You who have so often been defended; you who have the predictions respecting future events, can be appealed to as evidence that I am the only true God, able to deliver. The doctrine taught in this passage is, that God may appeal to his dealings with his people as a demonstration that he is the true God, and that he is faithful and able to deliver - an appeal which may be made to his church at large in view of its trials, persecutions, and deliverances; and to every one who is his true friend and worshipper. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/43.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. declared&#8212;predicted the future (Isa 41:22, 23).<p>saved&#8212;the nation, in past times of danger.<p>showed&#8212;namely, that I was God.<p>when &#8230; no strange god, &c.&#8212;to whom the predictions uttered by Me could be assigned.

The Targum is, <p>"I have showed to Abraham your father what should come to pass; I redeemed you out of Egypt, as I swore to him between the pieces; and I caused you to hear the doctrine of the law at Sinai.'' <p>But the sense is, that God had declared by his prophets, long before the Messiah came, that he would send him; that he should come and save his people by his obedience, sufferings, and death; accordingly he was come, and was the author of salvation; the Lord had wrought out salvation by him, as he had declared he would; and this he had shown, published, and made known by the everlasting Gospel, preached among all nations: <p>when there was no strange god among you; that assisted in this salvation; the arm of Christ alone wrought it out: or, "and this is not strange among you" (i); this work of salvation wrought out is not strange among you; it is well known unto you, being published in the Gospel. <p>(i)   "et non est in vobis alienum vel peregrinum", Musculus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/43.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, that I am God.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/43.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">have declared … saved … shewed</span>] The arrangement of the verbs is peculiar. Some would remove the second, others the third, as dittography. But if there be any error in the text it is more likely the omission of a fourth word, which would be parallel to “saved,” as “shewed” is to “declared” (so Duhm).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">when</span> there was <span class="ital">no strange</span> god] Rather as R.V. <span class="bld">and there was no strange</span> (i.e. foreign) <span class="bld">god</span>. There cannot be an allusion to an early period of the history, before idolatry had crept in; because the deliverance is conceived as having just taken place. It is true that many “strange gods” had been acknowledged in Israel; but none of them was really there, as a living active presence in their midst. The meaning is, “It was I who did this, and no god who was a stranger among you.” <span class="ital">strange god</span> is strictly “stranger,” as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-16.htm" title="They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.">Deuteronomy 32:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-25.htm" title="Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst: but you said, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.">Jeremiah 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-13.htm" title="Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed against the LORD your God, and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed my voice, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 3:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">therefore ye</span> are … <span class="ital">that I</span> am <span class="ital">God</span>] Render: <span class="bld">and ye are my witnesses, and I am God</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have declared</span>, etc. Translate, <span class="accented">I announced</span>, <span class="accented">and delivered</span>, <span class="accented">add proclaimed</span> (<span class="accented">the deliverance</span>), <span class="accented">when there was no strange god among you</span>; 1.e I did what the idol-gods cannot do - announced deliverance, and effected it, and further proclaimed (or published) it, at the time when you Israelites had no idolatry among you. The allusion is to the deliverance of Jerusalem from Sennacherib, which God announced by the mouth of Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-33.htm">Isaiah 37:33-35</a>), effected by the hand of his angel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>), and then caused to be published by Isaiah, who wrote the two accounts of the deliverance - both that in his own prophecy, and that in the Second Book of Kings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-20.htm">2 Kings 19:20-35</a>). At that time there was no (open) idolatry in Judah, since Hezekiah had destroyed the idols (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>). Therefore ye are my witnesses<span class="cmt_word">... </span> that I am God; literally, <span class="accented">and ye are my witnesses</span>, <span class="accented">and I am</span> God. Ye can bear witness of the truth of what I have asserted in the previous portion of the verse, and your witness to this effect proves me to be God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/43.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The encouraging "Fear not" is here resumed, for the purpose of assigning a still further reason. "Fear not; for I am with thee: I bring thy seed from the east, and from the west will I gather them; I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the end of the earth; everything that is called by my name, and I have created for my glory, that I have formed, yea finished!" The fact that Jehovah is with Israel will show itself in this, that He effects its complete restoration from all quarters of the heaven (compare the lands of the diaspora in all directions already mentioned by Isaiah in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11-12</a>). Jehovah's command is issued to north and south to give up their unrighteous possession, not to keep it back, and to restore His sons and daughters (compare the similar change in the gender in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>), which evidently implies the help and escort of the exiles on the part of the heathen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-2.htm">Isaiah 14:2</a>). The four quarters and four winds are of the feminine gender. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-7.htm">Isaiah 43:7</a> the object is more precisely defined from the standpoint of sacred history. The three synonyms bring out the might, the freeness, and the riches of grace, with which Jehovah called Israel into existence, to glorify Himself in it, and that He might be glorified by it. They form a climax, for &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488; signifies to produce as a new thing; &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;, to shape what has been produced; and &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, to make it perfect or complete, hence creavi, formavi, perfeci. </body></html>
