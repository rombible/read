Their calling and election had not been cancelled, and they might yet fulfil it. They, in that restoration from exile which Isaiah had foretold, should be a living proof of the foresight granted to the prophets, and, therefore, of the foreknowledge of Him who alone could say, “I am He,” to whom past, present, and future were as one; and He, the Eternal, proclaims Himself as being also the only Saviour.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/43.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>43:8-13 Idolaters are called to appear in defence of their idols. Those who make them, and trust in them, are like unto them. They have the shape and faculties of men; but they have not common sense. But God's people know the power of his grace, the sweetness of his comforts, the kind care of his providence, and the truth of his promise. All servants of God can give such an account of what he has wrought in them, and done for them, as may lead others to know and believe his power, truth, and love<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/43.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye are my witnesses - They were his witnesses, because, first, he had given in them predictions of future events which had been literally fulfilled: secondly, by his power of delivering them so often manifested, he had shown that he was a God able to save. Neither of these had been done by the idol-gods (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-8.htm">Isaiah 44:8</a>).<p>And believe me - Or rather, confide in me.<p>Before me there was no God formed - I am the only true, the eternal God. In this expression, Yahweh says that he was the first being. He derived his existence from no one. Perhaps the Hebrew will bear a little more emphasis than is conveyed by our translation. 'Before me, God was not formed,' implying that he was God, and that he existed anterior to all other beings. It was an opinion among the Greeks, that the same gods had not always reigned, but that the more ancient divinities had been expelled by the more modern. It is possible that some such opinion may have prevailed in the oriental idolatry, and that God here means to say, in opposition to that, that he had not succeeded any other God in his kingdom. His dominion was original, underived, and independent.<p>Neither shall there be after me - He would never cease to live; he would never vacate his throne for another. This expression is equivalent to that which occurs in the Book of Revelation, 'I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last' <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11</a>; and it is remarkable that this language, which obviously implies eternity, and which in Isaiah is used expressly to prove the divinity of Yahweh, is, in the passage referred to in the Book of Revelation, applied no less unequivocally to the Lord Jesus Christ. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/43.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

And withal he calleth them <span class="ital">formed gods</span>, in way of contempt, and to show the ridiculousness of their pretence to the Divinity, which are formed by the hands of men. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/43.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord,.... The people of Israel, who could testify that the Lord had foretold their affliction in Egypt, their coming from thence, and settling in the land of Canaan, many hundreds of years before they came to pass, and which were exactly fulfilled; and so the apostles of Christ, and ministers of the word, and all Christian people in all nations, are witnesses of the prophecies concerning Christ, his birth, miracles, obedience, sufferings, death, resurrection, ascension to heaven, and session at the right hand of God, all which are exactly accomplished, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, <p>and my servant whom I have chosen; meaning either the Prophet Isaiah, or the prophets in general; or rather the Messiah. So the Targum, <p>"and my servant the Messiah, in whom I am well pleased;'' <p>and who is called the faithful witness, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>, and to whom the characters of a servant, and the Lord's chosen, well agree, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>, <p>that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he; by which testimonies and evident proofs of deity, from the prediction of future events, and the accomplishment of them, you may have a competent knowledge, a firm persuasion, and a clear perception of this important truth, that the God of Israel, and of all true Christians, is the one only Lord God: <p>before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me; intimating that idols were formed by the hands of men, and yet none of these were formed before him, and therefore could make no pretensions to deity, or to an equality with him; nor should any be formed afterwards, that could be put in competition with him. In short, the sense is, there is no other god beside him; as the Targum, Septuagint, and Arabic versions render it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/43.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Ye <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> <i>are</i> my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I <i>am</i> he: before me there was no god formed, neither shall there be after me.</span><p>(l) The prophets and people to whom I have given my law.<p>(m) Meaning especially Christ, and by him all the faithful.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/43.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. The gods are unable to meet the challenge, and Jehovah turns to His servant Israel, whose very presence is evidence of His power both to predict and to deliver. The words <span class="ital">and my servant</span> are not a complement of the subject (“ye are my witnesses, and [so is] my Servant”) but of the predicate (<span class="bld">ye are my witnesses and</span> [ye are] <span class="bld">my Servant</span>). The former view would imply some sort of distinction between the Servant and Israel, whether of an individual over against the nation, or of a part of the nation over against the whole. But whatever view may be held of the personality of the Servant, the natural construction of the sentence places it alongside of those numerous passages where the title is applied to Israel. To bear witness to Jehovah’s divinity is one of the functions of Israel as the Servant of the Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that ye may know</span> …] In the very act of bearing witness, it would seem that the mind of Israel is to be awakened to the grand truth of which its own history is the evidence,—the sole divinity of Jehovah, and its own unique position as His servant.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I am he</span>] See ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-4.htm" title="Who has worked and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.">Isaiah 41:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">before me there was no god formed</span>] Strictly, of course, the idea is, “before any god was formed I existed.” The form of expression might be derived from the Babylonian cosmology, according to which the gods were the first beings to emerge from the primeval chaos. The following words occur in the Chaldæan account of creation: “When of the gods none had yet arisen, when none named a name or [determined] fate; <span class="ital">then were the</span> [<span class="ital">great</span>] <span class="ital">gods formed</span>” (Schrader, <span class="ital">Cuneiform Inscriptions</span> on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.">Genesis 1:1</a>). It is probably to this origin of the gods themselves that reference is made, rather than to the formation of their images (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-9.htm" title="They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.">Isaiah 44:9</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye are my witnesses</span>, <span class="cmt_word">saith the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Ye, Israel, are the witnesses that I cite" - ye can prove the antiquity of the historical books of Scripture by the ordinary modes by which antiquity is proved, and also the exact dates of the prophetical sues. Ye can show what clear and unambiguous prophecies have been delivered centuries before the event, as the destruction of Jerusalem by a nation in whom none can fail to recognize the Romans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49-57</a>), prophesied by Moses; the demolition of the altar at Bethel by a king of the house of David, Josiah by name, prophesied by a man of God in the reign of Jeroboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>); the long continuance of David's progeny upon the throne of Judah, prophesied by Nathan in David's time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11-16</a>); the fairly long continuance of the house of Jehu on the throne of Israel, prophesied to Jehu himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-30.htm">2 Kings 10:30</a>); and the like. Israel has been at all times, and still is, one of the most important witnesses for God that exists in the world. Like the Church, Israel is the "witness and keeper" of a large portion of "Holy Writ." Her past history witnesses for God. Her continued existence and present condition constitute additional testimony. <span class="cmt_word">And my Servant whom I have chosen</span>. To explain this as meaning "and ye are also my servant, whom I have chosen" (Nagelsbach, Cheyne, Delitzsch), is to empty it of all its force. Manifestly, a further witness is adduced, "Ye are my witnesses; and so is my Servant," etc. The "Servant" intended can only be the one true Servant of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1-7</a>, since faithful Israel is already among the witnesses. The prophet rises above the consideration of the immediately present, or of the single trial-scene which he is setting before us, and has in mind the great controversy ever going on between those who are for God and those who are against him. He sees, on the side of God <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> faithful Israel: and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Christ, the "Faithful Witness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>), who "came into the world that he should bear witness of the truth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>). These are the two witnesses by whom God's truth is maintained in a world of falsehood and delusion. <span class="cmt_word">That ye may know</span>. The subject is changed. "Ye" here points to "the nations," or mankind at large. I am he (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-4.htm">Isaiah 41:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Before me there was no God formed</span>. All other gods beside me are "formed" gods - invented, fashioned, made by men. None of them was ever made before me. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beside me there is no saviour</span>. None but God can save men. Man cannot make atonement for his fellows; "for it cost more to redeem their souls, so that he must let that alone for ever" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-8.htm">Psalm 49:8</a>, Prayer-book Version). The human "saviours" whom God raises up to deliver his people out of the hand of their enemies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-5.htm">2 Kings 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-27.htm">Nehemiah 9:27</a>, etc.), are "saviours" in quite a secondary and inferior sense. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/43.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>, k&#305;&#772; (for), with all that follows, assigns the reason for the encouraging "Fear not;" so here a second k&#305;&#772; introduces the reason for the promise which ensures them against the dangers arising from either water or fire. "For I Jehovah am thy God; (I) the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I give up Egypt as a ransom for thee, Ethiopia and Seba in thy stead. Because thou art dear in my eyes, highly esteemed, and I loved thee; I give up men in thy stead, and peoples for thy life." Both "Jehovah" and "the Holy One of Israel" are in apposition to "I" ('a&#774;n&#305;&#772;), the force of which is continued in the second clause. The preterite na&#770;thatt&#305;&#772; (I have given), as the words "I will give" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-4.htm">Isaiah 43:4</a> clearly show, states a fact which as yet is only completed so far as the purpose is concerned. "A ransom:" ko&#772;pher (&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;) is literally the covering - the person making the payment. &#1505;&#1489;&#1488; is the land of Mero, which is enclosed between the White and Blue Nile, the present Dr Sennr, district of Sennr (Sen-rti, i.e., island of Sen), or the ancient Meriotic priestly state settled about this enclosed land, probably included in the Mudrya (Egypt) of the Achaemenidian arrowheaded inscriptions; though it is uncertain whether the Kusiya (Heb. Ku&#772;sh&#305;&#772;m) mentioned there are the predatory tribe of archers called &#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; (Strabo, xi. 13, 6), whose name has been preserved in the present Chuzistan, the eastern Ethiopians of the Greeks (as Lassen and Rawlinson suppose), or the African Ethiopians of the Bible, as Oppert imagines. The fact that Egypt was only conquered by Cambyses, and not by Cyrus, who merely planned it (Herod. i. 153), and to whom it is only attributed by a legend (Xen. Cyr. viii. 6, 20, &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c8;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x391;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), does no violence to the truth of the promise. It is quite enough that Egypt and the neighbouring kingdoms were subjugated by the new imperial power of Persia, and that through that empire the Jewish people recovered their long-lost liberty. The free love of God was the reason for His treating Israel according to the principle laid down in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-8.htm">Proverbs 11:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-18.htm">Proverbs 21:18</a>. &#1502;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; does not signify ex quo tempore here, but is equivalent to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-23.htm">Jeremiah 44:23</a>; for if it indicated the terminus a quo, it would be followed by a more distinct statement of the fact of their election. The personal pronoun "and I" (va'a&#774;n&#305;&#772;) is introduced in consequence of the change of persons. In the place of &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (perf. cons.), &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; commended itself, as the former had already been used in a somewhat different function. All that composed the chosen nation are here designated as "man" (a&#770;da&#770;m), because there was nothing in them but what was derived from Adam. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; has here a strictly substitutionary meaning throughout. </body></html>
