The redemption of sinners by Christ, the conversion of the Gentiles, and the recall of the Jews, are described. All that is to be done to rescue sinners, and to bring the believer to glory, is little, compared with that wondrous work of love, the redemption of man.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/43.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will do a new thing - Something that has not hitherto occurred, some unheard of and wonderful event, that shall far surpass all that he had formerly done (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-9.htm">Isaiah 42:9</a>).<p>Now it shall spring forth - (See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-9.htm">Isaiah 42:9</a>).

"I will open a way, not merely in the Red Sea, but in the wilderness of the whole world; and not merely one river shall gush out of the rock, but many, which shall refresh, not the bodies as formerly, but the souls of the thirsty, so that the prophecy shall be fulfilled: 'With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation'" [Jerome]. "A way" often stands for the true religion (Ac 9:2; 18:26). "Rivers" express the influences of the Holy Spirit (Joh 7:37-39). Israel's literal restoration hereafter is included, as appears by comparing Isa 11:15, 16.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/43.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A new thing; </span> such a work as was never yet done in the world, even the redemption of the world by the Messiah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Now; </span> shortly, although it was not to be done till after some hundreds of years.

It is, of course, quite possible that the novelty is not <span class="accented">merely</span> in the circumstances of the deliverance, but extends to all its results, among which is the Messianic kingdom - verily, a "new thing" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-22.htm">Jeremiah 31:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Now it shall spring forth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">already it is springing up</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-9.htm">Isaiah 42:9</a>).

Events are shaping themselves  -  the deliverance approaches. <span class="cmt_word">Shall ye not know it?</span> rather, <span class="accented">will ye not give heed to it</span>? Will not the exiled people, whom Isaiah addresses, turn their thoughts this way, and let the idea of deliverance take possession of their minds, instead of brooding on past and present sufferings (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-30.htm">Isaiah 40:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-17.htm">Isaiah 41:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-22.htm">Isaiah 42:22</a>)? <span class="cmt_word">God is about to make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert</span>. As he led his people out of their Egyptian bondage, first through the Red Sea, and then through a "howling wilderness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>), so now he will "make a way" for them through a still more desolate tract. We are nowhere historically told by what route the Israelites ultimately returned. If they went by Tadmor and Damascus, they must have traversed a most arid and difficult desert. Even if they did not quit the Euphrates till they reached the latitude of Aleppo, still they must have had some wide tracts of wilderness to cross. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/43.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The address now closes by holding up once more the object and warrant of faith. "I am Jehovah; and beside me there is no Savour. I have proclaimed and brought salvation, and given to perceive, and there was no other god among you: and ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and I am God. Even from the day onwards I am so; and there is no deliverer out of my hand: I act, and who can turn it back?" The proper name "Jehovah" is used here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-13.htm">Isaiah 43:13</a>) as a name indicating essence: "I and no other am the absolutely existing and living One," i.e., He who proves His existence by His acts, and indeed by His saving acts. &#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; and Jehovah are kindred epithets here; just as in the New Testament the name Jehovah sets, as it were, but only to rise again in the name Jesus, in which it is historically fulfilled. Jehovah's previous self-manifestation in history furnished a pledge of the coming redemption. The two synonyms &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; and &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468; have &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in the midst. He proclaimed salvation, brought salvation, and in the new afflictions was still ever preaching salvation, without there having been any za&#770;r, i.e., any strange or other god in Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-16.htm">Deuteronomy 32:16</a>; see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-10.htm">Isaiah 17:10</a>), who proved his existence in any such way, or, in fact, gave any sign of existence at all. This they must themselves confess; and therefore (Vav in sense equivalent to ergo, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-25.htm">Isaiah 40:25</a>) He, and He alone, is El, the absolutely mighty One, i.e., God. And from this time forth He is so, i.e., He, and He only, displays divine nature and divine life. There is no reason for taking &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; in the sense of &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1502;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, "from the period when the day, i.e., time, existed" (as the lxx, Jerome, Stier, etc., render it). Both the gam (also) and the future 'eph&#8219;al (I will work) require the meaning supported by <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a>, "from the day onwards," i.e., from this time forth (syn. &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-7.htm">Isaiah 48:7</a>). The concluding words give them to understand, that the predicted salvation is coming in the way of judgment. Jehovah will go forward with His work; and if He who is the same yesterday and today sets this before Him, who can turn it back, so that it shall remain unaccomplished? The prophecy dies away, like the massa&#770;' Ba&#770;bhel with its epilogue in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-27.htm">Isaiah 14:27</a>. In the first half (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1-17</a>) Jehovah introduced His servant, the medium of salvation, and proclaimed the approaching work of salvation, at which all the world had reason to rejoice. The second half (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-18.htm">Isaiah 42:18-43:13</a>) began with reproaching, and sought to bring Israel through this predicted salvation to reflect upon itself, and also upon its God, the One God, to whom there was no equal. </body></html>
