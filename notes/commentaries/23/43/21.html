The redemption of sinners by Christ, the conversion of the Gentiles, and the recall of the Jews, are described.

The Gentiles, compared to a desert and wilderness, wild and uncultivated, distinguished from Jacob and Israel in the next verse, and the same with the chosen people before mentioned; who being chosen of God, and redeemed by Christ, are formed anew by the Spirit of Christ, made new creatures, regenerated, and transformed by the renewing of their minds, and conformed to the image of Christ, and having him formed in their souls, and principles of grace and holiness wrought in them; in consequence of which they reformed in their lives and conversation, and were also formed into a Gospel church state, and all this done by the Lord for himself, his service, and his glory. The Targum is, <p>"this people have I prepared for my worship:'' <p>they shall show forth my praise; with their lips, by ascribing their formation to the power and grace of God, and even their whole salvation to it, and express their thankfulness for the same; and likewise by their actions, by a subjection to the ordinances of the Gospel, and by their lives and conversations being agreeably to it. Joseph Kimchi, as Abendana observes, interprets this people of the beasts of the field, spoken of in the preceding verse, that should honour the Lord, and here said to be formed for himself, and should show forth his praise; and which is taken notice of to aggravate the sins of the people of the Jews, who called not on the Lord, &amp;c. as in the following verses; so the ants and conies are called a people not strong, and the locusts a people great and strong, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-25.htm">Proverbs 30:25</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/43.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/43.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>.

It reads: <span class="bld">The people which I have formed for myself, they shall tell forth my praise</span>. As the “streams in the desert” were created for Israel and not for the “beasts of the field,” so it is Israel alone that can fully celebrate the praises of the Lord, Who is its Redeemer (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-9.htm" title="But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This people have I formed for myself</span> (see above, ver. 7, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-4.htm">Proverbs 16:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They shall show forth my praise</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> their restoration to their own land shall cause them to glorify me both with songs of praise (for the fulfilment, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-9.htm">Ezra 3:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-27.htm">Nehemiah 12:27</a>; and the post-Captivity psalms), and also by a life in accordance with my laws. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/43.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In close connection with the foregoing prophecy, the present one commences with the dissolution of the Chaldean empire. "Thus saith Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, For your sake I have sent to Babel, and will hurl them all down as fugitives, and the Chaldeans into the ships of their rejoicing. I, Jehovah, am your Holy One; (I) Israel's Creator, your King." Hitzig reads &#1489;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, and adopts the rendering, "and drowned the shouting of the Chaldeans in groaning." Ewald also corrects <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-14.htm">Isaiah 43:14</a> thus: "And plunge their guitars into groanings, and the rejoicing of the Chaldeans into sighs." We cannot see any good taste in this un-Hebraic bombast. Nor is there any more reason for altering &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1497;&#1495;&#1501; (lxx &#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;) into &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1497;&#1495;&#1501; (Jerome, vectes), as Umbreit proposes: "and make all their bolts<p>(Note: This would require &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;.)<p>fall down, and the Chaldeans, who rejoice in ships" (ba&#772;o&#774;niyo&#772;th). None of these alterations effect any improvement. For your sakes, says Jehovah, i.e., for the purpose of releasing you, I have sent to Babylon (sc., the agents of my judgments, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-3.htm">Isaiah 13:3</a>), and will throw them all down (viz., the &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; of this market of the world; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-14.htm">Isaiah 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-15.htm">Isaiah 47:15</a>) as fugitives (ba&#770;r&#305;&#772;ch&#305;&#772;m with a fixed kametz, equivalent to barr&#305;&#772;ch&#305;&#772;m), i.e., into a hurried flight; and the Chaldeans, who have been settled there from a hoary antiquity, even they shall be driven into the ships of their rejoicing (bo&#774;o&#774;niyo&#772;th, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-14.htm">Proverbs 31:14</a>), i.e., the ships which were previously the object of their jubilant pride and their jubilant rejoicing. &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; stands in the perf. consec., as indicating the object of all the means already set in motion. The ships of pleasure are not air-balloons, as Hitzig affirms. Herodotus (i. 194) describes the freight ships discharging in Babylon; and we know from other sources that the Chaldeans not only navigated the Euphrates, but the Persian Gulf as well, and employed vessels built by Phoenicians for warlike purposes also.<p>(Note: See G. Rawlinson, Monarchies, i. 128, ii.448.)<p>&#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491; itself might indeed signify "to hurl to the ground" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-12.htm">Psalm 59:12</a>); but the allusion to ships shows that &#1489;&#1468; &#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491; are to be connected (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-14.htm">Isaiah 63:14</a>), and that a general driving down both by land and water to the southern coast is intended. By thus sweeping away both foreigners and natives out of Babylon into the sea, Jehovah proves what He is in Himself, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-15.htm">Isaiah 43:15</a>, and also in His relation to Israel; we must supply a repetition of &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-15.htm">Isaiah 43:15</a>), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-3.htm">Isaiah 43:3</a>. The congregation which addresses Him as the Holy One, the people who suffer Him to reign over them as their King, cannot remain permanently despised and enslaved. </body></html>
