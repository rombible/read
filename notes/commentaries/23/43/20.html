God would pour such copious floods of waters through the waste sandy deserts to supply his people, that even the wild beasts would be sensible of his abundant goodness, and would break forth into thanksgiving and praise for the unusual supply.<p>The dragons - (See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-22.htm">Isaiah 13:22</a>). The Septuagint renders the word used here (&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;  tann&#305;&#770;yn), by &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  seire&#772;nes - 'sirens' - among the ancients a marine monster that was fabled to use sweet and alluring tones of music. It is probable, however, that the Septuagint understood here some species of wild-fowl which responded to one another. The Syriac translator here interprets it as denoting some wild animal of the canine species - a wood-dog.<p>And the owls - Margin, as Hebrew, 'Daughters of the owl, or ostrich' (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/43.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. beast&#8212;image of idolaters, defiled with blood and pollutions, dwelling like dragons, &c., in the wastes of Gentile ignorance: even they shall be converted.

The recent mention of the desert causes animals of the desert (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21, 22</a>) to be taken as examples. (On the animals intended, see the comment on Isaiah 34:13.) If even the beasts of the desert honoured God, much more would the rest of the animal creation (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-8</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/43.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In close connection with the foregoing prophecy, the present one commences with the dissolution of the Chaldean empire. "Thus saith Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, For your sake I have sent to Babel, and will hurl them all down as fugitives, and the Chaldeans into the ships of their rejoicing. I, Jehovah, am your Holy One; (I) Israel's Creator, your King." Hitzig reads &#1489;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, and adopts the rendering, "and drowned the shouting of the Chaldeans in groaning." Ewald also corrects <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-14.htm">Isaiah 43:14</a> thus: "And plunge their guitars into groanings, and the rejoicing of the Chaldeans into sighs." We cannot see any good taste in this un-Hebraic bombast. Nor is there any more reason for altering &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1497;&#1495;&#1501; (lxx &#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;) into &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1497;&#1495;&#1501; (Jerome, vectes), as Umbreit proposes: "and make all their bolts<p>(Note: This would require &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;.)<p>fall down, and the Chaldeans, who rejoice in ships" (ba&#772;o&#774;niyo&#772;th). None of these alterations effect any improvement. For your sakes, says Jehovah, i.e., for the purpose of releasing you, I have sent to Babylon (sc., the agents of my judgments, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-3.htm">Isaiah 13:3</a>), and will throw them all down (viz., the &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; of this market of the world; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-14.htm">Isaiah 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-15.htm">Isaiah 47:15</a>) as fugitives (ba&#770;r&#305;&#772;ch&#305;&#772;m with a fixed kametz, equivalent to barr&#305;&#772;ch&#305;&#772;m), i.e., into a hurried flight; and the Chaldeans, who have been settled there from a hoary antiquity, even they shall be driven into the ships of their rejoicing (bo&#774;o&#774;niyo&#772;th, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-14.htm">Proverbs 31:14</a>), i.e., the ships which were previously the object of their jubilant pride and their jubilant rejoicing. &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; stands in the perf. consec., as indicating the object of all the means already set in motion. The ships of pleasure are not air-balloons, as Hitzig affirms. Herodotus (i. 194) describes the freight ships discharging in Babylon; and we know from other sources that the Chaldeans not only navigated the Euphrates, but the Persian Gulf as well, and employed vessels built by Phoenicians for warlike purposes also.<p>(Note: See G. Rawlinson, Monarchies, i. 128, ii.448.)<p>&#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491; itself might indeed signify "to hurl to the ground" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-12.htm">Psalm 59:12</a>); but the allusion to ships shows that &#1489;&#1468; &#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491; are to be connected (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-14.htm">Isaiah 63:14</a>), and that a general driving down both by land and water to the southern coast is intended. By thus sweeping away both foreigners and natives out of Babylon into the sea, Jehovah proves what He is in Himself, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-15.htm">Isaiah 43:15</a>, and also in His relation to Israel; we must supply a repetition of &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-15.htm">Isaiah 43:15</a>), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-3.htm">Isaiah 43:3</a>. The congregation which addresses Him as the Holy One, the people who suffer Him to reign over them as their King, cannot remain permanently despised and enslaved. </body></html>
