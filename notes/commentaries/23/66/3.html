Now the prophet declares that there may be as real an apostasy beneath an orthodox creed and an irreproachable ritual. Each act of the hypocrite’s worship is as an idolatrous abomination.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/66.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-3.htm" title="He that kills an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrifices a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offers an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he that burns incense, as if he blessed an idol.

The declaration is most important, but will not be understood unless by those who are well acquainted with the interior part of religion.” See Vitringa. Solomon, it may be observed, gives (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-8.htm" title="The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright is his delight.">Proverbs 15:8</a>) a short but full commentary on the whole verse: <span class="ital">The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord. He that sacrificeth a lamb as if he cut off a dog’s neck </span>— Namely, in order to sacrifice it. This animal was held in the greatest abhorrence by the Jews, insomuch that the very price of a dog was forbidden to be brought into the house of the Lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-18.htm" title="You shall not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the LORD your God for any vow: for even both these are abomination to the LORD your God.">Deuteronomy 23:18</a>. The comparison shows God’s detestation of ceremonial performances from persons destitute of true piety. <span class="ital">He that offereth, &c., as if he offered swine’s blood </span>— Which, being one of the principal sacrifices which the heathen offered to their idols, was in a particular manner abominable to God. <span class="ital">He that burneth incense as if he blessed an idol </span>— As if he honoured an idol with gifts and presents. From hence it is plain that the prophet is not here reflecting upon <span class="ital">idolatrous worship, </span>but <span class="ital">formal worship; </span>for to say, He that burneth incense <span class="ital">to an idol </span>is <span class="ital">as he that blesseth an idol, </span>would be only to say, He that blesseth an idol, blesseth an idol; that is, it would be saying nothing. But he is reflecting upon those who, in a formal way, and not in spirit and in truth, worshipped the true God, and by acts which he had appointed. God, by the prophet, declares that these men’s services were no more acceptable to him than <span class="ital">murder, idolatry, </span>or the most <span class="ital">horrid profanation of his name. Yea, they have chosen their own ways </span>— They live as they list; they persist in their wicked practices, and yet expect to recommend themselves to my favour by their ceremonial observances. <span class="ital">And their soul delighteth in their abominations </span>— Taking pleasure in their sins, and showing their contempt of my authority and enmity to my holiness, as much as their fathers did when they were mad upon their idols.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/66.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>66:1-4 The Jews gloried much in their temple. But what satisfaction can the Eternal Mind take in a house made with men's hands? God has a heaven and an earth of his own making, and temples of man's making; but he overlooks them, that he may look with favour to him who is poor in spirit and serious, self-abasing and self-denying; whose heart truly sorrows for sin: such a heart is a living temple for God. The sacrifice of the wicked is not only unacceptable, but a great offence to God. And he that now offers a sacrifice after the law, does in effect set aside Christ's sacrifice. He that burns incense, puts contempt upon the incense of Christ's intercession, and is as if he blessed an idol. Men shall be deceived by the vain confidences with which they deceive themselves. Unbelieving hearts, and unpurified consciences, need no more to make them miserable, than to have their own fears brought upon them. Whatever men put in the place of the priesthood, atonement, and intercession of Christ, will be found hateful to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/66.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man - Lowth and Noyes render this, 'He that slayeth an ox, killeth a man.' This is a literal translation of the Hebrew. Jerome renders it, 'He who sacrifices an ox is as if (quasi) he slew a man.' The Septuagint, in a very free translation - such as is common in their version of Isaiah - render it, 'The wicked man who sacrifices a calf, is as he who kills a dog; and he who offers to me fine flour, it is as the blood of swine.' Lowth supposes the sense to be, that the most flagitious crimes were united with hypocrisy, and that they who were guilty of the most extreme acts of wickedness at the same time affected great strictness in the performance of all the external duties of religion. An instance of this, he says, is referred to by Ezekiel, where he says, 'When they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it' <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-39.htm">Ezekiel 23:39</a>.<p>There can be no doubt that such offences were often committed by those who were very strict and zealous in their religious services (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-14</a>, with <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-21.htm">Isaiah 66:21-23</a>. But the generality of interpreters have supposed that a different sense was to be affixed to this passage. According to their views, the particles as if are to be supplied; and the sense is, not that the mere killing of an ox is as sinful in the sight of God as deliberate murder, but that he who did it in the circumstances, and with the spirit referred to, evinced a spirit as odious in his sight as though he had slain a man. So the Septuagint, Vulgate, Chaldee, Symmachus, and Theodotion, Junius, and Tremellius, Grotius, and Rosenmuller, understand it. There is probably an allusion to the fact that human victims were offered by the pagan; and the sense is, that the sacrifices here referred to were no more acceptable in the sight of God than they were.<p>The prophet here refers, probably, first, to the spirit with which this was done. Their sacrifices were offered with a temper of mind as offensive to God as if a man had been slain, and they had been guilty of murder. They were proud, vain, and hypocritical. 'They had forgotten the true nature and design of sacrifice, and such worship could not but be an abhorrence in the sight of God. Secondly, It may also be implied here, that the period was coming when all sacrifices would be unacceptable to God. When the Messiah should have come; when he should have made by one offering a sufficent atonement for the sins of the whole world; then all bloody sacrifices would be needless, and would be offensive in the sight of God. The sacrifice of an ox would be no more acceptable than the sacrifice of a man; and all offerings with a view to propitiate the divine favor, or that implied that there was a deficiency in the merit of the one great atoning sacrifice, would be odious to God.<p>He that sacrificeth a lamb - Margin, 'Kid' The Hebrew word (&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;  s'eh) may refer to one of a flock, either of sheep or goats <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-7.htm">Genesis 22:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-32.htm">Genesis 30:32</a>. Where the species is to be distinguished, it is usually specified, as, e. g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-4.htm">Deuteronomy 14:4</a>, &#1499;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1506;&#1494;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;  ves'e&#772;h &#8219;&#305;&#770;zzym s'e&#772;h k&#305;&#770;s'a&#770;b&#305;&#770;ym (one of the sheep and one of the goats). Both were used in sacrifice.<p>As if he cut off a dog's neck - That is, as if he had cut off a dog's neck for sacrifice. To offer a dog in sacrifice would have been abominable in the view of a Jew. Even the price for which he was sold was not permitted to be brought into the house of God for a vow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-18.htm">Deuteronomy 23:18</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-43.htm">1 Samuel 17:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-14.htm">1 Samuel 24:14</a>). The dog was held in veneration by many of the pagan, and was even offered in sacrifice; and it was, doubtless, partly in view of this fact, and especially of the fact that such veneration was shown for it in Egypt, that it was an object of such detestation among the Jews. Thus Juvenal, Sat. xiv. says:<p>Oppida tota canem venerantur, nemo Dianam.<p>'Every city worships the dog; none worship Diana.' Diodorus (B. i.) says, 'Certain animals the Egyptians greatly venerate (&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  sebontai), not only when alive, but when they are dead, as cats, ichneumons, mice, and dogs.' Herodotus says also of the Egyptians, 'In some cities, when a cat dies all the inhabitants cut off their eyebrows; when a dog dies, they shave the whole body and the head.' In Samothracia there was a cave in which dogs were sacrificed to Hecate. Plutarch says, that all the Greeks sacrificed the dog. The fact that dogs were offered in sacrifice by the pagan is abundantly proved by Bochart (Hieroz. i. 2. 56). No kind of sacrifice could have been regarded with higher detestation by a pious Jew. But God here says, that the spirit with which they sacrificed a goat or a lamb was as hateful in his sight as would be the sacrifice of a dog: or that the time would come when, the great sacrifice for sin having been made, and the necessity for all other sacrifice having ceased, the offering of a lamb or a goat for the expiation of sin would be as offensive to him as would be the sacrifice of a dog.<p>He that offereth an oblation - On the word rendered here 'oblation' (&#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492;  mincha&#772;h). See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>.<p>As if he offered swine's blood - The sacrifice of a hog was an abomination in the sight of the Hebrews (see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-4.htm">Isaiah 65:4</a>). Yet here it is said that the offering of the &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492;  mincha&#772;h, in the spirit in which they would do it, was as offensive to God as would be the pouring out of the blood of the swine on the altar, Nothing could more emphatically express the detestation of God for the spirit with which they would make their offerings, or the fact that the time would come when all such modes of worship would be offensive in his sight.<p>He that burneth incense - See the word 'incense' explained in the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>. The margin here is, 'Maketh a memorial of.' Such is the usual meaning of the word used here (&#1494;&#1499;&#1512;  za&#770;kar), meaning to remember, and in Hiphil to cause to remember, or to make a memorial. Such is its meaning here. incense was burned as a memorial or a remembrance-offering; that is, to keep up the remembrance of God on the earth by public worship (see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-6.htm">Isaiah 62:6</a>).<p>As if he blessed an idol - The spirit with which incense would be offered would be as offensive as idolatry. The sentiment in all this is, that the most regular and formal acts of worship where the heart is lacking, may be as offensive to God as the worst forms of crime, or the most gross and debasing idolatry. Such a spirit often characterized the Jewish people, and eminently prevailed at the time when the temple of Herod was nearly completed, and when the Saviour was about to appear. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/66.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

The first part of the verse runs literally thus: “The slaughterer of the ox, a slayer of a man; the sacrificer of the sheep, a breaker of a dog’s neck; the offerer of an oblation,—swine’s blood; the maker of a memorial of incense, one that blesseth vanity (i.e. an idol)”;—four legitimate sacrificial acts being bracketed with four detestable idolatrous rites. The first member of each pair is probably to be taken as subj., the second as pred., of a sentence. But this leaves open a choice between two interpretations. (<span class="ital">a</span>) That the legal sacrificial action is as hateful in the sight of God as the idolatrous rite, so long as it is performed by unspiritual worshippers. (<span class="ital">b</span>) That he who does the first series of actions <span class="ital">does also</span> the second, i.e. combines the service of Jehovah with the most hateful idolatries. It is extremely difficult to decide which is the true sense. The words “as if” in E.V. are of course supplied by the translators, but the rendering is a perfectly fair one. The one fact that favours the second explanation (<span class="ital">b</span>) is that the latter part of the verse speaks of those who “delight in their abominations.” Unless there be a complete break in the middle of the verse, which is unlikely, this would seem to imply that the abominations enumerated were actually practised by certain persons, who at the same time claimed to be worshippers of Jehovah.

The Hebr. verb (<span class="ital">hizkîr</span>) is connected with <span class="ital">’azkârâh</span>, the technical name of the part of the meal offering which had to be burned with incense on the altar (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-2.htm" title="And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take out of there his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it on the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD:">Leviticus 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-7.htm" title="And you shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire to the LORD.">Leviticus 24:7</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">blesseth</span> <span class="bld"><span class="ital">an</span> idol<span class="bld"></span></span>] Lit. “vanity,” but the rendering rightly expresses the sense; cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-29.htm" title="Behold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing: their molten images are wind and confusion.">Isaiah 41:29</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Yea, they have chosen &c.</span>] These clauses form the protasis to (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-4.htm" title="I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears on them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke, they did not hear: but they did evil before my eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.">Isaiah 66:4</a></span>.

Sacrifice, without the true spirit of sacrifice, is an abomination (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>, "To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the Lord," etc.). There, however, the sacrifices are actually offered; here they are hypothetical. The ungodly exiles design to offer sacrifice to God in his temple, when they have rebuilt it (ver. 1). God rejects their offerings by anticipation. <span class="cmt_word">As if he out off a dog's neck</span>; <span class="accented">i.e."</span> would no more please me by the sacrifice than if he were to make an offering of the unclean dog." (On the uncleanness of the dog, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-18.htm">Deuteronomy 23:18</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">He that offereth an oblation</span>; or, a meat <span class="accented">offering</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He that burneth incense</span>. With his meat offering, as directed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1, 2</a>. Such a one is no better than he that blesseth (i.e. worships) an idol. It may be suspected that the ritual acts selected for comparison with those of the Levitical law are practices to which the exiles were given (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-3.htm">Isaiah 65:3, 4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Yea, they have chosen</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">as they haw chosen.</span> The clause stands over against the first clause of ver. 4, "As they (<span class="accented">gain hemmah</span>) have chosen their ways, so I (<span class="accented">gain ani</span>) have chosen their delusions." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/65.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the place of the threatened curses of the law in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a> (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>), the very opposite will now receive their fullest realization. "And they will build houses and inhabit them, and plant vineyards and enjoy the fruit thereof. They will not build and another inhabit, nor plant and another enjoy; for like the days of trees are the days of my people, ad my chosen ones will consume the work of their hands. They will not weary themselves in vain, nor bring forth for sudden disaster; for they are a family of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring are left to them." They themselves will enjoy what they have worked for, without some one else stepping in, whether a countryman by violence or inheritance, or a foreigner by plunder or conquest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-8.htm">Isaiah 62:8</a>), to take possession of that which they have built and planted (read &#1497;&#1496;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; without dagesh); for the duration of their life will be as great as that of trees (i.e., of oaks, terebinths, and cedars, which live for centuries), and thus they will be able thoroughly to enjoy in their own person what their hands have made. Billa&#770;h does not mean merely to use and enjoy, but to use up and consume. Work and generation will be blessed then, and there will be no more disappointed hopes. They will not weary themselves (&#1497;&#1490;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; with a preformative &#1497; without that of the root) for failure, not get children labbeha&#770;la&#770;h, i.e., for some calamity to fall suddenly upon them and carry them away (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a>, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-33.htm">Psalm 78:33</a>). The primary idea of ba&#770;hal is either acting, permitting, or bearing, with the characteristic of being let loose, of suddenness, of overthrow, or of throwing into confusion. The lxx renders it &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, probably according to the Egypto-Jewish usage, in which beha&#770;la&#770;h may have signified cursing, like bahle, buhle in the Arabic (see the Appendices). The two clauses of the explanation which follows stand in a reciprocal relation to the two clauses of the previous promise. They are a family of the blessed of God, upon whose labour the blessing of God rests, and their offspring are with them, without being lost to them by premature death. This is the true meaning, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-8.htm">Job 21:8</a>, and not "their offspring with them," i.e., in like manner, as Hitzig supposes. </body></html>
