They prepared a table for that troop of deities which the heathen worship, and poured out drink-offerings to that countless number. Their worshippers spared no cost to honour them, which should shame the worshippers of the true God. See the malignity of sin; it is doing by choice what we know will displease God. In every age and nation, the Lord leaves those who persist in doing evil, and despise the call of the gospel. God's servants shall have the bread of life, and shall want nothing good for them. But those who forsake the Lord, shall be ashamed of vain confidence in their own righteousness, and the hopes they built thereon. Wordly people bless themselves in the abundance of this world's goods; but God's servants bless themselves in him. He is their strength and portion. They shall honour him as the God of truth.

The word rendered here 'curse' (&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1506;&#1492;  shebu&#770;&#8219;a&#770;h) means properly "an oath," or "a swearing"; and then "an imprecation" or "a curse" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-21.htm">Numbers 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-11.htm">Daniel 9:11</a>). The sense here seems to be, that their punishment would be so great that it would become the subject of imprecation when others wished to bind themselves in the most solemn manner by an oath. The pious, who wished to confirm a promise or a covenant in the most solemn manner, would say, 'If we do not perform the promise, then let us experience the same punishment at the hand of God which they have done' (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-22.htm">Jeremiah 29:22</a>). Or it may mean, that their name would be used proverbially, like that of Sodom, as a signal example of wickedness and of the abhorrence of God.<p>And call his servants by another name - So disgraceful and dishonorable shall be that name, that Yahweh will apply another name to his people. Is there not an allusion here to the designed change of the name by which the people of God are known? Has it not been by the special providence of God that his true people are now known by another appellation? Is there any name on earth now that is more the subject of reproach and execration than all the appellations by which his ancient people were known? The name Jew - what ideas does it convey to all the nations of the earth? It is connected with reproach; a name regarded as belonging to a people accursed by God; a name more universally detested than any other known among people. And was it not because this name would be thus dishonored, reproached, and despised, that another was given to the true people of God - the name CHRISTIAN - an honored name - denoting true attachment to the Messiah? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/65.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. curse&#8212;The name of "Jew" has been for long a formula of execration (compare Jer 29:22); if one wishes to curse another, he can utter nothing worse than this, "God make thee what the Jew is!"

Isaiah here speaks of God, whereas in the preceding sentences God Himself spake.

It is objected (1) that the formula would be incomplete, the essential words—“like so-and-so”—being omitted; (2) the “and” is unaccounted for, while to remove it would leave a perf. with a precative sense, a usage which is very doubtful in Hebr. (Driver, <span class="ital">Tenses</span>, § 20). On the other hand, the use of 2nd pers. sing. rather favours the view that the words are meant as a specimen of the curse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and call his servants by another name</span>] The LXX. (Cod. Vat.), with slight modifications of the text, reads: “And on my servants shall be called a new name” (<span class="greekheb">τοῖς δὲ δουλεύουσί μοι κληθήσεται ὄνομα καινόν</span>). The <span class="greekheb">καινόν</span> is no doubt a slip; but the change of “his” to “my” is an obvious improvement, and may safely be adopted. The promise must not be taken too literally, nor too closely connected with the preceding threat. It is hardly conceivable that the prophet contemplates the abrogation of the name “Israel,” because it has been degraded by unworthy Israelites (Cheyne, <span class="ital">Comm.</span>). This would be implied only if the name “Israel” were that which is to remain for a curse, which is again a too violent interpretation. The “other name” is contrasted, not with that which both parties had borne in common, but with names such as “Forsaken,” which describe the present condition of the true believers. Cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-2.htm" title="And the Gentiles shall see your righteousness, and all kings your glory: and you shall be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall name.">Isaiah 62:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-4.htm" title="You shall no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall your land any more be termed Desolate: but you shall be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah: for the LORD delights in you, and your land shall be married.">Isaiah 62:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-12.htm" title="And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD: and you shall be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.">Isaiah 62:12</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/65.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall leave your name for a</span> <span class="cmt_word">curse</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-22.htm">Jeremiah 29:22</a>). In their formulas of imprecation the Jews were in the habit of saying, "The Lord make thee like" this or that person, or this or that class of persons.

"Thus saith Jehovah, As when the must is found in the cluster, men say, Do not destroy it, for there is a blessing within it, so will I do for the sake of my servants, that I may not destroy the whole. And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and an heir of my mountains out of Judah, and my chosen ones shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there." Of the two co-ordinate clauses of the protasis (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-8.htm">Isaiah 65:8</a>), the first contains the necessary condition of the second. Hatt&#305;&#772;ro&#772;sh (must, or the juice of the grapes, from ya&#770;rash, possibly primarily nothing more than receipt, or the produce of labour) and ba&#770;'eshko&#772;l have both of them the article generally found in comparisons (Ges. 109, Anm. 1); &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; signifies, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>, "men say," with the most general and indefinite subject. As men to not destroy a juicy cluster of grapes, because they would thereby destroy the blessing of God which it contains; so will Jehovah for His servants' sake not utterly destroy Israel, but preserve those who are the clusters in the vineyard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>) or upon the vine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-9.htm">Psalm 80:9</a>.) of Israel. He will not destroy hakko&#772;l, the whole without exception; that is to say, keeping to the figure, not "the juice with the skin and stalk," as Knobel and Hahn explain it, but "the particular clusters in which juice is contained, along with the degenerate neglected vineyard or vine, which bears for the most part only sour grapes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a>) or tendrils without fruit (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-5.htm">Isaiah 18:5</a>). The servants of Jehovah, who resemble these clusters, remain preserved. Jehovah brings out, causes to go forth, calls to the light of day (&#1492;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;) as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-16.htm">Isaiah 54:16</a>; here, however, it is by means of sifting: <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-34.htm">Ezekiel 20:34</a>.), out of Jacob and Judah, i.e., the people of the two captivities (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-3.htm">Isaiah 56:3</a>), a seed, a family, that takes possession of His mountains, i.e., His holy mountain-land (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-25.htm">Isaiah 14:25</a>, cf., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1</a>, and har qodsh&#305;&#772;, which is used in the same sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>). As "my mountain" is equivalent in sense to the "land of Israel," for which Ezekiel is fond of saying "the mountains of Israel" (e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2-3</a>), the promise proceeds still further to say, "and my chosen ones will take possession thereof" (viz., of the land, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-21.htm">Isaiah 8:21</a>). </body></html>
