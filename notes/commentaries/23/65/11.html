The words <span class="ital">gad </span>and <span class="ital">meni, </span>the former of which is rendered <span class="ital">troop </span>here, and the latter <span class="ital">number, </span>are thought by many commentators to be the names of certain idols.

The idolatrous Jews erected altars to this fancied goddess on the tops of their houses, or near their doors, and in the corners of their streets, or in groves, and offered to her incense, cakes baked with oil and honey, and drink-offerings of wine, and other liquors. And it appears to have been usual among the Greeks from the most ancient times, to spread in the evening a table covered with dainties, in the highways, in honour to her. But it is of no consequence to us what these objects of idolatrous worship were; nor have we any cause to regret, that the inspired penmen have not deigned to inform us, but have “chosen rather that the memory of the knowledge of them should be utterly abolished. And God be praised, that they are so totally abolished that we are quite at a loss to know what, and what sort of things they were.” — Schmidius, quoted by Bishop Lowth.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/65.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>65:11-16 Here the different states of the godly and wicked, of the Jews who believed, and of those who persisted in unbelief, are set against one another. They prepared a table for that troop of deities which the heathen worship, and poured out drink-offerings to that countless number. Their worshippers spared no cost to honour them, which should shame the worshippers of the true God. See the malignity of sin; it is doing by choice what we know will displease God. In every age and nation, the Lord leaves those who persist in doing evil, and despise the call of the gospel. God's servants shall have the bread of life, and shall want nothing good for them. But those who forsake the Lord, shall be ashamed of vain confidence in their own righteousness, and the hopes they built thereon. Wordly people bless themselves in the abundance of this world's goods; but God's servants bless themselves in him. He is their strength and portion. They shall honour him as the God of truth.

The design of this verse is to remind them of their idolatries, and to assure them that they should not escape unpunished.<p>That forget my holy mountain - Mount Moriah, the sacred mountain on which the temple was built.<p>That prepare a table - It was usual to set food and drink before idols - with the belief that the gods consumed what was thus placed before them (see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-4.htm">Isaiah 65:4</a>). The meaning here is, that the Jews had united with the pagan in thus 'preparing a table;' that is, setting it before the idols referred to, and placing food on it for them.<p>For that troop - Margin, 'Gad.' Perhaps there is nowhere a more unhappy translation than this. It has been made evidently because our translators were not aware of the true meaning of the word, and did not seem to understand that it referred to idolatry. The translation seems to have been adopted with some reference to the paronomasia occurring in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-19.htm">Genesis 49:19</a>; 'Gad, a troop shall overcome him' - &#1497;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; &#1490;&#1491;  ga&#770;d gedu&#770;d yegu&#770;denu&#770; - where the word Gad has some resemblance to the word rendered troop. The word Gad itself, however, never means troop, and evidently should not be so rendered here. Much has been written on this place, and the views of the learned concerning Gad and Meni are very various and uncertain. Those who are disposed to examine the subject at length, may consult Rosenmuller, Vitringa, and Gesenius on the passage; and also the following works.<p>On this passage the reader may consult the Dissertation el David Mills, De Gad et Meni, and also the Dissertation of Jo. Goth. Lakemacher, De Gad et Meni, both of which are to be found in Ugolin's Thesaurus, xxiii. pp. 671-718, where the subject is examined at length. Mills supposes that the names Gad and Meni are two names for the moon - sidus bonum, and &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;  me&#772;ne&#772;. He remarks that 'on account of the power which the moon is supposed to exert over sublunary things, it was often called the goddess Fortune. It is certain that the Egyptians by &#x3a4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;  Tuche&#772; (Fortune), which they numbered among the gods who were present at the birth of man, understood the moon.' Among the Arabians and Persians the moon is said to have been denominated Sidus felix et faustum - 'The happy and propitious star.' See Rosenmuller in loc. Lakemather supposes that two idols are meant - Hecate and Mann Vitringa and Rosenmuller suppose that the sun and moon are intended. Grotius supposes that the name Gad means the same as the goddess Fortune, which was worshipped by the Hebrews, Chaldeans, and Arabians; and that Meni means a divinity of that name, which Strabo says was worshipped in Armenia and Phrygia. Other opinions may be seen in Vitringa. That two idols are intended here, there can be no doubt. For,<p>1. The circumstance mentioned of their preparing a table for them, and pouring out a drink-offering, is expressive of idolatry.<p>2. The connection implies this, as the reproof in this chapter is to a considerable extent for their idolatry.<p>3. The universal opinion of expositors, though they have varied in regard to the idols intended, proves this.<p>Aben Ezra, Kimchi, and the rabbis generally suppose that by Gad the planet Jupiter was intended, which they say was worshipped throughout the East as the god of fortune, and this is now the prevalent opinion. The word &#1490;&#1491;  gad, says Gesenius, means fortune, especially the god Fortune, which was worshipped in Babylon. He supposes that it was the same idol which was also called Baal or Bel (compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1</a>), and that by this name the planet Jupiter - Stella Jovis - was intended, which was regarded throughout the East as the genius and giver of good fortune, hence called by the Arabians bona fortuna major - 'the greater good fortune.' The word 'Meni,' on the other hand, Gesenius supposes to denote the planet Venus, called in the East bolla fortuna minor - 'the lesser good fortune.' The Vulgate renders this, Fortunae - 'To Fortune.' The Septuagint, &#x3a4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837;  to&#772; daimonio&#772; - 'To a demon;' though, in the corresponding member, Meni is rendered by &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#837;  te&#772; tuche&#772; - 'To Fortune,' and it is possible that the order of the words has been inverted, and that they meant to render the word Gad by Fortune. The Chaldee renders it simply, &#1500;&#1496;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503;  let&#803;a&#8219;eva&#770;n - 'To idols.' It is agreed on all hands that some idol is here referred to that was extensively worshipped in the East; and the general impression is, that it was an idol representing Fortune. But whether it was the Sun, or the planet Jupiter, is not easy to determine.<p>That it was customary to place a table before the idol has been already remarked, and is expressly affirmed by Jerome. 'In all cities,' says he, 'and especially in Egypt, and in Alexandria, it was an ancient custom of idolatry, that on the last day of the year, and of the last month, they placed a table filled with food of various kinds, and a cup containing wine and honey mixed together - poculum mulso mistum - either as an expression of thankfulness for the fertility of the past year, or invoking fertility for the coming year.' Thus Herodotus (iii. 18) also describes the celebrated table of the sun in Ethiopia. 'What they call the table of the sun was this: A plain in the vicinity of the city was filled, to the height of four feet, with roasted flesh of all kinds of animals, which was carried there in the night under the inspection of magistrates; during the day, whoever pleased was at liberty to go and satisfy his hunger. The natives of the place affirm that the earth spontaneously produces all these viands; this, however, is what they call the table of the sun.'<p>And that furnish the drink-offering - In all ancient worship, it was customary to pour out a libation, or a drink-offering. This was done among idolaters, to complete the idea of a repast. As they placed food before the idols, so they also poured out wine before them, with the idea of propitiating them (see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-6.htm">Isaiah 57:6</a>).<p>To that number - Margin, 'Meni.' The phrase, 'to that number' evidently conveys no idea, and it would have been much better to have retained the name Meni, without any attempt to translate it. The rendering, 'to that number' was adopted because the word &#1502;&#1504;&#1497;  men&#305;&#770;y is derived from &#1502;&#1504;&#1492;  ma&#770;na&#770;h, to allot, to appoint, to number. Various opinions also have been entertained in regard to this. Rosenmuller and many others suppose that the moon is intended, and it has been supposed that the name Meni was given to that luminary because it numbered the months, or divided the time. Bynaeus and David Mills have endeavored to demonstrate that this was the moon, and that this was extensively worshipped in Eastern nations. Vitringa supposes that it was the same deity which was worshipped by the Syrians and Philistines by the name of Astarte, or Ashtaroth, as it is called in the Scripture; or as &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  ouranie&#772;s, the queen of heaven; and if the name Gad be supposed to represent the sun, the name Meni will doubtless represent the moon.<p>The goddess Ashtaroth or Astarte, was a goddess of the Sidonians, and was much worshipped in Syria and Phenicia. Solomon introduced her worship in Jerusalem <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-33.htm">1 Kings 11:33</a>. Three hundred priests were constantly employed in her service at Hierapolis in Syria. She was called 'the queen of heaven;' and is usually mentioned in connection with Baal. Gesenius supposes that the planet Venus is intended, regarded as the source of good fortune, and worshipped extensively in connection with the planet Jupiter, especially in the regions of Babylonia. It seems to be agreed that the word refers to the worship of either the moon or the planet Venus, regarded as the goddess of good fortune. It is not very material which is intended, nor is it easy to determine. The works referred to above may be consulted for a more full examination of the subject than is consistent with the design of these notes. The leading idea of the prophet is, that they were deeply sunken and debased in thus forsaking Yahweh, and endeavoring to propitiate the favor of idol-gods. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/65.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. holy mountain&#8212;Moriah, on which the temple was.<p>troop&#8212;rather "Gad," the Babylonian god of fortune, the planet Jupiter, answering to Baal or Bel; the Arabs called it "the Greater Good Fortune"; and the planet Venus answering to Meni, "the Lesser Good Fortune" [Gesenius, Kimchi, &c.].

The Vulgate Latin version renders it, "for fortune": and the word is used by the Jewish writers (y) for the goddess Fortune, or good luck, and who make mention of "the bed of fortune" (z); a bed, which, they say, is prepared for a star, and no man may sleep on it; and a table also, which they might not use but for that star, the same with the table here; for they used beds or couches at their tables, or at eating. And Jerom on the place says, it was an old custom in Egypt, particularly in Alexandria and other cities, on the last day of the year, to prepares table, with all kind of provisions for eating and drinking, by way of thankfulness for the fertility of the last year, and in order to obtain it in the year following; and this the Israelites did. "Table" seems to be put for an altar, on which sacrifice was offered to idols.

Moses takes to be the name of a star; some interpret it of a number of stars or planets, the seven planets particularly; and others of the planet Mercury. Some think it is the name of an idol, either, of an idol of the Arabians, as Pocock (b); or of the Armenians, as others, Armenia being called Minni, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27</a>. The Targum interprets both clauses of idol deities; and so, in the gloss on the Talmud (c), they are both said to be the names of idols. Bynaeus (d) seems to me to have advanced the best notion of Gad and Meni, translated "that troop", and "that number", which is, that the one signifies the sun, and the other the moon, which he supports with many reasons; so Vitringa; and yet there is a difficulty in the words, how they are to be applied to the Jews in the times of Christ and the apostles, when they were not guilty of such idolatrous practices; unless this is to be understood of the sins of their forefathers visited on them, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-3.htm">Isaiah 65:3</a>, though this is said of the same persons that forsook the Lord, and forgot his mountain; wherefore I am inclined to think that some thing like this is the sense of the words; that the evil charged upon this people, and of which they were guilty, was, that they regarded the stars, and attributed their case and circumstances to the influences of them, or to fate and fortune, rather than to the providence of God; or trusted in their troops and numbers, and so defied and despised the Roman army that besieged them, which was their ruin. <p>(y) Bereshit Rabba, sect. 65. fol. 58. 2.

The second view implies residence in Palestine at a time when the Temple services were in full operation; hence the other is necessarily adopted by all who hold the prophecy to have been written in Babylon. It is perhaps impossible to decide which is right, although those who recognise a Palestinian colouring throughout the chapter will naturally prefer the second as the more forcible interpretation, and find in it some confirmation of their theory.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that prepare a table &c.</span>] Better: <span class="bld">that spread a table for Gad, and fill up mixed wine</span> (see ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-22.htm" title="Woe to them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:">Isaiah 5:22</a>) <span class="bld">to Meni</span>. The rites described are the <span class="ital">lectisternia</span>, well known throughout the ancient world, in which a table was spread, furnished with meats and drinks as a meal for the gods (Liv. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-13.htm" title="Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.">Isaiah 5:13</a>; Herodot. 1:183; Ep. of Jeremiah , vv. 27 f.; Bel and the Dragon, <span class="ital">v.</span> 11; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-18.htm" title="The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.">Jeremiah 7:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-13.htm" title="And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings to other gods.">Jeremiah 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-17.htm" title="But we will certainly do whatever thing goes forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.">Jeremiah 44:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-21.htm" title="You cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: you cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.">1 Corinthians 10:21</a>). A parallel in the O.T. religion is the Shewbread in the Temple (or Tabernacle), <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-30.htm" title="And you shall set on the table show bread before me always.">Exodus 25:30</a> &c. Gesenius remarks that the description of the complete <span class="ital">lectisternium</span> extends over both members of the parallelism, and infers that the two deities were worshipped together. This is probable, being in accordance with ancient custom (Liv. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-13.htm" title="Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.">Isaiah 5:13</a>), but the laws of Hebrew parallelism hardly permit us to say that this must be the meaning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That Gad and Meni are divine proper names is universally acknowledged, although neither has quite lost its appellative signification and both are here pointed with the article. Gad means “good fortune”; he is personified luck. [The rendering “troop” in A.V. is a mistake. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-11.htm" title="And Leah said, A troop comes: and she called his name Gad.">Genesis 30:11</a>, where “A troop cometh” should be “With fortune!” as R.V. marg. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-19.htm" title="Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.">Genesis 49:19</a>, where a different etymology is supposed, the word for “troop” is not <span class="ital">gad</span> but <span class="ital">gĕdûd</span>.] The existence of a Syrian god of this name (or the Greek equivalent <span class="greekheb">Τύχη</span>) is well established, and his worship is proved to have extended over a very wide area (see Baethgen, <span class="ital">Beiträge zur Sem. Rel.-Gesch.</span> pp. 76–80). It appears that the evidence is most copious amongst the Greek inscriptions of the Hauran (note the proximity to the Hebrew tribe of Gad) where there must have been numerous temples in his honour. But the name occurs also in Phœnician and Palmyrene inscriptions, and on coins of several cities, including Ashkelon, while a temple to the “Fortune” of Gaza is known to have existed in that city (Baethgen, p. 66). The place-names Baal-Gad (at the foot of Hermon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-17.htm" title="Even from the mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.">Joshua 11:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-7.htm" title="And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon even to the mount Halak, that goes up to Seir; which Joshua gave to the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions;">Joshua 12:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-5.htm" title="And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sun rise, from Baalgad under mount Hermon to the entering into Hamath.">Joshua 13:5</a>) and Migdal-Gad (in Judah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-37.htm" title="Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdalgad,">Joshua 15:37</a>) seem to shew that his worship was practised in Palestine proper. There are besides frequent references in Syriac and later Jewish literature; a Syriac writer of the 5th century mentions that <span class="ital">lectisternia</span> were still prepared for Gad in his time. The Jewish interpreters identified Gad with the planet Jupiter, called by the Arabs “the greater Luck,” but this association may be more recent than our passage (Baethgen). Meni (<span class="ital">Měnî</span>) has left fewer traces. He is possibly identical with the goddess <span class="ital">Manât</span>, one of the three chief divinities of the pre-Mohammedan Arabs (Koran, Sura 53:19–23). A personal name <span class="ital">‘Abdmenî</span> (= Servant of Meni?) has been found on coins of the Achæmenidæ, but the accuracy of this is doubted by some (Delitzsch, Schrader in Riehm’s <span class="ital">Handwörterbuch</span>). The meaning of the word is “Destiny,” and the god has been identified with the planet Venus, “the lesser Luck” of the Arabs. It is quite as likely, however, that Meni is the antithesis of Gad,—the god of <span class="ital">evil</span> destiny. [Observe that in the LXX. Gad is <span class="greekheb">Δαιμόνιον</span> and Meni <span class="greekheb">Τύχη</span>.] Nothing has yet been discovered to connect these deities with the Babylonian pantheon. Some think they may be Hebrew equivalents of Babylonian names (Dillmann), others that their worship was transported from Syria to Babylon (Baethgen). These are speculations, but the actual evidence points to Western Asia as the natural environment of this cult.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/65.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-16.</span> - A MIXTURE OF THREATS WITH PROMISES. The prophet returns, in the main, to his former attitude, and resumes his denunciations (vers. 11, 12); but, with ver. 13, he begins to intermingle promises of favour to God's servants with threats against the rebellious, and finally (in ver. 16) turns wholly towards the side of grace and favour, announcing the coming of a time when "the former troubles" will be altogether "forgotten," and the kingdom of truth and right will be established. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But ye are they that forsake the Lord</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but as for you who forsake the</span>  <span class="accented">Lord. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And forget my holy mountain</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either, literally, <span class="accented">forget</span> Zion. being absent from it so long (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-5.htm">Psalm 137:5</a>), or, possibly, <span class="accented">neglect</span> Zion, though you might worship there if you pleased. <span class="cmt_word">That prepare a table for that troop</span>; rather, <span class="accented">that prepare a table for Gad.</span> There is ground for believing that "Gad" was a Phoenician deity, perhaps "the god of good fortune" (Cheyne), though this is not clearly ascertained; sometimes worshipped as an aspect of Baal, whence the name, Baal-Gad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-17.htm">Joshua 11:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-7.htm">Joshua 12:7</a>); sometimes connected with other deities, as Moloch and Ashtoreth. The practice of "preparing tables" for the heathen gods was a common one, and appears in Herod., 1:181; in Baruch 6:30; in Bel and the Dragon, ver. 11; and in the Roman <span class="accented">lectisternia.</span> The tables prepared for the dead in Egyptian tombs were not very different, and implied a qualified worship of ancestors (Rawlinson, 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. pp. 423, 424; vol. 2 p. 39). And that furnish the drink offering unto that number; rather, <span class="accented">and that fill up mixed drink for M'ni.</span> M'ni appears, like Gad, to have been a Syrian deity, the name Ebed-M'ni, "servant of M'ni," occurring on Aramaeo-Persian coins of the Achaemenian period (Rodiger, in 'Addenda to Gesenius' Thesaurus,' p. 97). The word may be suspected to be cognate to the Arabic "Manat," a god recognized in the Koran as a mediator with Allah; but can scarcely have any connection with the Aryan names for the moon deity, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, <span class="accented">Mena</span>, and the like.

"The people that continually provoketh me by defying me to my face, sacrificing in the gardens, and burning incense upon the tiles; who sit in the graves, and spend the night in closed places; to eat the flesh of swine, and broken pieces of abominations is in their dishes; who say, Stop! come not too near me; for I am holy to thee: they are a smoke in my nose, a fire blazing continually." &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; (these) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-5.htm">Isaiah 65:5</a> is retrospective, summing up the subject as described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-3.htm">Isaiah 65:3-5</a>, and what follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-5.htm">Isaiah 65:5</a> contains the predicate. The heathenish practices of the exiles are here depicted, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-7.htm">Isaiah 65:7</a> they are expressly distinguished from those of their fathers. Hence there is something so peculiar in the description, that we look in vain for parallels among those connected with the idolatry of the Israelites before the time of the captivity. There is only one point of resemblance, viz., the allusion to gardens as places of worship, which only occurs in the book of Isaiah, and in which our passage, together with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-5.htm">Isaiah 57:5</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-17.htm">Isaiah 66:17</a>, strikingly coincides with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-29.htm">Isaiah 1:29</a>. "Upon my face" (&#8219;al-pa&#770;nai) is equivalent to "freely and openly, without being ashamed of me, or fearing me;" cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-11.htm">Job 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-28.htm">Job 6:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-31.htm">Job 21:31</a>. "Burning incense upon the bricks" carries us to Babylonia, the true home of the cocti lateres (laterculi). The thorah only mentions lebhe&#772;n&#305;&#772;m in connection with Babylonian and Egyptian buildings. The only altars that it allows are altars of earth thrown up, or of unhewn stones and wooden beams with a brazen covering. "They who sit in the graves," according to Vitringa, are they who sacrifice to the dead. He refers to the Greek and Roman inferiae and februationes, or expiations for the dead, as probably originating in the East. Sacrifices for the dead were offered, in fact, not only in India and Persia, but also in Hither Asia among the Ssabians, and therefore probably in ancient Mesopotamia and Babylonia. But were they offered in the graves themselves, as we must assume from &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (not &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1511;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;)? Nothing at all is known of this, and Bttcher (de inferis, 234) is correct in rendering it "among (inter) the graves," and supposing the object to be to hold intercourse there with the dead and with demons. The next point, viz., passing the night in closed places (i.e., places not accessible to every one: netsu&#772;r&#305;&#772;m, custodita  equals  clausa, like ne&#8219;&#305;&#772;m&#305;&#772;m, amaena), may refer to the mysteries celebrated in natural caves and artificial crypts (on the mysteries of the Ssabians, see Chwolsohn, Die Ssabier u. der Ssabismus, ii. 332ff.). But the lxx and Syriac render it &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;  &#787;&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, evidently understanding it to refer to the so-called incubare, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;; and so Jerome explains it. "In the temples of idols," he says, "where they were accustomed to lie upon the skins of the victims stretched upon the ground, to gather future events from their dreams." The expression ubhannetsu&#772;r&#305;&#772;m points not so much to open temples, as to inaccessible caves or subterraneous places. G. Rawlinson (Monarchies, ii. 269) mentions the discovery of "clay idols in holes below the pavement of palaces." From the next charge, "who eat there the flesh of the swine," we may infer that the Babylonians offered swine in sacrifice, if not as a common thing, yet like the Egyptians and other heathen, and ate their flesh ("the flesh taken from the sacrifice," 2 Macc. 6:21); whereas among the later Ssabians (Harranians) the swine was not regarded as either edible or fit for sacrifice. <p>On the synecdochical character of the sentence &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;&#1511;, see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-2.htm">Jeremiah 24:2</a>. Knobel's explanation, "pieces" (but it is not &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;&#1511;&#1497;) "of abominations are their vessels, i.e., those of their &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;," is a needless innovation. &#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; signifies a stench, putrefaction (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-14.htm">Ezekiel 4:14</a>, besar piggu&#772;l), then in a concrete sense anything corrupt or inedible, a thing to be abhorred according to the laws of food or the law generally (syn. &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;); and when connected with &#1508;&#1512;&#1511; (chethib), which bears the same relation to &#1502;&#1512;&#1511; as crumbs or pieces (from &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511;, to crumble) to broth (from &#1502;&#1514;&#1511;, to rub off or scald off), it means a decoction, or broth made either of such kinds of flesh or such parts of the body as were forbidden by the law. The context also points to such heathen sacrifices and sacrificial meals as were altogether at variance with the Mosaic law. For the five following words proceed from the mouths of persons who fancy that they have derived a high degree of sanctity either from the mysteries, or from their participation in rites of peculiar sacredness, so that to every one who abstains from such rites, or does not enter so deeply into them as they do themselves, they call out their "odi profanum vulgus et arceo." &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;, keep near to thyself, i.e., stay where you are, like the Arabic idhab ileika, go away to thyself, for take thyself off. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497; (according to some MSS with mercha tifchah), do not push against me (equivalent to &#1490;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1470;&#1492;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492; or &#1490;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1498;, get away, make room; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-9.htm">Genesis 19:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-20.htm">Isaiah 49:20</a>), for qedashtikha&#770;, I am holy to thee, i.e., unapproachable. The verbal suffix is used for the dative, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-21.htm">Isaiah 44:21</a> (Ges. 121, 4), for it never occurred to any of the Jewish expositors (all of whom give sanctus prae te as a gloss) that the kal qa&#770;dash was used in a transitive sense, like cha&#770;zaq in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7</a>, as Luther, Calvin, and even Hitzig suppose. Nor is the exclamation the well-meant warning against the communication of a burdensome qedussha&#770;h, which had to be removed by washing before a man could proceed to the duties of every-day life (such, for example, as the qedussha&#770;h of the man who had touched the flesh of a sin-offering, or bee sprinkled with the blood of a sin-offering; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-20.htm">Leviticus 6:20</a>, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-19.htm">Ezekiel 44:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-20.htm">Ezekiel 46:20</a>). It is rather a proud demand to respect the sacro-sanctus, and not to draw down the chastisement of the gods by the want of reverential awe. After this elaborate picture, the men who are so degenerate receive their fitting predicate. They are fuel for the wrath of God, which manifests itself, as it were, in smoking breath. This does not now need for the first time to seize upon them; but they are already in the midst of the fire of wrath, and are burning there in inextinguishable flame. </body></html>
