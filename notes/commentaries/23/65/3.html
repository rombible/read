Often he meets some thoughtless trifler or profligate opposer, and says to him, Behold me; and a speedy change takes place. All the gospel day, Christ waited to be gracious. The Jews were bidden, but would not come. It is not without cause they are rejected of God. They would do what most pleased them. They grieved, they vexed the Holy Spirit. They forsook God's temple, and sacrificed in groves. They cared not for the distinction between clean and unclean meats, before it was taken away by the gospel. Perhaps this is put for all forbidden pleasures, and all that is thought to be gotten by sin, that abominable thing which the Lord hates. Christ denounced many woes against the pride and hypocrisy of the Jews. The proof against them is plain. And let us watch against pride and self-preference, remembering that every sin, and the most secret thoughts of man's heart, are known and will be judged by God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/65.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A people - This verse contains a specification of the reasons why God had rejected them, and brought the calamities upon them.<p>That provoketh me to anger - That is, by their sins.

The Hebrew is simply, 'Upon bricks.' The command of God was that the altars for sacrifice should be made of unhewn stone <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24-25</a>. But the pagan had altars of a different description, and the Jews had sacrificed on those altars. Some have supposed that this means that they sacrificed on the roofs of their houses, which were flat, and paved with brick, or tile, or plaster. That altars were constructed sometimes on the roofs of their houses, we know from <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12</a>, where Josiah is said to have beaten down the 'altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the king of Judah had made.' But it is not necessary to suppose that such sacrifices are referred to here. They had disobeyed the command of God, which required that the altars should be made only of unhewn stone. They had built other altars, and had joined with the pagan in offering sacrifices thereon. The reason why God forbade that the altar should be of anything but unhewn stone is not certainly known, and is not necessary to be understood in order to explain this passage. It may have been, first, in order effectually to separate his people from all others, as well in the construction of the altar as in anything and everything else; secondly, because various inscriptions and carvings were usually made on altars, and as this tended to superstition, God commanded that the chisel should not be used at all in the construction of the altars where his people should worship. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/65.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. continually&#8212;answering to "all the day" (Isa 65:2). God was continually inviting them, and they continually offending Him (De 32:21).<p>to my face&#8212;They made no attempt to hide their sin (Isa 3:9).

This was in order to separate them, even in external respects, from idolaters; also, as all chiselling was forbidden, they could not inscribe superstitious symbols on them as the heathen did. Bricks were more easily so inscribed than stone; hence their use for the cuneiform inscriptions at Babylon, and also for idolatrous altars. Some, not so well, have supposed that the "bricks" here mean the flat brick-paved roofs of houses on which they sacrificed to the sun, &c.

They committed their sins openly, without any fear of the divine Being, and in defiance of him, not at all awed by his omniscience and omnipresence; they committed them in the open streets, and even in the temple, the place of the divine residence; and these they did constantly, which provoked him to anger and wrath against them; particularly the following sins: <p>that sacrificeth in gardens; to idols, as the Targum, placed there, as they were under every green tree; or in groves, where idols were worshipped. Fortunatus Scacchus (h) thinks this refers to their having their sepulchres in their gardens, where they consulted the dead; which is favoured by a clause in the next verse: <p>and burneth incense on altars of brick: or, "upon bricks" (i).

The groves and "gardens" of Daphne, near Antioch. became famous in later times as the scene of idolatrous practices intimately bound up with the grossest and most shameless sensualism. We have few details of the ancient Syrian rites; but there is reason to believe that, wherever Astarte, the Dea Syra, was worshipped, whether at Daphne, or at Hierapolis, or at Balbek, or at Aphek, or at Damascus, or in Palestine, one and the same character of cult prevailed. The nature-goddess was viewed as best worshipped by rites into which sensualism entered as an essential element. Profligacy that cannot be described polluted the consecrated precincts, which were rendered attractive by all that was beautiful and delightful, whether in art or nature-by groves, gardens, statues, fountains, shrines, temples, music, processions, shows - and which were in consequence frequented both day and night by a multitude of votaries. <span class="cmt_word">And burneth incense upon altars of brick</span>; literally, upon the bricks. It is not clear that "altars" are intended. More probably the incense was burnt upon the tiled or bricked roofs of houses, where the Jews of Jeremiah's time "burned incense unto all the host of heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-29.htm">Jeremiah 32:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>). Brick altars are nowhere mentioned. The Assyrians and Babylonians made their altars of either stone or metal ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 36, 37; Herod., 1. 183). The Hebrews in early times had altars of earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>). The "altar of incense" in the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1-3</a>) was of wood plated with gold; that of burnt offering, of wood plated with bronze (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1, 2</a>). Solomon's altars were similar. Elijah on one occasion made an altar of twelve rough stones (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-31.htm">1 Kings 18:31</a>). The Assyrians used polished stone, as did the Greeks and Romans. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/64.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The re-erection of the ruins of the promised land requires the zeal of every one, and this state of ruin must not continue. It calls out the love and faithfulness of Jehovah. "The cities of Thy holiness have become a pasture-ground; Zion has become a pasture-ground, Jerusalem a desert. The house of our holiness and of our adorning, where our fathers praised Thee, is given up to the fire, and everything that was our delight given up to devastation. Wilt Thou restrain Thyself in spite of this, O Jehovah, be silent, and leave us to suffer the utmost?" Jerusalem by itself could not possibly be called "cities" (&#8219;a&#770;re&#772;), say with reference to the upper and lower cities (Vitringa). It is merely mentioned by name as the most prominent of the many cities which were all "holy cities," inasmuch as the whole of Canaan was the land of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-25.htm">Isaiah 14:25</a>), and His holy territory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-54.htm">Psalm 78:54</a>). The word midba&#770;r (pasture-land, heath, different from tsiyya&#770;h, the pastureless desert, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-1.htm">Isaiah 35:1</a>) is repeated, for the purpose of showing that the same fate had fallen upon Zion-Jerusalem as upon the rest of the cities of the land. The climax of the terrible calamity was the fact, that the temple had also fallen a prey to the burning of the fire (compare for the fact, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-13.htm">Jeremiah 52:13</a>). The people call it "house of our holiness and of our glory." Jehovah's qo&#772;desh and tiph'ereth have, as it were, transplanted heaven to earth in the temple (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-7.htm">Isaiah 60:7</a>); and this earthly dwelling-place of God is Israel's possession, and therefore Israel's qo&#772;desh and tiph'ereth.
