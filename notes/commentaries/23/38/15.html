It is well for us to remember the mercies we receive in sickness. Hezekiah records the condition he was in. He dwells upon this; I shall no more see the Lord. A good man wishes not to live for any other end than that he may serve God, and have communion with him. Our present residence is like that of a shepherd in his hut, a poor, mean, and cold lodging, and with a trust committed to our charge, as the shepherd has. Our days are compared to the weaver's shuttle, Job 7:6, passing and repassing very swiftly, every throw leaving a thread behind it; and when finished, the piece is cut off, taken out of the loom, and showed to our Master to be judged of. A good man, when his life is cut off, his cares and fatigues are cut off with it, and he rests from his labours. But our times are in God's hand; he has appointed what shall be the length of the piece. When sick, we are very apt to calculate our time, but are still at uncertainty. It should be more our care how we shall get safe to another world. And the more we taste of the loving-kindness of God, the more will our hearts love him, and live to him. It was in love to our poor perishing souls that Christ delivered them. The pardon does not make the sin not to have been sin, but not to be punished as it deserves. It is pleasant to think of our recoveries from sickness, when we see them flowing from the pardon of sin. Hezekiah's opportunity to glorify God in this world, he made the business, and pleasure, and end of life. Being recovered, he resolves to abound in praising and serving God. God's promises are not to do away, but to quicken and encourage the use of means. Life and health are given that we may glorify God and do good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What shall I say? - This language seems to denote surprise and gratitude at unexpected deliverance. It is the language of a heart that is overflowing, and that wants words to express its deep emotions. In the previous verse he had described his pain, anguish, and despair. In this he records the sudden and surprising deliverance which God had granted; which was so great that no words could express his sense of it. Nothing could be more natural than this language; nothing would more appropriately express the feelings of a man who had been suddenly restored to health from dangerous sickness, and brought from the borders of the grave.<p>He hath both spoken unto me - That is, he has promised. So the word is often used <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-17.htm">Deuteronomy 26:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-19.htm">Jeremiah 3:19</a>. He had made the promise by the instrumentality of Isaiah Isa 38:5-6. The promise related to his recovery, to the length of his days, and to his entire deliverance from the hands of the Assyrians.<p>And himself hath done it - He himself has restored me according to his promise, when no one else could have done it.<p>I shall go softly - Lowth renders this, in accordance with the Vulgate, 'Will I reflect.' But the Hebrew will not bear this construction. The word used here (&#1491;&#1491;&#1492;  da&#770;da&#770;h) occurs in but one other place in the Bible <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-4.htm">Psalm 42:4</a> : 'I went with them to the house of God;' that is, I went with them in a sacred procession to the house of God; I went with a solemn, calm, slow pace. The idea here is, 'I will go humbly, submissively, all my life; I will walk in a serious manner, remembering that I am traveling to the grave; I will avoid pride, pomp, and display; I will suffer the remembrance of my sickness, and of God's mercy to produce a calm, serious, thoughtful demeanour all my life.' This is the proper effect of sickness on a pious mind, and it is its usual effect. And probably, one design of God was to keep Hezekiah from the ostentatious parade usually attendant on his lofty station; from being elated with his deliverance from the Assyrian; from improper celebrations of that deliverance by revelry and pomp; and to keep him in remembrance, that though he was a monarch, yet he was a mortal man, and that he held his life at the disposal of God.<p>In the bitterness of my soul - I will remember the deep distress, the bitter sorrows of my sickness, and my surprising recovery; and will allow the remembrance of that to diffuse seriousness and gratitude over all my life. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-20. The second part of the song passes from prayer to thanksgiving at the prayer being heard.<p>What shall I say?&#8212;the language of one at a loss for words to express his sense of the unexpected deliverance.<p>both spoken &#8230; and &#8230; done it&#8212;(Nu 23:19). Both promised and performed (1Th 5:24; Heb 10:23).<p>himself&#8212;No one else could have done it (Ps 98:1).<p>go softly &#8230; in the bitterness&#8212;rather, "on account of the bitterness"; I will behave myself humbly in remembrance of my past sorrow and sickness from which I have been delivered by God's mercy (see 1Ki 21:27, 29). In Ps 42:4, the same Hebrew verb expresses the slow and solemn gait of one going up to the house of God; it is found nowhere else, hence Rosenmuller explains it, "I will reverently attend the sacred festivals in the temple"; but this ellipsis would be harsh; rather metaphorically the word is transferred to a calm, solemn, and submissive walk of life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">What shall I say</span> I want words sufficient to express my deep sense of God’s dealings with me. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it; </span> he did foretell it by his word, and effect it by his hand. This clause and verse is either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. A continuance of his complaint hitherto described: God hath passed this sentence upon me, and hath also put it in execution, and to him I must submit myself. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. A transition or entrance into the thanksgiving, which is undoubtedly contained in the following verses. So the sense is, God hath sent a gracious message to me by his prophet, concerning the prolongation of my life; and he, I doubt not, will make good his word therein. And this sense seems the more probable, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Because here is mention of his years to come, whereas in his sickness he expected not to live to the end of a day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Because the Chaldee paraphrast, and the LXX., and Syriac, and Arabic interpreters expound it so in their versions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Because this suits best with the context and coherence of this verse, both with the former and with the following verse. For as he endeth the foregoing verse with a prayer to God for longer life, so in this verse he relates God’s gracious answer to his prayer. And if this verse be thus understood, the next verse hath a very convenient connexion with this; whereas it seems to be very abrupt and incoherent, if the thanksgiving begin there. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I shall go softly; </span> I shall walk in the course of my life, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Humbly, with all humble thankfulness to God for conferring so great a favour upon so unworthy a person; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Easily and peaceably, with leisure, not like one affrighted, or running away from his enemy; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. By slow and gentle paces, as men commonly spin out their days by degrees unto a just length, which is not unfitly opposed to his former state and time of sickness, wherein his <span class="ital">days</span> were <span class="ital">swifter than a weaver’s shuttle</span>, and <span class="ital">than a post</span>, as Job complained upon the same occasion, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-6.htm" title="My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.">Job 7:6</a> 9:25</span>, and were cut off like a weaver’s web, as he complained, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-12.htm" title="My age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night will you make an end of me.">Isaiah 38:12</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the bitterness of my soul; </span> arising from the remembrance of that desperate condition from which God had delivered me; for great dangers, though past, are ofttimes very terrible to those that reflect upon them.

Two extremely difficult verses.

Literally it reads:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“What shall I say? And He said to me—and <span class="ital">He</span> (emphatic) did it;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I shall walk with leisurely pace all my years—because of the bitterness of my soul.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The words <span class="ital">he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done</span> it would refer to the promise of recovery through the prophet, and the fulfilment of it. This whole conception of the verse is vigorously criticised by Duhm, who renders thus:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“What shall I speak and say to Him—since <span class="ital">He</span> has done it?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I toss to and fro all my sleeping time—because of the bitterness of my soul.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Hebr. word rendered “toss to and fro” is found again only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-4.htm" title="When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holy day.">Psalm 42:4</a>, where it means “to walk in festal procession.” Duhm in this passage is disposed to connect it with a noun found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-4.htm" title="When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro to the dawning of the day.">Job 7:4</a> (“tossings to and fro”).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What shall I say?</span> The strain is suddenly changed. Hezekiah's prayer has been answered, and he has received the answer (vers. 5-8). He is "at a loss to express his wonder and his gratitude" (Cheyne); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-20.htm">2 Samuel 7:20</a>. God has both spoken unto him - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, given him a promise of recovery - and also himself hath done <span class="accented">it</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> has performed his promise. Already he feels in himself the beginnings of amendment - he is conscious that the worst is past, and that the malady has taken a turn for the better. <span class="cmt_word">I shall go softly all my years</span>. Delitzsch renders, "I shall walk quietly;" Mr. Cheyne, "I shall walk at ease;" both apparently understanding the expression of a quiet, easy life, made the more pleasant by contrast with past pain. But it seems better to understand the "soft going," with Dr. Kay, of a hushed and subdued spirit, consequent upon the crisis past, and thenceforth continuing - the king walking, as it were, perpetually in God's presence. <span class="cmt_word">In the bitterness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">after the bitterness</span> (Delitzsch), when it has departed; and "because <span class="accented">of</span> it" (Nagelsbach), through its remembrance. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/38.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As a documentary proof of this third account, a psalm of Hezekiah is added in the text of Isaiah, in which he celebrates his miraculous rescue from the brink of death. The author of the book of Kings has omitted it; but the genuineness is undoubted. The heading runs thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-9.htm">Isaiah 38:9</a> : "Writing of Hizkiyahu king of Judah, when he was sick, and recovered from his sickness." The song which follows might be headed Mikhtam, since it has the characteristics of this description of psalm (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-1.htm">Psalm 16:1</a>). We cannot infer from bacha&#774;lo&#772;tho&#772; (when he was sick) that it was composed by Hezekiah during his illness (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-1.htm">Psalm 51:1</a>); vayyechi (and he recovered) stamps it as a song of thanksgiving, composed by him after his recovery. In common with the two Ezrahitish psalms, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/88.htm">Psalm 88</a> and 89, it has not only a considerable number of echoes of the book of Job, but also a lofty sweep, which is rather forced than lyrically direct, and appears to aim at copying the best models. </body></html>
