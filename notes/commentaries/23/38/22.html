It is well for us to remember the mercies we receive in sickness. Hezekiah records the condition he was in. He dwells upon this; I shall no more see the Lord. A good man wishes not to live for any other end than that he may serve God, and have communion with him. Our present residence is like that of a shepherd in his hut, a poor, mean, and cold lodging, and with a trust committed to our charge, as the shepherd has. Our days are compared to the weaver's shuttle, Job 7:6, passing and repassing very swiftly, every throw leaving a thread behind it; and when finished, the piece is cut off, taken out of the loom, and showed to our Master to be judged of. A good man, when his life is cut off, his cares and fatigues are cut off with it, and he rests from his labours. But our times are in God's hand; he has appointed what shall be the length of the piece. When sick, we are very apt to calculate our time, but are still at uncertainty. It should be more our care how we shall get safe to another world. And the more we taste of the loving-kindness of God, the more will our hearts love him, and live to him. It was in love to our poor perishing souls that Christ delivered them. The pardon does not make the sin not to have been sin, but not to be punished as it deserves. It is pleasant to think of our recoveries from sickness, when we see them flowing from the pardon of sin. Hezekiah's opportunity to glorify God in this world, he made the business, and pleasure, and end of life. Being recovered, he resolves to abound in praising and serving God. God's promises are not to do away, but to quicken and encourage the use of means. Life and health are given that we may glorify God and do good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hezekiah also had said - What evidence or proof have I that I shall be restored, and permitted to go to the temple?

The Syriac version transposes these verses, "Hezekiah had said, what is the sign? &amp;c. and Isaiah had answered, let them take a lump of figs", &amp;c. as if this latter was the sign; whereas it was that of the sun's going down ten degrees on the dial of Ahaz, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-7.htm">Isaiah 38:7</a>; see Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-7.htm">Isaiah 38:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-8.htm">Isaiah 38:8</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/38.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Hezekiah also <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> had said, What <i>is</i> the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?</span><p>(a) As in Isa 38:7.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hezekiah also had said</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and Hezekiah said.</span> Our translators, both in this verse and at the commencement of ver. 21, have endeavoured to conceal the awkwardness of the <span class="accented">nexus</span>, or rather want of <span class="accented">nexus</span>, with what precedes, by a modification of the rendering.

The Vav in &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; introduces the statement of his reason (Ges. 155, 1, c). On &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; ( equals  &#1492;&#1514;&#1491;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;), from &#1491;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; ( equals  &#1491;&#1468;&#1488;&#1491;&#1488;), see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-5.htm">Psalm 42:5</a>. The future here, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-15.htm">Isaiah 38:15</a>, gives the purpose of God concerning him. He was to walk (referring to the walk of life, not the walk to the temple) gently (without any disturbance) all his years upon the trouble of his soul, i.e., all the years that followed upon it, the years that were added to his life. This is the true explanation of &#1506;&#1500;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-5.htm">Isaiah 38:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-10.htm">Isaiah 32:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-25.htm">Leviticus 15:25</a>; not "in spite of" (Ewald), or "with," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-24.htm">Psalm 31:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>, where it forms an adverb. A better rendering than this would be "for," or "on account of," i.e., in humble salutary remembrance of the way in which God by His free grace averted the danger of death. What follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-16.htm">Isaiah 38:16</a> can only be regarded in connection with the petition in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-16.htm">Isaiah 38:16</a>, as Hezekiah's reply to the promise of God, which had been communicated to him by the prophet. Consequently the neuters &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503;( dna  (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-21.htm">Job 22:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-18.htm">Ezekiel 33:18-19</a>) refer to the gracious words and gracious acts of God. These are the true support of life (&#1506;&#1500; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>) for every man, and in these does the life of his spirit consist, i.e., his inmost and highest source of life, and that "on all sides" (&#1500;&#1499;&#1500;, which it would be more correct to point &#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-5.htm">1 Chronicles 7:5</a>; cf., bakko&#772;l, in every respect, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-5.htm">2 Samuel 23:5</a>). With this explanation, the conjecture of Ewald and Knobel, that the reading should be &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;, falls to the ground. From the general truth of which he had made a personal application, that the word of God is the source of all life, he drew this conclusion, which he here repeats with a retrospective glance, "So wilt Thou then make me whole (see the kal in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-4.htm">Job 39:4</a>), and keep me alive" (for &#1493;&#1514;&#1495;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;; with the hope passing over into a prayer). The praise for the fulfilment of the promise commences with the word hinne&#772;h (behold). His severe illness had been sent in anticipation of a happy deliverance (on the radical signification of mar, which is here doubled, to give it a superlative force, see Comm. on Job, at <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/16-2.htm">Job 16:2-5</a>). The Lord meant it for good; the suffering was indeed a chastisement, but it was a chastisement of love. Casting all his sins behind Him, as men do with things which they do not wish to know, or have no desire to be reminded of (compare e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-26.htm">Nehemiah 9:26</a>), He "loved him out," i.e., drew him lovingly out, of the pit of destruction (cha&#770;shaq, love as a firm inward bond; bel&#305;&#772;, which is generally used as a particle, stands here in its primary substantive signification, from ba&#770;la&#770;h, to consume). </body></html>
