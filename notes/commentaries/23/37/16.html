They were formed out of the same mass of pure gold as the mercy seat itself (Ex 25:19, Margin). The phrase, "dwellest between the cherubim," arose from their position at each end of the mercy seat, while the Shekinah, and the awful name, Jehovah, in written letters, were in the intervening space. They are so inseparably associated with the manifestation of God's glory, that whether the Lord is at rest or in motion, they always are mentioned with Him (Nu 7:89; Ps 18:10). (1) They are first mentioned (Ge 3:24) "on the edge of" (as "on the east" may be translated) Eden; the Hebrew for "placed" is properly to "place in a tabernacle," which implies that this was a local tabernacle in which the symbols of God's presence were manifested suitably to the altered circumstances in which man, after the fall, came before God. It was here that Cain and Abel, and the patriarchs down to the flood, presented their offerings: and it is called "the presence of the Lord" (Ge 4:16). When those symbols were removed at the close of that early patriarchal dispensation, small models of them were made for domestic use, called, in Chaldee, "seraphim" or "teraphim." (2) The cherubim, in the Mosaic tabernacle and Solomon's temple, were the same in form as those at the outskirts of Eden: compound figures, combining the distinguishing properties of several creatures: the ox, chief among the tame and useful animals; the lion among the wild ones; the eagle among birds; and man, the head of all (the original headship of man over the animal kingdom, about to be restored in Jesus Christ, Ps 8:4-8, is also implied in this combination). They are, throughout Scripture, represented as distinct from God; they could not be likenesses of Him which He forbade in any shape. (3) They are introduced in the third or gospel dispensation (Re 4:6) as "living creatures" (not so well translated "beasts" in English Version), not angels, but beings closely connected with the redeemed Church. So also in Eze 1:5-25; 10:1-22. Thus, throughout the three dispensations, they seem to be symbols of those who in every age should officially study and proclaim the manifold wisdom of God.<p>thou alone&#8212;literally, "Thou art He who alone art God of all the kingdoms"; whereas Sennacherib had classed Jehovah with the heathen gods, he asserts the nothingness of the latter and the sole lordship of the former.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/37.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/37.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubim,....

It has been <span class="accented">questioned</span> whether Hezekiah was really as pronounced a monotheist as these expressions would imply, and suggested that  his actual words received "a colouring" from a later writer. Hezekiah's contemporaries, it is said, Isaiah and Micah, make no such strong statements of their belief in one only God as this (Kuenen, Cheyne). But it is difficult to see what can be a clearer revelation of monotheism than <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-5</a>, or what truth more absolutely underlies the whole of Isaiah's teaching than the unity of the Supreme Being. The same under-current is observable in Micah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-2.htm">Micah 1:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-5.htm">Micah 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-17.htm">Micah 7:17, 18</a>). Sennacherib's belief, that each country has its own god (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-18.htm">Isaiah 36:18-20</a>), is not shared by the religious Jews of his time. They are well aware that the heathen gods are "vanity" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-3.htm">Isaiah 46:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-5.htm">Amos 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-8.htm">Jonah 2:8</a>), "wind" and "confusion" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-29.htm">Isaiah 41:29</a>, etc.).

There is historical importance in the fact, that here Sennacherib attributes to his fathers (Sargon and the previous kings of the Derketade dynasty which he had overthrown) what Rabshakeh on the occasion of the first mission had imputed to Sennacherib himself. On Gozan, see p. 33. It is no doubt identical with the Zuzan of the Arabian geographers, which is described as a district of outer Armenia, situated on the Chabur, e.g., in the Merasid. ("The Chabur is the Chabur of el-Hasaniye, a district of Mosul, to the east of the Tigris; it comes down from the mountains of the land of Zuzan, flows through a broad and thickly populated country in the north of Mosul, which is called outer Armenia, and empties itself into the Tigris." Ptolemy, on the other hand (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-18.htm">Isaiah 37:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-14.htm">Isaiah 37:14</a>), is acquainted with a Mesopotamian Gauzanitis; and, looking upon northern Mesopotamia as the border land of Armenia, he says, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834; &#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; (not far from Edessa) &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c6; &#x3b7;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3a7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, possibly the district of Gulzan, in which Nisibin, the ancient Nisibis, still stands.<p>(Note: See Oppert, Expdition, i.60.)<p>For Hrn (Syr. Horon; Joseph. Charran of Mesopotamia), the present Harrn, not far from Charmelik, see Genesis, p. 327. The Harran in the Guta of Damascus (on the southern arm of the Harus), which Beke has recently identified with it, is not connected with it in any way. Retseph is the Rhesapha of Ptol. v. 18, 6, below Thapsacus, the present Rusafa in the Euphrates-valley of ez-Zor, between the Euphrates and Tadmur (Palmyra; see Robinson, Pal.). Telassar, with which the Targum (ii. iii.) and Syr. confound the Ellasar of <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-1.htm">Genesis 14:1</a>, i.e., Artemita (Artamita), is not the Thelseae of the Itin. Antonini and of the Notitia dignitatum - in which case the Bene&#772;-&#8219;Eden might be the tribe of Bt Genn (Bettegene) on the southern slope of Lebanon (i.e., the 'Eden of Coelesyria, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-5.htm">Amos 1:5</a>; the Paradeisos of Ptol. v. 15, 20; Paradisus, Plin. v. 19) - but the Thelser of the Tab. Peuting., on the eastern side of the Tigris; and Bene&#772;-&#8219;Eden is the tribe of the 'Eden mentioned by Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-23.htm">Ezekiel 27:23</a>) after Haran and Ctesiphon. Consequently the enumeration of the warlike deeds describes a curve, which passes in a north-westerly direction through Hamath and Arpad, and then returns in Sepharvaim to the border of southern Mesopotamia and Babylonia. 'Ir-Sepharvaim is like 'Ir-Nchs, 'Ir-shemesh, etc. The legends connect the name with the sacred books. The form of the name is inexplicable; but the name itself probably signifies the double shore (after the Aramaean), as the city, which was the southernmost of the leading places of Mesopotamia, was situated on the Euphrates. The words &#1493;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1504;&#1506;, if not take as proper names, would signify, "he has taken away, and overthrown;" but in that case we should expect &#1493;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; or &#1493;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;. They are really the names of cities which it is no longer possible to trace. Hena' is hardly the well-known Avatho on the Euphrates, as Gesenius, V. Niebuhr, and others suppose; and 'Ivah, the seat of the Avv&#305;&#772;m (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-31.htm">2 Kings 17:31</a>), agrees still less, so far as the sound of the word is concerned, with "the province of Hebeh (? Hebeb: Ritter, Erdk. xi. 707), situated between Anah and the Chabur on the Euphrates," with which V. Niebuhr combines it.<p>(Note: For other combinations of equal value, see Oppert, Expdition, i. 220.) </body></html>
