Their spirits sank; they were ashamed of their feeble powers of resistance; and they submitted to the ignominy of a surrender.<p>They were as the grass of the field - The same idea is expressed by Sennacherib himself in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-15.htm">Isaiah 10:15</a>, though under a different image (see the note on that verse). The idea here is, as the grass of the field offers no resistance to the march of an army, so it was with the strongly fortified towns in the way of Sennacherib.<p>As the grass on the housetops - In eastern countries the roofs of houses are always flat. They are made of a mixture of sand gravel, or earth; and on the houses of the rich there is a firmly constructed flooring made of coals, chalk, gypsum, and ashes, made hard by being beaten or rolled. On these roofs spears of wheat, barley, or grass sometimes spring up, but they are soon withered by the heat of the sun <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/129-6.htm">Psalm 129:6-8</a>. The idea here, therefore, is that of the greatest feebleness. His enemies were not simply like the grass in the field, but they were like the thin, slender, and delicate blade that sprung up in the little earth on the roof of a house, where there was no room for the roots to strike down, and where it soon withered beneath the burning sun.<p>As corn blasted before it is grown up - Before it acquires any strength. The idea in all these phrases is substantially the same - that they were incapable of offering even the feeblest resistance. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27.

The original is not so emphatic, but still contains the idea, not merely of sequence, but of consequence. God, having decreed the successes of the Assyrians, effected them (in part) by infusing weakness into the nations that were their adversaries. <span class="cmt_word">They were as the grass of the field</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6, 7</a>). The comparison is one constantly used by the Hebrew psalmists (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-2.htm">Psalm 37:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-5.htm">Psalm 90:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-7.htm">Psalm 92:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15</a>), and was not unknown to the Assyrians ('Records of the Past,' vol. 3. p. 41; vol. 5. p. 14). The delicate grass of spring in the East withers within a few weeks, and the fresh and tender herbage becomes yellow, parched, and sapless. The grass that springs upon the earthen roofs of houses fails even more rapidly (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-6.htm">Psalm 129:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As corn blasted before it be grown up</span>; literally, <span class="accented">like a field before the stalk.</span> Our translators seem to have rightly preferred the reading of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-26.htm">2 Kings 19:26</a> (<span class="accented">sh'dephah</span>, equivalent to "blasting") to that of Isaiah (<span class="accented">sh'demah</span>, equivalent to "field") in this place. Their rendering brings out the true sense. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/37.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet's reply. "And Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hizkiyahu, saying, Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me concerning Sennacherib the king of Asshur (K. adds, I have heard): this is the utterance which Jehovah utters concerning him." He sent, i.e., sent a message, viz., by one of his disciples (limmu&#772;d&#305;&#772;m, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-16.htm">Isaiah 8:16</a>). According to the text of Isaiah, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; would commence the protasis to &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1494;&#1492; (as for that which - this is the utterance); or, as the Vav of the apodosis is wanting, it might introduce relative clauses to what precedes ("I, to whom:" Ges. 123, 1, Anm. 1). But both of these are very doubtful. We cannot dispense with &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (I have heard), which is given by both the lxx and Syr. in the text of Isaiah, as well as that of Kings.<p>The prophecy of Isaiah which follows here, is in all respects one of the most magnificent that we meet with. It proceeds with strophe-like strides on the cothurnus of the Deborah style: "The virgin daughter of Zion despiseth thee, laugheth thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem shaketh her head after thee. Whom hast thou reviled and blasphemed, and over whom hast thou spoken loftily, that thou hast lifted up thine eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel." The predicate is written at the head, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-22.htm">Isaiah 37:22</a>, in the masculine, i.e., without any precise definition; since &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1492; is a verb &#1500; &#1492;, and neither the participle nor the third pers. fem. of &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;. Zion is called a virgin, with reference to the shame with which it was threatened though without success (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-12.htm">Isaiah 23:12</a>); bethu&#772;lath bath are subordinate appositions, instead of co-ordinate. With a contented and heightened self-consciousness, she shakes her head behind him as he retreats with shame, saying by her attitude, as she moves her head backwards and forwards, that it must come to this, and could not be otherwise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15-16</a>). The question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-23.htm">Isaiah 37:23</a> reaches as far as &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, although, according to the accents, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-23.htm">Isaiah 37:23</a> is an affirmative clause: "and thou turnest thine eyes on high against the Holy One of Israel" (Hitzig, Ewald, Drechsler, and Keil). The question is put for the purpose of saying to Asshur, that He at whom they scoff is the God of Israel, whose pure holiness breaks out into a consuming fire against all by whom it is dishonoured. The fut. cons. &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1492; is essentially the same as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-12.htm">Isaiah 51:12-13</a>, and &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501; is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>. </body></html>
