As that had failed, he, as a last resort, sent a similar message to Hezekiah himself, designed to alienate his mind from God, and assuring him that resistance would be vain. To convince him, he referred him <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-11.htm">Isaiah 37:11-13</a> to the conquests of the Assyrians, and assured him that it would be impossible to resist a nation that had subdued so many ethers.

Sennacherib’s letter to Hezekiah. It is in substance a repetition of the chief argument of the Rabshakeh, with the unimportant modification that Hezekiah is here regarded as deceived by his God, while the Rabshakeh chose to represent him as a deceiver of his people.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee</span>. Sennacherib recognized Jehovah as a god, the God of the Jews, but put him on a par with the other "gods of the nations" (ver. 11), and (lid not believe in his being able to contend with Asshur. If he were really, through his priests or prophets, giving Hezekiah assurances of protection and deliverance, he could only be "deceiving" him. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/37.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The king and the deputation apply to Isaiah. "And it came to pass, when king Hizkiyahu had heard, he rent his clothes, and wrapped himself in mourning linen, and went into the house of Jehovah. And sent Eliakim the house-minister, and Shebna (K. omits &#1488;&#1514;) the chancellor, and the eldest of the priests, wrapped in mourning linen, to Isaiah son of Amoz, the prophet (K. has what is inadmissible: the prophet son of Amoz). And they said to him, Thus saith Hizkiyahu, A day of affliction, and punishment, and blasphemy is this day; for children are come to the matrix, and there is no strength to bring them forth. Perhaps Jehovah thy God will hear the words (K. all the words) of Rabshakeh, with which the king of Asshur his lord has sent him to revile the living God; and Jehovah thy God will punish for the words which He hath heard, and thou wilt make intercession for the remnant that still exists." The distinguished embassy is a proof of the distinction of the prophet himself (Knobel). The character of the deputation accorded with its object, which was to obtain a consolatory word for the king and people. In the form of the instructions we recognise again the flowing style of Isaiah. &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1492;, as a synonym of &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;, &#1504;&#1511;&#1501;, is used as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-9.htm">Hosea 5:9</a>; &#1504;&#1488;&#1510;&#1492; (from the kal &#1504;&#1488;&#1509;) according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-5.htm">Isaiah 52:5</a>, like &#1504;&#1488;&#1510;&#1492; (from the piel &#1504;&#1488;&#1509;), <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-18.htm">Nehemiah 9:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-26.htm">Nehemiah 9:26</a> (reviling, i.e., reviling of God, or blasphemy). The figure of there not being sufficient strength to bring forth the child, is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-9.htm">Isaiah 66:9</a>. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; (from &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;, syn. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1509;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-29.htm">Genesis 38:29</a>) does not signify the actual birth (Luzzatto, punto di dover nascere), nor the delivering-stool (Targum), like mashbe&#772;r shel-chayya&#770;h, the delivering-stool of the midwife (Kelim xxiii. 4); but as the subject is the children, and not the mother, the matrix or mouth of the womb, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/13-13.htm">Hosea 13:13</a>, "He (Ephraim) is an unwise child; when it is time does he not stop in the children's passage" (mashbe&#772;r ba&#770;n&#305;&#772;m), i.e., the point which a child must pass, not only with its head, but also with its shoulders and its whole body, for which the force of the pains is often not sufficient? The existing condition of the state resembled such unpromising birth-pains, which threatened both the mother and the fruit of the womb with death, because the matrix would not open to give birth to the child. &#1500;&#1491;&#1492; like &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>. The timid inquiry, which hardly dared to hope, commences with 'u&#772;lai. The following future is continued in perfects, the force of which is determined by it: "and He (namely Jehovah, the Targum and Syriac) will punish for the words," or, as we point it, "there will punish for the words which He hath heard, Jehovah thy God (ho&#772;kh&#305;&#772;ach, referring to a judicial decision, as in a general sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>); and thou wilt lift up prayer" (i.e., begin to offer it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4</a>). "He will hear," namely as judge and deliverer; "He hath heard," namely as the omnipresent One. The expression, "to revile the living God" (lecha&#770;re&#772;ph 'Elo&#772;h&#305;&#772;m chai), sounds like a comparison of Rabshakeh to Goliath (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-26.htm">1 Samuel 17:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-36.htm">1 Samuel 17:36</a>). The "existing remnant" was Jerusalem, which was not yet in the enemy's hand (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8-9</a>). The deliverance of the remnant is a key-note of Isaiah's prophecies. But the prophecy would not be fulfilled, until the grace which fulfilled it had been met by repentance and faith. Hence Hezekiah's weak faith sues for the intercession of the prophet, whose personal relation to God is here set forth as a closer one than that of the king and priests. </body></html>
