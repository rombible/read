Strictly speaking, Sargon, the father of Sennacherib, was the founder of a new dynasty; but the “fathers” are, as commonly in the formulæ of Eastern kings, the predecessors of the reigning king. The position of Gozan is defined by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-6.htm" title="In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.">2Kings 17:6</a> as being on the Habor, or <span class= "ital">Khabûr, </span>which flows into the Tigris from the east, above Mosul. Haran is probably identical with Abraham’s resting-place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm" title="And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and dwelled there.">Genesis 11:31</a>), and the Charran of Josephus and St. Stephen’s speech (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-4.htm" title="Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelled in Charran: and from there, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein you now dwell.">Acts 7:4</a>). “Rezeph” is identified with the Rhesepher of Ptolemy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-13.htm" title="Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.">Isaiah 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-6.htm" title="And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor dig; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain on it.">Isaiah 5:6</a>) below Thapeacus, between the ’Euphrates and Tadmor (= Palmyra). Telassar is probably an altered form of Tel-Assur (the hill of Assur), and was probably a new name given to a conquered city, after the manner in which Shalmaneser records that he gave names to cities that he had taken belonging to Akhuni, the son of Adini (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, iii.</span> 87, v. 30). In the patronymic we may trace <span class= "ital">the sons of Eden </span>of this verse. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-5.htm" title="I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holds the scepter from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity to Kir, said the LORD.">Amos 1:5</a> we have a Beth-Eden named as connected with Damascus; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-23.htm" title="Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad, were your merchants.">Ezekiel 27:23</a> an “Eden” connected with Haran and Asshur, as carrying on traffic with Tyre. The latter is probably identical with that named by Sennacherib.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/37.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>37:1-38 This chapter is the same as 2Ki 19<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My fathers - My predecessors on the throne.<p>Gozan - This was a region or country in the northern part of Mesopotamia, and on the river Chaboras. There was a river of the name of Gozan in Media, which ran through the province, and gave it its name. The river fell probably into the Chaboras. This region is known to have been under the dominion of Assyria, for Shalmaneser, when he had subdued the ten tribes, carried them away beyond the Euphrates to a country bordering on the river Gozan <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>. According to Gesenius, the river which is referred to, is the Chaboras itself. He translates the passage in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>, thus: 'And placed them in Chaleitis (Halah), and on the Chabor (Habor), a river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.' According to this, the river was the Chaboras, the Chabor of Ezekiel, and the region was situated on the Chaboras. This river falls into the Euphrates from the east. Ptolemy calls the region lying between the Chaboras and Laocoras by the name of Gauzanitis, which is doubtless the same as the Hebrew Gozan. Gozan is usually mentioned in connection with cities of Mesopotamia <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-12.htm">2 Kings 19:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>.<p>And Haran - This was a city of Mesopotamia, to which Abraham went after he left Ur of the Chaldees. His father died here; and from this place he was called to go into the land of promise (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31-32</a>; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-4.htm">Acts 7:4</a>). It is now called Harran, and is situated in latitude 36 degree 52 minutes north; longitude 39 degrees 5 minutes east, in a flat and sandy plain, and is only populated by a few wandering Arabs, who select it as the place of residence on account of the delicious waters it contains. It belonged by conquest to the Assyrian Empire.<p>And Rezeph - According to Abulfeda, there were many towns of this name. One, however, was more celebrated than the others, and is probably the one here referred to. It was situated about a day's journey west of the Euphrates, and is mentioned by Ptolemy by the name of &#x3a1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;  Re&#772;sapha (Resapha).<p>And the children of Eden - Eden was evidently a country well known in the time of Isaiah, and was, doubtless, the tract within which man was placed when he was created. The garden or Paradise was in Eden, and was not properly itself called Eden <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>. It is probable that Eden was a region or tract of country of considerable extent. Its situation has been a subject of anxious inquiry. It is not proper here to go into an examination of this subject. It is evident from the passage before us that it was either in Mesopotamia, or in the neighborhood of that country, since it is mentioned in connection with cities and towns of that region. It is mentioned by Amos (787 b.c.), as a country then well known, and as a part of Syria, not far from Damascus:<p>I will break also the bar of Damascus,<p>And cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven,<p>And him that holdeth the scepter from the house of Eden,<p>And the people of Syria shall go into captivity to Kir,<p>Saith the Lord.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. Gozan&#8212;in Mesopotamia, on the Chabour (2Ki 17:6; 18:11). Gozan is the name of the district, Chabour of the river.<p>Haran&#8212;more to the west. Abraham removed to it from Ur (Ge 11:31); the Carroe of the Romans.<p>Rezeph&#8212;farther west, in Syria.<p>Eden&#8212;There is an ancient village, Adna, north of Baghdad.

They have not. But what then? is the God of Israel to be put upon a level with such dunghill gods? so Sennacherib reckoned him, as Rabshakeh before, in his name, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-18.htm">Isaiah 36:18</a>, <p>as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden, which were in Telassar. Gozan was the same, it may be, with the Gausanitis of Ptolemy (z) which he makes mention of in his description of Mesopotamia; and the rather, since Haran or Chapman was a city of Mesopotamia, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a> called by Ptolemy by the name of Carrae (a); and who also, in the same place, makes mention of Rezeph, under the name of Rhescipha; though he likewise speaks of another place in Palmyrene in Syria, called Rhaesapha (b), which some think to be the place here intended. Eden was also in Mesopotamia, in the eastern part of which was the garden of Eden; and this Telassar, inhabited by the children of Eden, was a city in that country, which is by Ptolemy (c) called Thelda; though Hillerus (d) is of opinion that the city Thalatha is meant, which is placed (e) near the river Tigris, a river of paradise. A very learned (f) men is of opinion, that the Eden, Isaiah here speaks of, belongs either to Syria of Damascus, and to the Lebanon and Paneas from whence Jordan arose; or to Syro-Phoenicia, and the Mediterranean sea, which the name Thalassar shows, as if it was  the Syrians being used to derive not a few of their words from the Greeks: and certain it is, that there is now a village called Eden on Mount Lebanon, which Thevenot (g) mentions; and another, near Damascus, Mr. Maundrell (h) speaks of; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-5.htm">Amos 1:5</a> and Tyre in Phoenicia is called Eden, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>. <p>(z) Geograph, l. 5. c. 18.

The place-names in this verse are all found on the Assyrian monuments. (See Schrader, <span class="ital">Cuneiform Inscriptions</span>, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-12.htm" title="Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar?">2 Kings 19:12</a>.) <span class="ital">Gozan</span> (Assyr. <span class="ital">Guzana</span>) is one of the places to which the Northern Israelites were exiled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-6.htm" title="In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.">2 Kings 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-11.htm" title="And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel to Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes:">2 Kings 18:11</a>); it lay on the river Chaboras, a northern affluent of the Euphrates. <span class="ital">Haran</span> is the well-known commercial emporium of northern Mesopotamia, on another tributary (the Belikh) west of the Chaboras. <span class="ital">Rezeph</span> (Assyr. <span class="ital">Raṣappa</span>) is about 20 miles south of the Euphrates on the route from Haran to Palmyra. <span class="ital">Telassar</span> is in Assyrian <span class="ital">Til-Assuri</span> (“Hill of Asshur”), a name likely to be of frequent occurrence. The place here can hardly be the Babylonian Til-Assuri mentioned in the monuments; it may rather have been one of the cities of <span class="ital">Eden</span>, i.e. the small kingdom called <span class="ital">Bit-Adini</span> on the Upper Euphrates.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My fathers</span>. The Assyrian monarchs call all those who have preceded them upon the throne their "fathers," without intending to claim any blood-relation-ship. Sargon, Sennacherib's father, though a usurper and the first king of a new dynasty, frequently speaks of "the kings his fathers" ('Records of the Past,' ch. 7. pp. 39, 51, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Gozan...  Haran ...   Rezeph...  Telassar</span>. "Gozan" is, beyond all doubt, the region known to the Greeks as Gauzanitis, which was the eastern portion of Upper Mesopotamia, or the country about the sources of the Khabour river. The <span class="accented">Assyrian</span> conquest of this tract is indicated by the settlement of the Israelites in the region (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-11.htm">2 Kings 18:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>). "Harsh" is the well-known "city of Nahor" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-10.htm">Genesis 24:10</a>), called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a> "<span class="accented">Charran</span>," and by the Greeks and Romans, Carrhae. It has now recovered its old designation, and is known as <span class="accented">Hurrah.</span> "Rezeph" was in the neighborhood of Haran, and is mentioned as belonging to Assyria as early as  <span class="date">B.C. 775</span> ('Eponym Canon,' p. 82). It had probably revolted and been reduced at a later date. "Telassar," "the Hill of <span class="accented">Asshur</span>," is not mentioned in the Assyrian inscriptions, but was probably the Assyrian name of a town on or near the Euphrates, in the country of the Bent-Eden, which was not far from Carche-mish (see 'Records of the Past,' ch. 3. pp. 90-92). <span class="cmt_word">The children of Eden</span>. The Assyrian inscriptions mention a "Bit-Adini" (comp. <span class="accented">Amos</span> 1:5), and a chief who is called "the son of Adini;" both belonging to the Middle Euphrates region.

"And the servants of king Hizkiyahu came to Isaiah. And Isaiah said to them (&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, K. &#1500;&#1492;&#1501;), Speak thus to your lord, Thus saith Jehovah, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Asshur have blasphemed me! Behold, I will bring a spirit upon him, and he will hear a hearsay, and return to his land; and I cut him down with the sword in his own land." Luzzatto, without any necessity, takes &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-3.htm">Isaiah 37:3</a> in the modal sense of what they were to do (e dovevano dirgli): they were to say this to him, but he anticipated them at once with the instructions given here. The fact, so far as the style is concerned, is rather this, that <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-5.htm">Isaiah 37:5</a>, while pointing back, gives the ground for <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-6.htm">Isaiah 37:6</a> : "and when they had come to him (saying this), he said to them." &#1504;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497; we render "servants" (Knappen)<p>(Note: Knappe is the same word as "Knave;" but we have no word in use now which is an exact equivalent, and knave has entirely lost its original sense of servant. - Tr.)<p>after <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-2.htm">Esther 2:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-3.htm">Esther 6:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/6-5.htm">Esther 6:5</a>; it is a more contemptuous expression than &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;. The ru&#772;a&#774;ch mentioned here as sent by God is a superior force of a spiritual kind, which influences both thought and conduct, as in such other connections as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-14.htm">Isaiah 19:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-6.htm">Isaiah 28:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a> (Psychol. p. 295, Anm.).<p>The external occasion which determined the return of Sennacherib, as described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36-37</a>, was the fearful mortality that had taken place in his army. The shemu&#772;&#8219;a&#770;h (rumour, hearsay), however, was not the tidings of this catastrophe, but, as the continuation of the account in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-8.htm">Isaiah 37:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-9.htm">Isaiah 37:9</a>, clearly shows, the report of the advance of Tirhakah, which compelled Sennacherib to leave Palestine in consequence of this catastrophe. The prediction of his death is sufficiently special to be regarded by modern commentators, who will admit nothing but the most misty figures as prophecies, as a vaticinium post eventum. At the same time, the prediction of the event which would drive the Assyrian out of the land is intentionally couched in these general terms. The faith of the king, and of the inquirers generally, still needed to be tested and exercised. The time had not yet come for him to be rewarded by a clearer and fuller announcement of the judgment. </body></html>
