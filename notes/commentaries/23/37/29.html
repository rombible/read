The language is taken from the custom of putting a ring or hook in the nose of a wild animal for the purpose of governing and guiding it. The most violent animals may be thus completely governed, and this is often done with those animals that are fierce and untameable. The Arabs often pursue this course in regard to the camel; and thus have it under entire control. A similar image is used in respect to the king of Egypt <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-4.htm">Ezekiel 29:4</a>.

The rage which Sennacherib expressed both by Rabshakeh, and in his letter against Hezekiah and his people, is taken by the Lord as against himself; so great was his care of them, and concern for them; and indeed there was a great deal of blasphemy belched out against himself; and so the Syriac version renders the next word, translated "tumult", "thy blasphemy"; though that may rather intend the blustering noise that Rabshakeh made, or the noise of the Assyrian army, the chariots and horsemen, and the multitude of the soldiers, which was not only heard by the Jews, and was terrible to them, but was taken notice of by the Lord, who had it in derision; hence he adds: <p>therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips; comparing Sennacherib to leviathan, or the great whale, or to some very large and unruly fish, not easily caught and managed; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1</a>, or to a bear, or buffalo, in whose noses men put iron rings, and lead them about at pleasure; and also to a horse or mule, which are managed by the bit and bridle; signifying hereby the strength, fierceness, and fury of the Assyrian monarch, and the power of God to restrain him, which he could easily do: <p>and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest; from Jerusalem, the same way he came to it, to his own land again, and so he did, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-37.htm">Isaiah 37:37</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/37.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into my ears, therefore I will put my <span class="cverse3">{u}</span> hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou <span class="cverse3">{x}</span> camest.</span><p>(u) Because Sennacherib showed himself as a devouring fish and furious beast, he uses these similarities to teach how he will take him and guide him.<p>(x) You will lose your labour.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/37.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">29</span>.

The Assyrians were in the habit of passing "hooks" or "rings" through the noses or lips of their more distinguished prisoners, and attaching a thong to the hook or ring, by which they led the prisoners into the royal presence ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. p. 304; vol. 3. p. 436). The expressions used derive their force from these practices, but are not in the present place to be understood literally. God "turned Sennacherib back" and reconducted him to Nineveh. not with an actual "hook" or "thong," but by the "bridle" of necessity. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/37.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet's reply. "And Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hizkiyahu, saying, Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me concerning Sennacherib the king of Asshur (K. adds, I have heard): this is the utterance which Jehovah utters concerning him." He sent, i.e., sent a message, viz., by one of his disciples (limmu&#772;d&#305;&#772;m, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-16.htm">Isaiah 8:16</a>). According to the text of Isaiah, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; would commence the protasis to &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1494;&#1492; (as for that which - this is the utterance); or, as the Vav of the apodosis is wanting, it might introduce relative clauses to what precedes ("I, to whom:" Ges. 123, 1, Anm. 1). But both of these are very doubtful. We cannot dispense with &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (I have heard), which is given by both the lxx and Syr. in the text of Isaiah, as well as that of Kings.<p>The prophecy of Isaiah which follows here, is in all respects one of the most magnificent that we meet with. It proceeds with strophe-like strides on the cothurnus of the Deborah style: "The virgin daughter of Zion despiseth thee, laugheth thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem shaketh her head after thee. Whom hast thou reviled and blasphemed, and over whom hast thou spoken loftily, that thou hast lifted up thine eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel." The predicate is written at the head, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-22.htm">Isaiah 37:22</a>, in the masculine, i.e., without any precise definition; since &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1492; is a verb &#1500; &#1492;, and neither the participle nor the third pers. fem. of &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;. Zion is called a virgin, with reference to the shame with which it was threatened though without success (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-12.htm">Isaiah 23:12</a>); bethu&#772;lath bath are subordinate appositions, instead of co-ordinate. With a contented and heightened self-consciousness, she shakes her head behind him as he retreats with shame, saying by her attitude, as she moves her head backwards and forwards, that it must come to this, and could not be otherwise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15-16</a>). The question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-23.htm">Isaiah 37:23</a> reaches as far as &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, although, according to the accents, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-23.htm">Isaiah 37:23</a> is an affirmative clause: "and thou turnest thine eyes on high against the Holy One of Israel" (Hitzig, Ewald, Drechsler, and Keil). The question is put for the purpose of saying to Asshur, that He at whom they scoff is the God of Israel, whose pure holiness breaks out into a consuming fire against all by whom it is dishonoured. The fut. cons. &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1492; is essentially the same as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-12.htm">Isaiah 51:12-13</a>, and &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501; is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>. </body></html>
