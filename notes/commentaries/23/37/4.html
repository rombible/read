He had heard them; but the sense is, that it might be that he would take notice of them, and resent them in a public manner, and punish for them; and this is said, not as doubting and questioning whether he would or not, but as hoping and encouraging himself that he would: and it may be observed, that Hezekiah does not call the Lord "my God", or "our God", because he and his people were under the chastening hand of God for their sins, and were undeserving of such a relation; but "thy God", whose prophet he was, whom he served, and to whom he was dear, and with whom he had an interest; and therefore it might be hoped his prayer to him would be heard and accepted, and that through his interposition God would be prevailed upon to take notice of the railing speech of Rabshakeh: <p>whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; who has life in and of himself, and is the fountain, author, and giver of life to all others; him he reproached by setting him on a level with the lifeless idols of the Gentiles: <p>and will reprove the words which the Lord thy God hath heard; reprove him for his words, take vengeance upon him, or punish him for the blasphemous words spoken by him against the Lord and in his hearing: to this sense is the Targum; and so the Syriac and Arabic versions: <p>wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left; lift up thy voice, thy hands, and thine heart, in prayer to God in heaven; pray earnestly and fervently for those that are left; the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin, the other ten having been carried captive some time ago; or the inhabitants of Jerusalem particularly, the defenced cities of Judah having been already taken by the Assyrian king. The fewness of the number that remained seems to be made use of as an argument for prayer in their favour. In times of distress, men should not only pray for themselves, but get others to pray for them, and especially men of eminence in religion, who have nearness of access to God, and interest in him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/37.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">It may be the LORD thy God will <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> lift up <i>thy</i> prayer for the remnant that is left.</span><p>(d) That is, will declare by effect that he has heard it: for when God defers to punish, it seems to the flesh, that he knows not the sin, or hears not the cause.<p>(e) Declaring that the ministers office stands not only in comforting by the word, but also in praying for the people.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/37.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">It may be</span>] Or “Peradventure.” The one hope is that Jehovah will take notice of the dishonour done to His name by the threats and blasphemies of the Assyrian king. <span class="ital">the Lord thy God</span>] See ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-13.htm" title="And he said, Hear you now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will you weary my God also?">Isaiah 7:13</a>.

In opposition to the dead idols of the heathen, which had neither life, nor breath, nor perception (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-15.htm">Psalm 135:15-18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The remnant that is left</span>. It is usual to explain this of Judah generally, which still survived, although Israel had been carried away captive. But perhaps the contrast is rather between the numerous <span class="accented">Judaean</span> captives who had been taken and conveyed to Assyria by Sennacherib when he took the "fenced cities" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-1.htm">Isaiah 36:1</a>), and the portion of the nation which still remained in the land. Sennacherib says, in his annals, that he took "forty-six" cities, and carried captive to Assyria above two hundred thousand persons ('Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 38). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After Rabshakeh had refused the request of Hezekiah's representatives in this contemptuous manner, he turned in defiance of them to the people themselves. "Then Rabshakeh went near, and cried with a loud voice in the Jewish language (K. and spake), and said, Hear the words (K. the word) of the great king, the king of Asshur. Thus saith the king, Let not Hizkiyahu practise deception upon you (&#1497;&#1505;&#1492;, K. &#1497;&#1505;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488;)); for he cannot deliver you (K. out of his hand). And let not Hizkiyahu feed you with hope in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will deliver, yea, deliver us: (K. and) this city will not be delivered into the hand of the king of Asshur. Hearken not to Hizkiyahu: for thus saith the king (hammelekh, K. melekh) of Asshur, Enter into a connection of mutual good wishes with me, and come out to me: and enjoy every one his vine, and every one his fig-tree, and drink every one the water of his cistern; till I come and take you away into a land like your land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread-corn and vineyards (K. a land full of fine olive-trees and honey, and live and do not die, and hearken not to Hizkiyahu); that Hizkiyahu to not befool you (K. for he befools you), saying, Jehovah will deliver us! Have the gods of the nations delivered (K. really delivered) every one his land out of the hand of the king of Asshur? Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where the gods of Sepharvayim (K. adds, Hena&#8219; and &#8219;Ivah)? and how much less (&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;, K. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;) have they delivered that Samaria out of my hand? Who were they among all the gods of these (K. of the) lands, who delivered their land out of my hand? how much less will Jehovah deliver Jerusalem out of my hand!? The chronicler also has this continuation of Rabshakeh's address in part (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-13.htm">2 Chronicles 32:13-15</a>), but he has fused into one the Assyrian self-praise uttered by Rabshakeh on his first and second mission. The encouragement of the people, by referring to the help of Jehovah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-6.htm">2 Chronicles 32:6-8</a>), is placed by him before this first account is given by Isaiah, and forms a conclusion to the preparations for the contest with Asshur as there described. Rabshakeh now draws nearer to the wall, and harangues the people. &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1488; is construed here with a dative (to excite treacherous hopes); whereas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-15.htm">2 Chronicles 32:15</a> it is written with an accusative. The reading &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493; is altered from &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-20.htm">Isaiah 36:20</a>, which is inserted still more frequently by the chronicler. The reading &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; with &#1514;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1503; is incorrect; it would require &#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1503; (Ges. 143, 1a). To make a bera&#770;kha&#770;h with a person was equivalent to entering into a relation of blessing, i.e., into a state of mind in which each wished all prosperity to the other. This was probably a common phrase, though we only meet with it here. &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;, when applied to the besieged, is equivalent to surrendering (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-3.htm">1 Samuel 11:3</a>). If they did that, they should remain in quiet possession and enjoyment, until the Assyrian fetched them away (after the Egyptian campaign was over), and transported them to a land which he describes to them in the most enticing terms, in order to soften down the inevitable transportation. It is a question whether the expansion of this picture in the book of Kings is original or not; since &#1493;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1504;&#1506; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-19.htm">Isaiah 36:19</a> appears to be also tacked on here from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-13.htm">Isaiah 37:13</a> (see at this passage). On Hamath and Arpad (to the north of Haleb in northern Syria, and a different place from Arvad  equals  Arad), see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>. Sepharvayim (a dual form, the house of the Sepharv&#305;&#772;m, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-31.htm">2 Kings 17:31</a>) is the Sipphara of Ptol. v. 18, 7, the southernmost city of Mesopotamia, on the left bank of the Euphrates; Pliny's Hipparenum on the Narraga, i.e., the canal, nehar malka&#770;, the key to the irrigating or inundating works of Babylon, which were completed afterwards by Nebuchadnezzar (Plin. h. n. vi. 30); probably the same place as the sun-city, Sippara, in which Xisuthros concealed the sacred books before the great flood (see K. Mller's Fragmenta Historicorum Gr. ii.-501-2). &#1508;&#1468;&#1503; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-18.htm">Isaiah 36:18</a> has a warning meaning (as if it followed &#1500;&#1499;&#1501; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;   ); and both &#1493;&#1499;&#1497; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-19.htm">Isaiah 36:19</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-20.htm">Isaiah 36:20</a>, introduce an exclamatory clause when following a negative interrogatory sentence: and that they should have saved," or "that Jehovah should save," equivalent to "how much less have they saved, or will He save" (Ewald, 354, c; comp. &#1488;&#1507;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-15.htm">2 Chronicles 32:15</a>). Rabshakeh's words in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-18.htm">Isaiah 36:18-20</a> are the same as those in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-8.htm">Isaiah 10:8-11</a>. The manner in which he defies the gods of the heathen, of Samaria, and last of all of Jerusalem, corresponds to the prophecy there. It is the prophet himself who acts as historian here, and describes the fulfilment of the prophecy, though without therefore doing violence to his character as a prophet. </body></html>
