Chariots were commonly used, as cavalry was, in plains. But it is probable that Lebanon was accessible by chariots drawn by horses.<p>To the sides of Lebanon - On the situation of Lebanon see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-34.htm">Isaiah 10:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-17.htm">Isaiah 29:17</a>. Sennacherib is represented as having carried desolation to Lebanon, and as having cut down its stately trees (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-9.htm">Isaiah 33:9</a>).<p>I will cut down the tall cedars thereof - Margin, 'The tallness of the cedars thereof.' The boast of Sennacherib was that he would strip it of its beauty and ornament; that is, that he would lay the land waste.<p>And the choice fir-trees thereof - (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-8.htm">Isaiah 14:8</a>). The Septuagint renders it, &#x3a5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  Uparissou - 'The beauty of the cypress.' The word here denotes the cypress, a tree resembling the white cedar. It grew on Lebanon, and, together with the cedar, constituted its glory. Its wood, like that of the cedar, was employed for the floors and ceilings of the temple <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-10.htm">1 Kings 5:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-15.htm">1 Kings 6:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-34.htm">1 Kings 6:34</a>.

In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-23.htm">2 Kings 19:23</a>, it is, 'I will enter the lodgings of his borders;' perhaps referring to the fact that on the ascent to the top of the mountain there was a place for the repose of travelers; a species of inn or caravansera which bounded the usual attempts of persons to ascend the mountain. Such a lodging-place on the sides or tops of mountains which are frequently ascended, is not uncommon.<p>And the forest his Carmel - On the meaning of the word Carmel, see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-17.htm">Isaiah 29:17</a>. Here it means, as in that passage, a rich, fertile, and beautiful country. It is known that Lebanon was covered on the top, and far down the sides, with perpetual snow. But there was a region lying on its sides, between the snow and the base of the mountain, that was distinguished for fertility, and that was highly cultivated. This region produced grapes in abundance; and this cultivated part of the mountain, thick set with vines and trees, might be called a beautiful grove. This was doubtless the portion of Lebanon which is here intended. At a distance, this tract on the sides of Lebanon appeared doubtless as a thicket of shrubs and trees. The phrase 'garden-forest,' will probably express the sense of the passage. 'After leaving Baalbec, and approaching Lebanon, towering walnut trees, either singly or in groups, and a rich carpet of verdure, the offspring of numerous streams, give to this charming district the air of an English park, majestically bordered with snow-tipped mountains. At Deir-el-Akmaar, the ascent begins winding among dwarf oaks, hawthorns, and a great variety of shrubs and flowers. A deep bed of snow had now to be crossed, and the horses sunk or slipped at every moment. To ride was impracticable, and to walk dangerous, for the melting snow penetrated our boots, and our feet were nearly frozen. An hour and a half brought us to the cedars.'

The king of Assyria is represented as boasting of the ease with which he triumphs over all natural obstacles in the pursuance of his plans; such language is blasphemy against Jehovah, the Lord of Nature; although the king himself may be hardly conscious of the sin he is committing. The tenses in the speech might all be made perfects by a change of vowels, or they may all be rendered by presents; the king’s meaning being simply that he constantly performs such impossibilities as these. The Assyrian parallels cited by Cheyne are very striking (see his <span class="ital">Commentary</span>, p. 219 and the references there).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-15.htm">Isaiah 36:15-20</a>). And hast said. Sennacherib had not actually uttered these words with his mouth; but the prophet clothes in his own highly poetic language the thoughts which the Assyrian king had cherished in his heart. He had regarded "the multitude of his chariots" as irresistible; he had considered that the mountains which guarded Palestine would be no obstacle to his advance; he had contemplated ravaging and despoiling of its timber the entire country; he had meant to penetrate into every region that was lovely and fertile. The emphatic "I" of the original <span class="accented">- ani -</span> twice repeated, marks the proud egotism of the monarch. <span class="cmt_word">By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains</span>; rather, <span class="accented">with the multitude</span>; or, according to another reading, <span class="accented">with chariots upon chariots.</span> The Assyrian kings contrived to cross with their chariots mountain chains of great difficulty, and frequently boast of the achievement. Tiglath-Pileser I. says, "I assembled my chariots and warriors. I betook myself to carts of iron in order to overcome the rough mountains and their difficult marches. I made the wilderness thus practicable for the passage of my chariots and warriors" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. pp. 9, 10). Asshur-izir-pal, "The rugged hill country, unfitted for the passage of chariots and armies, with instruments of iron I cut through, and with metal rollers I beat down the chariots and troops I brought over" (ibid., vol. 3. p. 58). Shalmaneser II., "Trackless paths, difficult mountains, which like the point of an iron sword stood pointed to the sky, on wheels of iron and bronze I penetrated. My chariots and armies I transported over them" (ibid., p. 85). In the less rough parts, while the warders dismounted, tire horses drew the chariots, which were assisted over obstacles by attendants ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 74); but, in regions of greater difficulty, they were conveyed across the mountain ranges in waggons of rude and strong construction ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. p. 13) The chariot-force was regarded as so important that the Assyrians never made any distant expedition without it. <span class="cmt_word">To the sides of Lebanon</span>. It was not necessary to cross either Libanus or Anti-Libanus in order to invade Judaea, <span class="accented">since</span> the natural route was along the Coele-Syrian valley and across the spurs of Hermon to the Jordan; but an Assyrian army was intent on plunder and devastation, no less than upon conquest, and would ascend mountain regions that did not lie on its direct line of march for either or both of these objects. It was customary for the soldiers to cut clown the tall cedars and choice fir trees of Lebanon on their Syrian campaigns, in order to transport the timber to Nineveh and other great cities, where it was used for building (see the comment on Isaiah 14:8, and compare Layard, 'Nineveh and <span class="accented">Babylon</span>,' pp. 356, 357, and 'Records of the Past,' vol. 3. pp. 40, 47, 83, 90; vol. 5. p. 119; vol. 9. p. 16, etc.). It was also customary to destroy the trees in an enemy's country, simply in order to inflict injury upon the foe ('Ancient Monarchies.' vol. 2. p. 84). <span class="cmt_word">I will enter into the height of his border</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I will enter into its uttermost height</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I will penetrate through the entire mountain region of Palestine, called roughly "Lebanon," to the furthest height of any importance - that on which Jerusalem stood - and thus occupy the whole land. The parallel passage of 2 Kings has "lodging" for "height," in apparent allusion to the palace of Hezekiah. And the forest of his Carmel; or, <span class="accented">the forest of its pleasure-garden</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the rich plantation tracts, covered with vines, olives, and fig trees, which formed the special glory of Judaea (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-16.htm">Isaiah 36:16, 17</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/37.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This intimidating message, which declared the God of Israel to be utterly powerless, was conveyed by the messengers of Sennacherib in the form of a latter. "And Hizkiyahu took the letter out of the hand of the messengers, and read it (K. read them), and went up to the house of Jehovah; and Hizkiyahu spread it before Jehovah." Sepha&#770;r&#305;&#772;m (the sheets) is equivalent to the letter (not a letter in duplo), like literae (cf., grammata). &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; (changed by K. into m- ') is construed according to the singular idea. Thenius regards this spreading out of the letter as a naivet&#1497;; and Gesenius even goes so far as to speak of the praying machines of the Buddhists. But it was simply prayer without words - an act of prayer, which afterwards passed into vocal prayer. "And Hizkiyahu prayed to (K. before) Jehovah, saying (K. and said), Jehovah of hosts (K. omits tsebha&#770;'o&#772;th), God of Israel, enthroned upon the cherubim, Thou, yea Thou alone, art God of all the kingdoms of the earth; Thou, Thou hast made the heavens and the earth. Incline Thine ear, Jehovah, and hear &#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, various reading in both texts &#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;)! Open Thine eyes (K. with Yod of the plural), Jehovah, and see; and hear the (K. all the) words of Sennacherib, which he hath sent (K. with which he hath sent him, i.e., Rabshakeh) to despise the living God! Truly, O Jehovah, the kings of Asshur have laid waste all lands, and their land (K. the nations and their land), and have put (vena&#770;tho&#772;n, K. vena&#770;thenu&#772;) their gods into the fire: for they were not gods, only the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them. And now, Jehovah our God, help us (K. adds pray) out of his hand, and all the kingdoms of the earth may know that Thou Jehovah (K. Jehovah Elohim) art it alone." On &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; (no doubt the same word as &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c2;, though not fabulous beings like these, but a symbolical representation of heavenly beings), see my Genesis, p. 626; and on yo&#772;she&#772;bh hakkerubh&#305;&#772;m (enthroned on the cherubim), see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-2.htm">Psalm 80:2</a>. &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; in &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1470;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; is an emphatic repetition, that is to say a strengthening, of the subject, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-12.htm">Isaiah 51:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-28.htm">2 Samuel 7:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-12.htm">Jeremiah 49:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-5.htm">Psalm 44:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-6.htm">Nehemiah 9:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-11.htm">Ezra 5:11</a> : tu ille (not tu es ille, Ges. 121, 2)  equals  tu, nullus alius. Such passages as <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-4.htm">Isaiah 41:4</a>, where &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; is the predicate, do not belong here. &#1506;&#1497;&#1503; is not a singular (like &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/32-8.htm">Psalm 32:8</a>, where the lxx have &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;), but a defective plural, as we should expect after pa&#770;qach. On the other hand, the reading shela&#770;cho&#772; ("hath sent him"), which cannot refer to debha&#770;r&#305;&#772;m (the words), but only to the person bringing the written message, is to be rejected. Moreover, Knobel cannot help giving up his preference for the reading vena&#770;tho&#772;n (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-43.htm">Genesis 41:43</a>; Ges. 131, 4a); just as, on the other hand, we cannot help regarding the reading &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; as a mistake, when compared with the reading of the book of Kings. Abravanel explains the passage thus: "The Assyrians have devastated the lands, and their own land" (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-20.htm">Isaiah 14:20</a>), of which we may find examples in the list of victories given above; compare also Beth-arbel in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a>, if this is Irbil on the Tigris, from which Alexander's second battle in Persia, which was really fought at Gaugamela, derived its name. But how does this tally with the fact that they threw the gods of these lands - that is to say, of their own land also (for &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; could not possibly refer to &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;, to the exclusion of &#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1501;) - into the fire? If we read haggo&#772;y&#305;&#772;m (the nations), we get rid both of the reference to their own land, which is certainly purposeless here, and also of the otherwise inevitable conclusion that they burned the gods of their own country. The reading &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; appears to have arisen from the fact, that after the verb &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; the lands appeared to follow more naturally as the object, than the tribes themselves (compare, however, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-12.htm">Isaiah 60:12</a>). The train of thought is the following: The Assyrians have certainly destroyed nations and their gods, because these gods were nothing but the works of men: do Thou then help us, O Jehovah, that the world may see that Thou alone art it, viz., God ('Elo&#772;h&#305;&#772;m, as K. adds, although, according to the accents, Jehovah Elohim are connected together, as in the books of Samuel and Chronicles, and very frequently in the mouth of David: see Symbolae in Psalmos, pp. 15, 16). </body></html>
