Month by month, for three whole years, he was seen in the streets of Jerusalem as one who was already as a prisoner of war, ready to be led into an ignominious exile.

He commonly wore sackcloth as a prophet, to show himself mortified to the world. He was to loose this from his loins; to wear no upper garments, and to go barefooted. This sign was to signify, that the Egyptians and Ethiopians should be led away captives by the king of Assyria, thus stripped. The world will often deem believers foolish, when singular in obedience to God. But the Lord will support his servants under the most trying effects of their obedience; and what they are called upon to suffer for his sake, commonly is light, compared with what numbers groan under from year to year from sin. Those who make any creature their expectation and glory, and so put it in the place of God, will, sooner or later, be ashamed of it. But disappointment in creature-confidences, instead of driving us to despair, should drive us to God, and our expectation shall not be in vain. The same lesson is in force now; and where shall we look for aid in the hour of necessity, but to the Lord our Righteousness, throne of grace, and serving with each other in the same business of religion, should end all disputes, and unite the hearts of believers to each other in holy love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>By Isaiah - Margin, 'By the hand of Isaiah.' So the Hebrew. That is, by the instrumentality of Isaiah. He sent him to make known the fate of the Egyptians, and the folly of trusting in them on this occasion.<p>Go, and loose the sackcloth - For the meaning of the word "sackcloth," see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-24.htm">Isaiah 3:24</a>. It was commonly worn as an emblem of mourning. But there is reason to believe that it was worn also by the prophets, and was regarded, in some degree, as their appropriate dress. It was made usually of the coarse hair of the goat, and was worn as a zone or girdle around the loins. That this was the dress of Elijah is apparent from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8</a> : 'He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather;' that is, he was clothed in a garment made of hair. The same was true of John the Baptist <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>. That the prophets wore 'a rough garment' is apparent also from <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-4.htm">Zechariah 13:4</a> : 'Neither shall they (the false prophets) wear a rough garment (Hebrew, A garment of hair) to deceive;' that is, the false prophets shall not assume the dress of the true prophets for the purpose of deluding the people, or to make them think that they are true prophets. It is evident, therefore, that this hairy garment was regarded as a dress that pertained particularly to the prophets. It is well known, also, that the ancient Greek philosophers had a special dress to distinguish them from the common people. Probably the custom of wearing "hair cloth" among the monks of later ages took its rise from this example of the prophets. His removing this garment was designed to be a sign or an emblem to show that the Egyptians should be stripped of all their possessions, and carried captive to Assyria.<p>Walking naked - That is, walking "without this special prophetic garment. It does not mean that he was in a state of entire nudity, for all that he was directed to do was to lay this garment - this emblem of his office - aside. The word "naked," moreover, is used in the Scriptures, not to denote an absolute destitution of clothing, but that the "outer" garment was laid aside (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-7.htm">John 21:7</a>). Thus it is said of Saul <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-24.htm">1 Samuel 19:24</a> that he 'stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day;' that is, he stripped off his royal robes, and was "naked or unclothed" in that respect. He removed his "special" dress as a king, or military chieftain, and appeared in the ordinary dress. It cannot be supposed that the king of Israel would be seen literally without raiment. So David is said to have danced "naked" before the ark, that is, with his royal robes laid aside. How "long" Isaiah walked in this manner has been a matter of doubt (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3</a>). The prophets were accustomed to use symbolic actions to denote the events which they foretold (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-18.htm">Isaiah 8:18</a>). Thus the children of Isaiah, and the names given to them, were significant of important events (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1-3</a>; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-1.htm">Jeremiah 18:1-6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-8.htm">Jeremiah 43:8-9</a>); in both of which places he used emblematic actions to exhibit the events concerning which he prophesied in a striking manner. Thus also the prophets are expressly called 'signs and wonders' <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-6.htm">Ezekiel 12:6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. by&#8212;literally, "by the hand of" (compare Eze 3:14).<p>sackcloth&#8212;the loose outer garment of coarse dark hair-cloth worn by mourners (2Sa 3:31) and by prophets, fastened at the waist by a girdle (Mt 3:4; 2Ki 1:8; Zec 13:4).<p>naked&#8212;rather, "uncovered"; he merely put off the outer sackcloth, retaining still the tunic or inner vest (1Sa 19:24; Am 2:16; Joh 21:7); an emblem to show that Egypt should be stripped of its possessions; the very dress of Isaiah was a silent exhortation to repentance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Loose the sackcloth; </span> ungird it and put it off; the antecedent put for the consequent, which is very usual, as hath been often noted.

It is rather surprising to find that Isaiah wore this distinctive badge of his profession. He is directed to “ungird” (and lay aside) this and walk “naked,” i.e. in his under-garment (the <span class="ital">kuttôneth</span>), cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-24.htm" title="And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night.

By the accents the words “three years” are attached to this clause in order to convey the sense “a three-years’ sign,” meaning “a sign of an event which is to happen after three years.” But this is very unnatural, and was evidently suggested by a desire to avoid the notion that the action was kept up for so long a time.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia</span>] Ethiopia was at this time the paramount influence in the Nile-valley, Upper Egypt being completely under its sway, while Lower Egypt was divided amongst a number of petty princes.

And Jehovah smites Egypt, smiting and healing; and if they return to Jehovah, He suffers Himself to be entreated, and heals them." From that small commencement of five cities, and a solitary altar, and one solitary obelisk, it has now come to this: Jehovah extends the knowledge of Himself to the whole of Egypt &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;, reflective se cognoscendum dare, or neuter innotescere), and throughout all Egypt there arises the knowledge of God, which soon shows itself in acts of worship. This worship is represented by the prophet, just as we should expect according to the Old Testament view, as consisting in the offering of bleeding and bloodless, or legal and free-will offerings: &#1493;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, viz., &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, so that &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; is construed with a double accusative, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-26.htm">Exodus 10:26</a>, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-29.htm">Genesis 30:29</a>; or it may possibly be used directly in the sense of sacrificing, as in the Phoenician, and like &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; in the Thorah; and even if we took it in this sense, it would yield no evidence against Isaiah's authorship (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-21.htm">Isaiah 28:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-17.htm">Isaiah 32:17</a>). Egypt, though converted, is still sinful; but Jehovah smites it, "smiting and healing" (na&#770;goph vera&#770;pho', compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-37.htm">1 Kings 20:37</a>), so that in the act of smiting the intention of healing prevails; and healing follows the smiting, since the chastisement of Jehovah leads it to repentance. Thus Egypt is now under the same plan of salvation as Israel (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-44.htm">Leviticus 26:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a>). </body></html>
