It is good to apply to ourselves what the Scripture says of the vanity and vexation of spirit which attend all things here below. Sin has turned the earth upside down; the earth is become quite different to man, from what it was when God first made it to be his habitation. It is, at the best, like a flower, which withers in the hands of those that please themselves with it, and lay it in their bosoms. The world we live in is a world of disappointment, a vale of tears; the children of men in it are but of few days, and full of trouble, See the power of God's curse, how it makes all empty, and lays waste all ranks and conditions. Sin brings these calamities upon the earth; it is polluted by the sins of men, therefore it is made desolate by God's judgments. Carnal joy will soon be at end, and the end of it is heaviness. God has many ways to imbitter wine and strong drink to those who love them; distemper of body, anguish of mind, and the ruin of the estate, will make strong drink bitter, and the delights of sense tasteless. Let men learn to mourn for sin, and rejoice in God; then no man, no event, can take their joy from them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The new wine languisheth - The new wine (&#1514;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;  t&#305;&#770;yro&#770;sh), denotes properly must, or wine that was newly expressed from the grape, and that was not fermented, usually translated 'new wine,' or 'sweet wine.' The expression here is poetic. The wine languishes or mourns because there are none to drink it; it is represented as grieved because it does not perform its usual office of exhilarating the heart, and the figure is thus an image of the desolation of the land.<p>The vine languisheth - It is sickly and unfruitful, because there are none to cultivate it as formerly. The idea is, that all nature sympathizes in the general calamity.<p>All the merry-hearted - Probably the reference is mainly to those who were once made happy at the plenteous feast, and at the splendid entertainments where wine abounded. They look now upon the widespread desolation of the land, and mourn. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. mourneth&#8212;because there are none to drink it [Barnes].

Even when the joyous time of the vintage comes round, the earth is still sad, cannot shake off its depression or wake up to merriment.

"Behold, Jehovah emptieth the earth, and layeth it waste, and marreth its form, and scattereth its inhabitants. And it happeneth, as to the people, so to the priest; as to the servant, so to his master; as to the maid, so to her mistress; as to the buyer, so to the seller; as to the lender, so to the borrower; as to the creditor, so to the debtor. Emptying the earth is emptied, and plundering is plundered: for Jehovah hat spoken this word." The question, whether the prophet is speaking of a past of future judgment, which is one of importance to the interpretation of the whole, is answered by the fact that with Isaiah "hinne&#772;h" (behold) always refers to something future (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>, etc.). And it is only in his case, that we do meet with prophecies commencing so immediately with hinne&#772;h. Those in Jeremiah which approach this the most nearly (viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-2.htm">Jeremiah 47:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-35.htm">Jeremiah 49:35</a>, cf., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-1.htm">Isaiah 51:1</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>) do indeed commence with hinne&#772;h, but not without being preceded by an introductory formula. The opening "behold" corresponds to the confirmatory "for Jehovah hath spoken," which is always employed by Isaiah at the close of statements with regard to the future and occurs chiefly,<p>(Note: Vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-20.htm">Isaiah 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-17.htm">Isaiah 21:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-25.htm">Isaiah 22:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-5.htm">Isaiah 40:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-14.htm">Isaiah 58:14</a>; also compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-4.htm">Isaiah 19:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-13.htm">Isaiah 16:13</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-22.htm">Isaiah 37:22</a>.)<p>though not exclusively,<p>(Note: Vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-18.htm">Obadiah 1:18</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/3-8.htm">Joel 3:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-11.htm">1 Kings 14:11</a>.)<p>in the book of Isaiah, whom we may recognise in the detailed description in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-2.htm">Isaiah 24:2</a> (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12-16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-2.htm">Isaiah 3:2-3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-18.htm">Isaiah 3:18-23</a>, as compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-13.htm">Isaiah 9:13</a>; also with the description of judgment in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-2.htm">Isaiah 19:2-4</a>, which closes in a similar manner). Thus at the very outset we meet with Isaiah's peculiarities; and Caspari is right in saying that no prophecy could possibly commence with more of the characteristics of Isaiah than the prophecy before us. The play upon words commences at the very outset. Ba&#770;kak and ba&#770;lak (compare the Arabic ballu&#772;ka, a blank, naked desert) have the same ring, just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/2-11.htm">Nahum 2:11</a>, cf., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-3.htm">Isaiah 24:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-2.htm">Jeremiah 51:2</a>. The niphal futures are intentionally written like verbs Pe-Va&#770;v (tibbo&#772;k and tibbo&#772;z, instead of tibbak and tibbaz), for the purpose of making them rhyme with the infinitive absolutes (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a>). So, again, caggebirta&#770;h is so written instead of cigbirta&#770;h, to produce a greater resemblance to the opening syllable of the other words. The form &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; is interchanged with &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;) (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>), or, according to Kimchi's way of writing it, with &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;) (written with tzere), just as in other passages we meet with &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; along with &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, and, judging from Arab. ns', to postpone or credit, the former is the primary form. No&#772;sheh is the creditor, and &#1489;&#1493; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is not the person who has borrowed of him, but, as &#1504;&#1513;&#1492; invariably signifies to credit (hiphil, to give credit), the person whom he credits (with &#1489; obj., like &#1489;&#1468; &#1504;&#1490;&#1513;&#1474; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a>), not "the person through whom he is &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;)" (Hitzig on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-10.htm">Jeremiah 15:10</a>). Hence, "lender and borrower, creditor and debtor" (or taker of credit). It is a judgment which embraces all, without distinction of rank and condition; and it is a universal one, not merely throughout the whole of the land of Israel (as even Drechsler renders &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;), but in all the earth; for as Arndt correctly observes, &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; signifies "the earth" in this passage, including, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>, the ethical New Testament idea of "the world" (kosmos). </body></html>
