It is good to apply to ourselves what the Scripture says of the vanity and vexation of spirit which attend all things here below. Sin has turned the earth upside down; the earth is become quite different to man, from what it was when God first made it to be his habitation. It is, at the best, like a flower, which withers in the hands of those that please themselves with it, and lay it in their bosoms. The world we live in is a world of disappointment, a vale of tears; the children of men in it are but of few days, and full of trouble, See the power of God's curse, how it makes all empty, and lays waste all ranks and conditions. Sin brings these calamities upon the earth; it is polluted by the sins of men, therefore it is made desolate by God's judgments. Carnal joy will soon be at end, and the end of it is heaviness. God has many ways to imbitter wine and strong drink to those who love them; distemper of body, anguish of mind, and the ruin of the estate, will make strong drink bitter, and the delights of sense tasteless. Let men learn to mourn for sin, and rejoice in God; then no man, no event, can take their joy from them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof - The statements in this verse are given as a reason why the curse had been pronounced against them, and why these calamities had come upon them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-6.htm">Isaiah 24:6</a>. The first reason is, that the very earth become polluted by their crimes. This phrase may denote that injustice and cruelty prevailed to such an extent that the very earth was stained with gore, and covered with blood under the guilty population. So the phrase is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-33.htm">Numbers 33:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-38.htm">Psalm 106:38</a>. Or it may mean in general that the wickedness of the people was great, and was accumulating, and the very earth under them was polluted by sustaining such a population. But the former is probably the correct interpretation.<p>Changed the ordinance - Or, the statute (&#1495;&#1511;  cho&#770;q). This word, from &#1495;&#1511;&#1511;  cha&#770;qaq, to engrave, and then to make or institute a law or an ordinance, is usually applied to the positive statutes appointed by Moses. The word statute accurately expresses the idea. These they had changed by introducing new statutes, and had in fact, if not in form, repealed the laws of Moses, and introduced others.<p>Broken the everlasting covenant - The word 'covenant' here is evidently used, as it is often, in the sense of law. By the term 'everlasting covenant,' Vitringa correctly supposes is denoted the laws of nature, the immutable laws of justice and right, which are engraven on the conscience, and which are inflexible and perpetual. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. earth&#8212;rather, "the land."<p>defiled under &#8230; inhabitants&#8212;namely, with innocent blood (Ge 4:11; Nu 35:33; Ps 106:38).<p>laws &#8230; ordinance &#8230; everlasting covenant&#8212;The moral laws, positive statutes, and national covenant designed to be for ever between God and them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The earth also, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">And the land</span>; or, <span class="ital">this land</span>; for here is an emphatical article in the Hebrew text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; </span> by the wickedness of its people; of which see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-25.htm" title="And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof on it, and the land itself vomits out her inhabitants.">Leviticus 18:25</a>,27 Num 35:33</span>, &c. <span class="ital">The laws</span>; the laws of God revealed to them, and pressed upon them in a singular manner, called simply the laws, as the word of God is ofttimes called the word, by way of eminency. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The ordinance; </span> God’s ordinances concerning his worship and service; the singular being put collectively for the plural. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The everlasting covenant; </span> the covenant made between God and Abraham, and all his posterity, renewed with the Israelites at Sinai, which was everlasting, both on God’s part, who, upon the conditions therein expressed, engaged himself to be a God to them and to their seed for ever; and on Israel’s part, who were obliged thereby to constant and perpetual obedience through all generations.

Hitherto the prophet has been concerned with the mere fact of a terrible judgment to be sent by God upon the whole world. Now he sets forth the cause of the fact. It is the old cause, which has reduced so many lauds to desolation, and which in the far-off times produced the Flood, viz. the wickedness of man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5-13</a>). The earth is "defiled" or "polluted" by the sins of its inhabitants, and has to be purged from the defilement by suffering. <span class="cmt_word">They have transgressed the laws</span>. Apart from both Judaism and Christianity, all mankind have been placed by God under a double law: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The "law written in their hearts" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-15.htm">Romans 2:15</a>), which speaks to them through their consciences, and lays them under an obligation that cannot be gainsaid. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The law of positive commands, given to the entire human race through the common progenitors, Adam and Noah, which is obligatory upon all to whom it has been traditionally handed down; but which has been only very partially handed down, and it is not generally felt as obligatory. Mankind has in all ages largely transgressed both laws, and both would seem to be pointed at in the present passage. The transgression of the "law written in the heart" is doubtless that which especially calls down God's vengeance, and makes him from time to time execute wrath on the whole world. Changed the ordinance; rather, <span class="accented">broken</span>, <span class="accented">violated</span>. Transgression in act is intended, not formal abrogation of the Divine ordinances. Broken the everlasting covenant. Mr. Cheyne supposes an allusion to the covenant made with Noah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-16.htm">Genesis 9:16</a>); but it seems better to understand that "everlasting covenant" which exists between God and man, in virtue of the nature wherewith God has endowed man, and of the laws which he Ires impressed upon man's con. science.

"And it will come to pass at the end of the seventy years: Jehovah will visit Tzor, and she comes again to her hire, and commits prostitution with all the kingdoms of the earth on the broad surface of the globe." Such mercantile trading as hers, which is only bent upon earthly advantages, is called za&#770;na&#770;h, on account of its recognising none of the limits opposed by God, and making itself common to all the world, partly because it is a prostitution of the soul, and partly because from the very earliest times the prostitution of the body was also a common thing in markets and fairs, more especially in those of Phoenicia (as the Phoenicians were worshippers of Astarte). Hence the gain acquired by commerce, which Tyre had now secured again, is called 'ethna&#770;n (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-19.htm">Deuteronomy 23:19</a>), with a feminine suffix, according to the Masora without mappik (Ewald, 247, a). </body></html>
