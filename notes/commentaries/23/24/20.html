(Comp. the like illustration of a ship tossed by the waves in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-27.htm" title="They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end.">Psalm 107:27</a>.) The second becomes clearer if we render <span class= "ital">hammock </span>instead of cottage, a hanging mat, suspended from a tree, in which the keeper of the vineyard slept, moving with every breath of wind; the very type of instability. In the words that follow the prophet traces the destruction to its source. The physical catastrophe is not the result of merely physical causes. The earth totters under the weight of its iniquity, and falls (we must remember the Hebrew idea of the world as resting upon pillars, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-8.htm" title="He raises up the poor out of the dust, and lifts up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and he has set the world on them.">1Samuel 2:8</a>), never to rise again. In its vision of the last things the picture finds a parallel, though under different imagery, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/3-10.htm" title="But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.">2Peter 3:10-13</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:16-23 Believers may be driven into the uttermost parts of the earth; but they are singing, not sighing. Here is terror to sinners; the prophet laments the miseries he saw breaking in like a torrent; and the small number of believers. He foresees that sin would abound. The meaning is plain, that evil pursues sinners. Unsteady, uncertain are all these things. Worldly men think to dwell in the earth as in a palace, as in a castle; but it shall be removed like a cottage, like a lodge put up for the night. It shall fall and not rise again; but there shall be new heavens and a new earth, in which shall dwell nothing but righteousness. Sin is a burden to the whole creation; it is a heavy burden, under which it groans now, and will sink at last. The high ones, that are puffed up with their grandeur, that think themselves out of the reach of danger, God will visit for their pride and cruelty. Let us judge nothing before the time, though some shall be visited. None in this world should be secure, though their condition be ever so prosperous; nor need any despair, though their condition be ever so deplorable. God will be glorified in all this. But the mystery of Providence is not yet finished. The ruin of the Redeemer's enemies must make way for his kingdom, and then the Sun of Righteousness will appear in full glory. Happy are those who take warning by the sentence against others; every impenitent sinner will sink under his transgression, and rise no more, while believers enjoy everlasting bliss.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard - This is descriptive of the agitation that occurs in an earthquake when everything is shaken from its foundation, and when trees and towers are shaken by the mighty concussion. The same figure is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-9.htm">Isaiah 29:9</a>. See also the description of a tempest at sea, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-27.htm">Psalm 107:27</a> :<p>They reel to and fro,<p>And stagger like a drunken man,<p>And are at their wit's end.<p>And shall be removed like a cottage - Or rather, shall move or vacillate (&#1492;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1491;&#1491;&#1492;  hiteno&#770;deda&#770;h) like a cottage. The word "cottage" (&#1502;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;  melu&#770;na&#770;h from &#1500;&#1497;&#1503;  l&#305;&#770;yn, "to pass the night, to lodge for a night") means properly a temporary shed or lodge for the watchman of a garden or vineyard (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>). Sometimes these cottages were erected in the form of a hut; and sometimes they were a species of hanging bed or couch, that was suspended from the limbs of trees. They were made either by interweaving the limbs of a tree, or by suspending them by cords from the branches of trees, or by extending a cord or cords from one tree to another, and laying a couch or bed on the cords. They were thus made to afford a convenient place for observation, and also to afford security from the access of wild beasts. Travelers in the East even now resort to such a temporary lodge for security (see Niebuhr's Description of Arabia). These lodges were easily moved to and fro, and swung about by the wind - and this is the idea in the verse before us. The whole land was agitated as with an earthquake; it reeled like a drunkard; it moved, and was unsettled, as the hanging couch on the trees was driven to and fro by the wind.<p>And the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it - Like a vast incumbent weight on a dwelling which it cannot sustain, and beneath which it is crushed.<p>And it shall fall, and not rise again - This does not mean, as I apprehend, that the nation should never be restored to its former dignity and rank as a people, for the prophet immediately <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a> speaks of such a restoration, and of the re-establishment of the theocracy; but it must mean that in those convulsions it would not rise. It would not be able to recover itself; it would certainly be prostrated. As we say of a drunkard, he may stumble often, and partially recover himself, yet he will certainly fall so as not then to be able to recover himself, so it would be with that agitated and convulsed land. They would make many efforts to recover themselves, and they would partially succeed, yet they would ultimately be completely prostrate in the dust. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. removed like a cottage&#8212;(See on [734]Isa 1:8).

"They will lift up their voice, and exult; for the majesty of Jehovah they shout from the sea: therefore praise ye Jehovah in the lands of the sun, in the islands of the sea the name of Jehovah the God of Israel." The ground and subject of the rejoicing is "the majesty of Jehovah," i.e., the fact that Jehovah had shown Himself so majestic in judgment and mercy (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-5.htm">Isaiah 12:5-6</a>), and was now so manifest in His glory (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-17.htm">Isaiah 2:17</a>). Therefore rejoicing was heard "from the sea" (the Mediterranean), by which the abode of the congregation of Jehovah was washed. Turning in that direction, it had the islands and coast lands of the European West in front (iyyi hayya&#770;m; the only other passage in which this occurs is <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a>, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-18.htm">Ezekiel 26:18</a>), and at its back the lands of the Asiatic East, which are called 'urim, the lands of light, i.e., of the sun-rising. This is the true meaning of 'urim, as J. Schelling and Drechsler agree; for Dderlein's comparison of the rare Arabic word awr, septentrio is as far removed from the Hebrew usage as that of the Talmud &#1488;&#1493;&#1512; &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;, vespera.

His "name" (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>) is His nature as revealed and made "nameable" in judgment and mercy. </body></html>
