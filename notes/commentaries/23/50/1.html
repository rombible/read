And because God foresaw that this strange dispensation would provoke the Jews to murmur and quarrel with him for casting them off without sufficient cause, as indeed they were always prone to accuse him, and vindicate themselves, he bids them produce their bill of divorce. For those husbands who put away their wives out of levity or passion were obliged to give them a bill of divorce, which vindicated the wives’ innocence, and declared that the husband’s will and pleasure was the cause of their dismission. Now, says God, produce your bill of divorce, to show that I have put you away of my own mere will, and on a slight occasion, and that you did not first forsake me and go after other gods, and by that spiritual adultery violate the marriage covenant into which I had taken you. <span class="ital">Or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you </span>— Have I any creditors to whom I was obliged or willing to sell you for the payment of a debt?

Here is an answer for such murmurings; God never deprived any of their advantages, except for their sins. The Jews were sent into Babylon for their idolatry, a sin which broke the covenant; and they were at last rejected for crucifying the Lord of glory. God called on them to leave their sins, and prevent their own ruin. Last of all, the Son came to his own, but his own received him not. When God calls men to happiness, and they will not answer, they are justly left to be miserable. To silence doubts concerning his power, proofs of it are given. The wonders which attended his sufferings and death, proclaimed that he was the Son of God, Mt 27:54.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/50.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thus saith the Lord - To the Jews in Babylon, who were suffering under his hand, and who might be disposed to complain that God had dealt with them with as much caprice and cruelty as a man did with his wife, when he gave her a writing of divorce, and put her away without any just cause.<p>Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement? - God here speaks of himself as the husband of his people, as having married the church to himself, denoting the tender affection which he had for his people. This figure is frequently used in the Bible. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-5.htm">Isaiah 62:5</a> : 'As the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee;' 'For thy Maker is thy husband' <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>; 'Turn, O backsliding children, saith the Lord, for I am married unto you' <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-14.htm">Jeremiah 3:14</a>. Thus in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a>, the church is called 'the bride, the Lamb's wife.' Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>:See Lowth on Hebrew poetry, Lec. xxxi. The phrase, 'bill of divorcement.' refers to the writing or instrument which a husband was by law obliged to give a wife when he chose to put her away. This custom of divorce Moses found probably in existence among the Jews, and also in surrounding nations, and as it was difficult if not impossible at once to remove it, he permitted it on account of the hardness of the hearts of the Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-8.htm">Matthew 19:8</a>).<p>It originated probably from the erroneous views which then prevailed of the nature of the marriage compact. It was extensively regarded as substantially like any other compact, in which the wife became a purchase from her father, and of course as she had been purchased, the husband claimed the right of dismissing her when he pleased. Moses nowhere defines the causes for which a man might put away his wife, but left these to be judged of by the people themselves. But he regulated the way in which it might be done. He ordained a law which was designed to operate as a material check on the hasty feelings, the caprice, and the passions of the husband. He designed that it should be with him, if exercised, not a matter of mere excited feeling, but that he should take time to deliberate upon it; and hence, he ordained that in all cases a formal instrument of writing should be executed releasing the wife from the marriage tie, and leaving her at liberty to pursue her own inclinations in regard to future marriages <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-2.htm">Deuteronomy 24:2</a>.<p>It is evident that this would operate very materially in favor of the wife, and in checking and restraining the excited passions of the husband (see Jahn's Bib. Antiq. Section 160; Michaelis' Commentary on the Laws of Moses, vol. i. pp. 450-478; ii.-127-40. Ed. Lond. 1814, 8vo.) In the passage before us, God says that he had not rejected his people. He had not been governed by the caprice, sudden passion, or cruelty which husbands often evinced. There was a just cause why he had treated them as he had, and he did not regard them as the children of a divorced wife. The phrase, 'your mother,' Here is used to denote the ancestry from whom they were descended. They were not regarded as the children of a disgraced mother.<p>Or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you - Among the Hebrews, a father had the right, by the law of Moses, if he was oppressed with debt, to sell his children <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-7.htm">Exodus 21:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-5.htm">Nehemiah 5:5</a>. In like manner, if a man had stolen anything, and had nothing to make restitution, he might be sold for the theft <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-3.htm">Exodus 22:3</a>. If a man also was poor and unable to pay his debts, he might be sold <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-25.htm">Matthew 18:25</a>. On the subject of slavery among the Hebrews, and the Mosaic laws in regard to it, see Michaelis' Commentary on the Laws of Moses, vol. ii. pp. 155, following In this passage, God says that he had not been governed by any such motives in his dealings with his people. He had not dealt with them as a poor parent sometimes felt himself under a necessity of doing, when he sold his children, or as a creditor did when a man was not able to pay him. He had been governed by different motives, and he had punished them only on account of their transgressions.<p>Ye have sold yourselves - That is, you have gone into captivity only on account of your sins.

The Judgments on Israel Were Provoked by Their Crimes, yet They Are Not Finally Cast Off by God.<p>1. Where &#8230; mothers divorcement&#8212;Zion is "the mother"; the Jews are the children; and God the Husband and Father (Isa 54:5; 62:5; Jer 3:14). Gesenius thinks that God means by the question to deny that He had given "a bill of divorcement" to her, as was often done on slight pretexts by a husband (De 24:1), or that He had "sold" His and her "children," as a poor parent sometimes did (Ex 21:7; 2Ki 4:1; Ne 5:5) under pressure of his "creditors"; that it was they who sold themselves through their own sins. Maurer explains, "Show the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom &#8230; ; produce the creditors to whom ye have been sold; so it will be seen that it was not from any caprice of Mine, but through your own fault, your mother has been put away, and you sold" (Isa 52:3). Horsley best explains (as the antithesis between "I" and "yourselves" shows, though Lowth translates, "Ye are sold") I have never given your mother a regular bill of divorcement; I have merely "put her away" for a time, and can, therefore, by right as her husband still take her back on her submission; I have not made you, the children, over to any "creditor" to satisfy a debt; I therefore still have the right of a father over you, and can take you back on repentance, though as rebellious children you have sold yourselves to sin and its penalty (1Ki 21:25).<p>bill &#8230; whom&#8212;rather, "the bill with which I have put her away" [Maurer].The dereliction of the Jews is not of Christ; for he hath power to save, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/50-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother's divorce, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you?

Here begins a new discourse or prophecy, and therefore thus prefaced, and is continued in the following chapter: <p>where is the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have put away? these words are directed to the Jews, who stood in the same relation to the Jewish church, or synagogue, as children to a mother; and so the Targum interprets "your mother" by "your congregation", or synagogue; who were rejected from being a church and people; had a "loammi" written upon them, which became very manifest when their city and temple were destroyed by the Romans; and this is signified by a divorce, alluding to the law of divorce among the Jews, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>, when a man put away his wife, he gave her a bill of divorce, assigning the causes of his putting her away. Now, the Lord, either as denying that he had put away their mother, the Jewish church, she having departed from him herself, and therefore challenges them to produce any such bill; a bill of divorce being always put into the woman's hands, and so capable of being produced by her; or if there was such an one, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-8.htm">Jeremiah 3:8</a>, he requires it might be looked into, and seen whether the fault was his, or the cause in themselves, which latter would appear: <p>or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? referring to a practice used, that when men were in debt, and could not pay their debts, they sold their children for the payment of them; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-7.htm">Exodus 21:7</a>, but this could not be the case here; the Lord has no creditors, not any to whom he is indebted, nor could any advantage possibly accrue to him by the sale of them; it is true they were sold to the Romans, or delivered into their hands, which, though a loss to them, was no gain to him; nor was it he that sold them, but they themselves; he was not the cause of it, but their own sins, as follows: <p>behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves; or, "are sold" (w); they were sold for them, or delivered up into the hands of their enemies on account of them; they had sold themselves to work wickedness, and therefore it was but just that they should be sold, and become slaves: <p>and for your transgressions is your mother put away; and they her children along with her, out of their own land, and from being the church and people of God. <p>(w)  Sept.

No such document exists. Although Jehovah has had good reason to adopt this extreme measure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-8.htm" title="And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.">Jeremiah 3:8</a>), He has not done it, but has left the way open for a reconciliation. The effect of the “bill of divorcement” was to make the separation absolute and final; the woman was free to marry another, but could not after that be received back by her former husband (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/24-1.htm" title="When a man has taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes, because he has found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house....">Deuteronomy 24:1-4</a>). (A specimen of the form of words used by later Jews is given in Dalman’s <span class="ital">Aramäische Dialektproben</span>, p. 5.) In Mohammedan law a man may divorce his wife twice and take her back without any ceremony, but a third divorce (or a triple divorce conveyed in one sentence) is final, <span class="ital">unless</span> the woman have contracted a fresh marriage in the interval and been released from it either by divorce or the death of the husband (<span class="ital">Koran</span>, Sura 2:229 f.; see Lane, <span class="ital">Modern Egyptians</span>, chap. 3). Both the Mosaic and the Mohammedan laws accord to a husband the unrestricted right of divorce, and for this reason the Jewish custom was pronounced by our Lord to be inconsistent with the true idea of marriage and a concession to the weakness of human nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-3.htm" title="The Pharisees also came to him, tempting him, and saying to him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?">Matthew 19:3</a> ff.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-2.htm" title="And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.">Mark 10:2</a> ff.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which of my creditors</span> is it &c.] i.e. “what creditor of mine is there to whom” &c.?

They are not sold - he has "taken no money for them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-12.htm">Psalm 44:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-3.htm">Isaiah 52:3</a>); and the Babylonians are thus not their rightful owners (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-24.htm">Isaiah 49:24</a>) - they are still God's children, his property, and the objects of his care. <span class="cmt_word">For your iniquities...  for your</span> <span class="cmt_word">transgressions;</span> rather, <span class="accented">by your iniquities</span>...  <span class="accented">by your transgressions.</span> The separation, such as it was, between God and his people was caused by their sins, not by any act of his. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/49.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The words that sound in the ears of Zion are now followed by the thought of astonishment and surprise, that rises up in her heart. "And thou wilt say in thy heart, Who hath borne me these, seeing I was robbed of children, and barren, banished, and thrust away; and these, who hath brought them up? Behold, I was left alone; these, where were they?" She sees herself suddenly surrounded by a great multitude of children, and yet she was robbed of children, and galmu&#772;da&#770;h (lit. hard, stony, Arab. 'galmad, 'gulmu&#772;d, e.g., es-sachr el'gulmu&#772;d, the hardest stone, mostly as a sugstantive, stone or rock, from ga&#770;lam, from which comes the Syriac gelomo, stony ground, related to cha&#770;lam, whence challa&#770;m&#305;&#772;sh, gravel, root gal, gam, to press together, or heap up in a lump or mass), i.e., one who seemed utterly incapacitated for bearing children any more. She therefore asks, Who hath borne me these (not, who hath begotten, and which is an absurd question)? She cannot believe that they are the children of her body, and her children's children. As a tree, whose foliage is all faded away, is called no&#772;bheleth itself in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-30.htm">Isaiah 1:30</a>, so she calls herself go&#772;la&#770;h vesu&#772;ra&#770;h, extorris et remota (su&#772;r  equals  mu&#772;sa&#770;r, like su&#772;g in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-14.htm">Proverbs 14:14</a>  equals  na&#770;so&#772;g or mussa&#770;g), because her children have been carried away into exile. In the second question, the thought has dawned upon her mind, that those by whom she finds herself surrounded are her own children; but as she was left alone, whilst they went forth, as she thought to die in a foreign land, she cannot comprehend where they have been hitherto concealed, or where they have grown up into so numerous a people. </body></html>
