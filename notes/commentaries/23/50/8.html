While the former ones sounded plaintive like soft flute music, this rings out clear like the note of a trumpet summoning to battle. The Servant of the Lord seems here to be eager for the conflict, not merely patient and enduring, not merely setting His face like a flint, but confidently challenging His adversaries, and daring them to the strife.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> As for the form of the words, the image underlying the whole is that of a suit at law. It is noteworthy that since <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-1.htm" title="Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew their strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us come near together to judgment.">Isaiah 41:1</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-29.htm" title="Behold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing: their molten images are wind and confusion.">Isaiah 41:29</a> this metaphor has run through the whole prophecy. The great controversy is God <span class="ital">versus</span> Idols. God appears at the bar of men, pleads His cause, calls His witnesses {<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-9.htm" title="Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and show us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.">Isaiah 43:9</a>}. ‘Let them’ {<span class="ital">i.e.</span> idols} ‘bring forth their witnesses that they may be justified.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Possibly the form of the words here is owing to the dominance of that idea in the context, and implies nothing more than the general notion of opposition and victory. But it is at least worth remembering that in the life of Christ we have many instances in which the prophetic images were literally fulfilled even though their meaning was mainly symbolical: as <span class="ital">e.g.</span> the riding on the ass, the birth in Bethlehem, the silence before accusers, ‘a bone of Him shall not be broken,’ and in this very contest, ‘shame and spitting.’ So here there may be included a reference to that time when the hatred of opposition reached its highest point-in the sufferings and death of our Lord. And it is at least a remarkable coincidence that that highest point was reached in formal trials before the ecclesiastical and civil authorities, for the purpose of convicting Him, and that these processes as legal procedures broke down so signally.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Keeping up the metaphor, we mark here-<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. Messiah’s lofty challenge to His accusers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The ‘justifying’ which He expects may refer either to personal character or to official functional faithfulness. I think it refers to both, and that we have here, expressed in prophetic outline, not only the fact of Christ’s sinlessness, but the fact of His consciousness of sinlessness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The words are the strongest assertion of His absolute freedom from anything that an adversary could lay hold of on which to found a charge, and not merely so, but they also dare to assert that the unerring and all-penetrating eye of the Judge of all will look into His heart, and find nothing there but the mirrored image of His own perfection. I do not need to dwell on the fact of Christ’s sinlessness, that He is perfect manhood without stain, without defect. I have had occasion to touch upon that truth in a former sermon on ‘I was not rebellious.’ Here we have to do not so much with sinlessness as with the consciousness of sinlessness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now note that consciousness on Christ’s part.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We have to reckon with the fact of it as expressed in His own words: ‘I do always the things that please Him. Which of you convinceth Me of sin?’ ‘The Prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in Me.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> In Him there is the absence of all trace of sense of sin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> No prayer for forgiveness comes from His lips.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> No penitence, no acknowledgment of even weakness is heard from Him. Even in His baptism, which for others was an acknowledgment of impurity, He puts His submission to the rite, not on the ground of needing to be washed from sin, but of ‘fulfilling all righteousness.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now, unless Christ was sinless, what do we say of these assertions? ‘If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us’-are we to apply that canon to Him when He stands before us and asks, ‘Which of you convinceth Me of sin?’ Surely it augurs small self-knowledge or a low moral standard if, from the lips of a religious teacher, there never comes one word to indicate that he has felt the hold of evil on him. I make bold to say that if Christ were not sinless, the Apostle Paul stood far above Him, with his ‘of whom I am chief.’ What difference would there be between Him and the Pharisees who called forth His bitterest words by this very absence in them of consciousness of sin: ‘If ye were blind ye would have no sin, but now ye say, We see, therefore your sin remaineth.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Singularly enough the world has accepted Him at His own estimate, and has felt that these lofty assertions of absolute perfection were borne out by His life, and were consistent with the utmost lowliness of heart.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> As to the adversary’s failure, I need only recall the close of His life, which is representative of the whole impression made on the world by Him. What a wonderful and singular concurrence of testimonies was borne to His pure and blameless life! After months of hatred and watching, even the rulers’ lynx-eyed jealousy found nothing, and they had to fall back upon false witnesses. ‘Hearest thou not how many things they witness against Thee?’ He stood with unmoved silence, and the lies fell down dead at His feet. Had He answered, they would have been preserved and owed their immortality to the Gospels: He held His peace and they vanished. All attempts failed so signally that at the last they were fain, in well-simulated holy abhorrence, to base His condemnation on what He had said in their presence. ‘How think ye, ye have heard the blasphemy?’ So all that the adversary, raking through a life, could find, was that one word. That was His sin; in all else He was pure. Remember Pilate’s acquittal: ‘I find no fault in Him,’ and his wife’s warning, ‘Have thou nothing to do with that just Person.’ Think of Judas, ‘I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood.’ Listen to the penitent thief’s low voice gasping out in his pangs and almost collapse: ‘This man hath done nothing amiss.’ Listen to the Centurion telling the impression made even on his rough nature: ‘Truly this was a righteous Man.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> These are the answers to the Servant’s challenge, wrung from the lips of His adversaries; and they but represent the universal judgment of humanity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There is one Man whose life has been without stain or spot, whose soul has never been crossed by a breath of passion, nor dimmed by a speck of sin, whose will has ever been filled with happy obedience, whose conscience has been undulled by evil and untaught to speak in condemnation, whose whole nature has been like some fair marble, pure in hue, perfect in form, and unstained to the very core. There is one Man who can front the most hostile scrutiny with the bold challenge, ‘Which of you convinceth Me of sin?’ and His very haters have to answer, ‘I find no fault in Him,’ while those that love Him rejoice to proclaim Him ‘holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners.’ There is one Man who can front the most rigid Law of Duty and say, ‘I came not to destroy but to fulfil,’ and the stony tables seem to glow with tender light, as of rocky cliffs in morning sunshine, attesting that He has indeed fulfilled all righteousness. There is one Man who can stand before God without repentance or confession, and whose claim ‘I do always the things that please Him,’ the awful voice from the opening heavens endorses, when it proclaims; ‘This is My beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.’ The lowly Servant of God flings out His challenge to the universe: ‘Who will contend with Me?’ and that gage has lain in the lists for nineteen centuries unlifted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The Messiah’s expectation of divine vindication and acquittal.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Like many another man, Christ had to strengthen Himself against calumny and slander by turning to God, and finding comfort in the belief that there was One who would do Him right, and as throughout this context we have had the true humanity of our Lord in great prominence, it is worth while to dwell for a moment on that thought of His real sharing in the pain of misconstruction and groundless charges, and of His too having to say, as we have so often to say, ‘Well, there is one who knows. Men may condemn but God will acquit.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But there is something more than that here. The divine vindication and acquittal is not a mere hidden thought and judgment in the mind of God. It is a declaring and showing to be innocent, and that not by word but by deed. That expectation seemed to be annihilated and made ludicrous by His death. But the ‘justifying’ of which our text speaks takes place in Christ’s resurrection and ascension.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘Manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit’ {<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1 Timothy 3:16</a>}. ‘Declared to be the Son of God with power, . . . by the resurrection from the dead’ {<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm" title="And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:">Romans 1:4</a>}.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> His death seems the entire abandonment of this holy and sinless man. It seems to demonstrate His claims to be madness, His hope to be futile, His promises to be wind. No wonder that the sorrowing apostles wailed, ‘We trusted that it had been He who should have redeemed Israel.’ The death of Christ, if it were but a martyr’s death, and if we had to believe that that frame had crumbled into dust, and that heart ceased for ever to beat, would not only destroy the worth of all that He spoke, but would be the saddest instance in all history of the irreversible sway that death wields over all mankind, and would deepen the darkness and sadden the gloom of the grave. True, there were not wanting even in His dying hours mysterious indications, such as His promise to the penitent thief. But these only make the disappointment the deeper, if there was nothing more after His death.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> So Christ’s justification is in His resurrection and ascension.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The Messiah’s confidence of ultimate triumph.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>In the last words of the text the adversaries are massed together. The confidence that the Lord God will help and justify leads to the conviction that all opposition to Him is futile and leads to destruction.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We see the historical fulfilment in the fate of the nation. ‘His blood be upon us and upon our children.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We have a truth applying universally that antagonism to Him is self-destructive.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Two forms of destruction are here named. There is a slow decay going on in the opponents and their opposition, as a garment waxing old, and there is a being fretted away by the imperceptible working of external causes, as by gnawing moths.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Applied to persons. To opposing systems.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> How many antagonists the Gospel has had, and one after another has been antiquated, and their books are only known because fragments of them are preserved in Christian writings. Paganism is gone from Europe, and its idols are in our museums. Each generation has its own phase of opposition, which lasts for a little while. The mists round the sun melt, the clouds piled in the north, surging up to bury it beneath their banks, are dissipated. The sea roars and smashes on the cliffs, but it ebbs and calms. Some of us have seen more than one school of thought which came to the assault of Christianity, with colours flying and drums rattling, defeated utterly and forgotten, and so it will always be. One may be sure that each enemy in turn will descend to the oblivion that has already received so many, and can imagine these beaten foes rising from their seats to welcome the newcomer with the sad greeting: ‘Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We are ‘justified’ in His ‘justification.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The real connection between us and Christ by faith, makes our justification to be involved in His, so that it is no mere accommodation but a profound perception of the real relation between Christ and us, when Paul, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-34.htm" title="Who is he that comdemns? It is Christ that died, yes rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.">Romans 8:34</a>, triumphantly claims the words of our text for Christ’s disciples, and rings out their challenge on behalf of all believers: ‘It is God that justifieth, who is he that condemneth?’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Do you trust in Christ? Then you too can dare to say: ‘The Lord God will help me; who is he that shall condemn me?’<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/50.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>50:4-9 As Jesus was God and man in one person, we find him sometimes speaking, or spoken of, as the Lord God; at other times, as man and the servant of Jehovah. He was to declare the truths which comfort the broken, contrite heart, those weary of sin, harassed with afflictions. And as the Holy Spirit was upon him, that he might speak as never man spake; so the same Divine influence daily wakened him to pray, to preach the gospel, and to receive and deliver the whole will of the Father. The Father justified the Son when he accepted the satisfaction he made for the sin of man. Christ speaks in the name of all believers. Who dares to be an enemy to those unto whom he is a Friend? or who will contend with those whom he is an Advocate? Thus St. Paul applies it, Ro 8:33.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/50.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He is near that justifieth me - That is, God, who will vindicate my character, and who approves what I do, does not leave nor forsake me, and I can with confidence commit myself and my cause to him (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-4.htm">Isaiah 49:4</a>). The word justify here is not used in the sense in which it is often in the Scriptures, to denote the act by which a sinner is justified before God, but in the proper, judicial sense, that he would declare him to be righteous; he would vindicate his character, and show him to be innocent. This was done by all the testimonies of God in his favor - by the voice which spake from heaven at his baptism - by the miracles which he performed, showing that he was commissioned and approved by God - by the fact that even Pilate was constrained to declare him innocent - by the wonders that attended his crucifixion, showing that 'he was a righteous man,' even in the view of the Roman centurion <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-47.htm">Luke 23:47</a>, and by the fact that he was raised from the dead, and was taken to heaven, and placed at the right hand of the Father - thus showing that his whole work was approved by God, and furnishing the most ample vindication of his character from all the accusations of his foes.<p>Who will contend with me? - This question indicates confidence in God, and in the integrity of his own character.

The Hebrew is 'Lord (&#1489;&#1506;&#1500;  ba&#8219;al) of judgment.' The expression means not merely one who has a lawsuit, or a cause, but one who is 'lord of the judgment,' i. e, possessor of the cause, or one who has a claim, and can demand that the judgment should be in his favor. And the call here is on any who should have such a claim to prefer against the Messiah; who should have any real ground of accusation against him; that is, it is an assertion of innocence.<p>Let him come near to me - Let him come and make his charges, and enter on the trial. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/50.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

This sin brought upon Zion and her children the judgment of banishment, and it was this which made it last so long. "Why did I come, and there was no one there? Why did I call, and there was no one who answered? Is my hand too short to redeem? or is there no strength in me to deliver? Behold, through my threatening I dry up the sea; turn streams into a plain: their fish rot, because there is no water, and die for thirst. I clothe the heavens in mourning, and make sackcloth their covering." Jehovah has come, and with what? It follows, from the fact of His bidding them consider, that His hand is not too short to set Israel loose and at liberty, that He is not so powerless as to be unable to draw it out; that He is the Almighty, who by His mere threatening word (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-9.htm">Psalm 106:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-7.htm">Psalm 104:7</a>) can dry up the sea, and turn streams into a hard and barren soil, so that the fishes putrefy for want of water (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-18.htm">Exodus 7:18</a>, etc.), and die from thirst (tha&#770;mo&#772;th a voluntative used as an indicative, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-1.htm">Isaiah 12:1</a>, and very frequently in poetical composition); who can clothe the heavens in mourning, and make sackcloth their (dull, dark) covering (for the expression itself, compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-1.htm">Isaiah 37:1-2</a>); who therefore, fiat applicatio, can annihilate the girdle of waters behind which Babylon fancies herself concealed (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-15.htm">Isaiah 42:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-27.htm">Isaiah 44:27</a>), and cover the empire, which is now enslaving and torturing Israel, with a sunless and starless night of destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>). It follows from all this, that He has come with a gospel of deliverance from sin and punishment; but Israel has given no answer, has not received this message of salvation with faith, since faith is assent to the word of God. And in whom did Jehovah come? Knobel and most of the commentators reply, "in His prophets." This answer is not wrong, but it does not suffice to show the connection between what follows and what goes before. For there it is one person who speaks; and who is that, but the servant of Jehovah, who is introduced in these prophecies with dramatic directness, as speaking in his own name? Jehovah has come to His people in His servant. We know who was the servant of Jehovah in the historical fulfilment. It was He whom even the New Testament Scriptures describe as &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b4;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, especially in the Acts (<a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-13.htm">Acts 3:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-26.htm">Acts 3:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-30.htm">Acts 4:30</a>). It was not indeed during the Babylonian captivity that the servant of Jehovah appeared in Israel with the gospel of redemption; but, as we shall never be tired of repeating, this is the human element in these prophecies, that they regard the appearance of the "servant of Jehovah," the Saviour of Israel and the heathen, as connected with the captivity: the punishment of Israel terminating, according to the law of the perspective foreshortening of prophetic vision, with the termination of the captivity - a connection which we regard as one of the strongest confirmations of the composition of these addresses before the captivity, as well as of Isaiah's authorship. But this &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; does not destroy the &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; in them, inasmuch as the time at which Jesus appeared was not only similar to that of the Babylonian captivity, but stood in a causal connection with it, since the Roman empire was the continuation of the Babylonian, and the moral state of the people under the iron arm of the Roman rule resembled that of the Babylonian exiles (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-6.htm">Ezekiel 2:6-7</a>). At the same time, whatever our opinion on this point may be, it is perfectly certain that it is to the servant of Jehovah, who was seen by the prophet in connection with the Babylonian captivity, that the words "wherefore did I come" refer. </body></html>
