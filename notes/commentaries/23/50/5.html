The Servant continues his soliloquy. What has come to him in the morning communings with God is, as in the next verse, that he too is to bear reproach and shame, as other disciples had done before him. The writer of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-7.htm" title="All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,">Psalm 22:7</a>, the much-enduring Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-10.htm" title="They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.">Job 30:10</a>), the prophet Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-7.htm" title="O LORD, you have deceived me, and I was deceived; you are stronger than I, and have prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocks me.">Jeremiah 20:7</a>), were but foreshadowings of the sufferings that should fall on him. And all this the true Servant-Scholar accepts willingly. because it is his Father’s will. Here again we cannot fail to trace the influence of Isaiah’s words in all our Lord’s utterances as to His passion. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-21.htm" title="From that time forth began Jesus to show to his disciples, how that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.">Matthew 16:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-34.htm" title="And they shall mock him, and shall whip him, and shall spit on him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.">Mark 10:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-32.htm" title="For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:">Luke 18:32</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/isaiah/50.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Isaiah<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE SERVANT’S OBEDIENCE<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-5.htm" title="The Lord GOD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.">Isaiah 50:5</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The secret of Christ’s life, filial obedience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The fact is attested by Scripture. By His own words: ‘My meat is to do the will of My Father’; ‘For thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness’; ‘I came down from heaven not to do My own will.’ By His servant’s words: ‘Obedient unto death’; ‘Made under the law’; ‘He learned obedience by the things which He suffered.’ It is involved in the belief of His righteous manhood. It is essential to true manhood. The highest ideal for humanity is conscious dependence on God, and the very definition of righteousness is conscious conformity to the Will of God. If Christ had done the noblest acts and yet had not always had this sense of being a servant, He would not have been pure and holy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It is not inconsistent with His true Divinity. We stand afar off, but we can see this much.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The completeness of that obedience. It was continuous and it was entire.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The living heart of it: ‘I delight to do Thy Will.’ The Father’s Will was not a force without, but Christ’s whole being was conformed to it, and it was shrined within His heart and had become His choice and delight.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The expressions of His obedience were His perfect fulfilment of the divine commands, and His perfect endurance of the divine appointments.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Thus God’s Will was the keynote, to which Christ’s will struck the full chord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The yet deeper mysteries which that perfect obedience discloses.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. A sinless human life must be more than human. The contrast with all which we have known-the impossibility of retaining belief in the perfect obedience of Jesus unless we have underlying it the belief in His divinity. ‘There is none good but one, that is God.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. The sinless human life suffers not for itself but for us. The combination of holiness and sorrow leads on to the mystery of atonement. The sinlessness is indispensable to the doctrine of His sacrificial death.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The glorious gifts which flow from that perfect obedience.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. It gives us a living law to obey.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. It gives us a transforming power to receive.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. It gives us a perfect righteousness to trust to.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> This perfect obedience may be ours. Being ours, our lives will be strong, free, peaceful.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> That obedience becomes ours by faith, which leads to love, and love to the glad obedience of sons.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/50.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/50-5.htm" title="The Lord GOD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back....">Isaiah 50:5-6</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Lord hath opened mine ear — </span>Hath given me a power and will to hear and receive his commands. <span class="ital">And I was not rebellious </span>— I readily did and suffered what he required of me. <span class="ital">Neither turned away back</span> — From hearing or obeying his will, how difficult or dangerous soever the work might be to which he called me.

All these things were literally fulfilled in Christ, as is expressly affirmed in the gospels; but we read of no such things concerning Isaiah, and therefore it is most safe and reasonable to understand this passage of Christ, and the rather, because it is not usual with the prophets to commend themselves so highly as the prophet here commends the person of whom he speaks.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/50.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>50:4-9 As Jesus was God and man in one person, we find him sometimes speaking, or spoken of, as the Lord God; at other times, as man and the servant of Jehovah. He was to declare the truths which comfort the broken, contrite heart, those weary of sin, harassed with afflictions. And as the Holy Spirit was upon him, that he might speak as never man spake; so the same Divine influence daily wakened him to pray, to preach the gospel, and to receive and deliver the whole will of the Father. The Father justified the Son when he accepted the satisfaction he made for the sin of man. Christ speaks in the name of all believers. Who dares to be an enemy to those unto whom he is a Friend? or who will contend with those whom he is an Advocate?

They "did not hear; their ear was <span class="accented">not</span> opened; they were treacherous and rebellious from the womb" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-8.htm">Isaiah 48:8</a>). His ear was opened to receive God's word perpetually; he was not rebellious, did not turn away back. Even when most tried, his final word was, "Not my will, but thine, be done" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/49.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There follows now a sceptical question prompted by weakness of faith; and the divine reply. The question, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-24.htm">Isaiah 49:24</a> : "Can the booty indeed be wrested from a giant, or will the captive host of the righteous escape?" The question is logically one, and only divided rhetorically into two (Ges. 153, 2). The giant, or gigantically strong one, is the Chaldean. Knobel, in opposition to Hitzig, who supposes the Persian to be referred to, points very properly to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-12.htm">Isaiah 51:12-13</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-5.htm">Isaiah 52:5</a>. He is mistaken, however, in thinking that we must read &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-24.htm">Isaiah 49:24</a>, as Ewald does after the Syriac and Jerome, on account of the parallelism. The exiles are called shebh&#305;&#772; tsadd&#305;&#772;q, not, however, as captives wrested from the righteous (the congregation of the righteous), as Meier thinks, taking tsadd&#305;&#772;q as the gen. obj.; still less as captives carried off by the righteous one, i.e., the Chaldean, for the Chaldean, even regarded as the accomplisher of the righteous judgment of God, is not tsadd&#305;&#772;q, but "wicked" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>); but merely as a host of captives consisting of righteous men (Hitzig). The divine answer, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-25.htm">Isaiah 49:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a> : "Yea, thus saith Jehovah, Even the captive hosts of a giant are wrested from him, and the booty of a tyrant escapes: and I will make war upon him that warreth with thee, and I will bring salvation to thy children. And I feed them that pain thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as if with new wine; and all flesh sees that I Jehovah am thy Saviour, and that thy Redeemer is the Mighty One of Jacob." We might take the k&#305;&#772; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-25.htm">Isaiah 49:25</a> as a simple affirmative, but it is really to be taken as preceded by a tacit intermediate thought. Rosenmller's explanation is the correct one: "that which is hardly credible shall take place, for thus hath Jehovah said." He has also given the true interpretation of gam: "although this really seems incredible, yet I will give it effect." Ewald, on the contrary, has quite missed the sense of <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-24.htm">Isaiah 49:24</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-25.htm">Isaiah 49:25</a>, which he gives as follows: "The booty in men which a hero has taken in war, may indeed be taken from him again; but Jehovah will never let the booty that He takes from the Chaldean (viz., Israel) be wrested from Him again." This is inadmissible, for the simple reason that it presupposes the emendation &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497; &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509; noita; and this 'a&#770;r&#305;&#772;ts is quite unsuitable, partly because it would be Jehovah to whom the case supposed referred, and still more, because the correspondence in character between <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-24.htm">Isaiah 49:24</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-14.htm">Isaiah 49:14</a> is thereby destroyed. The gibbo&#772;r and 'a&#770;r&#305;&#772;ts is called &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1498; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-25.htm">Isaiah 49:25</a>, with direct reference to Zion. This is a noun formed from the future, like Jareb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-6.htm">Hosea 10:6</a> - a name chosen as the distinctive epithet of the Asiatic emperor (probably a name signifying "king Fighting-cock"). The self-laceration threatened against the Chaldean empire recals to mind <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-19.htm">Isaiah 9:19-20</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-9.htm">Zechariah 11:9</a>, and has as revolting a sound as <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-24.htm">Numbers 23:24</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-15.htm">Zechariah 9:15</a> -passages which Daumer and Ghillany understand in the cannibal sense which they appear to have, whereas what they understand literally is merely a hyperbolical figure. Moreover, it must not be forgotten that the Old Testament church was a nation, and that the spirit of revelation in the Old Testament assumed the national form, which it afterwards shattered to pieces. Knobel points to the revolt of the Hyrcanians and several satraps, who fought on the side of Cyrus against their former rulers (Cyrop. iv 2, 6, v. 1-3). All this will be subservient to that salvation and redemption, which form the historical aim of Jehovah and the irresistible work of the Mighty One of Jacob. The name of God which we meet with here, viz., the Mighty One of Jacob, only occurs again in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>, and shows who is the author of the prophecy which is concluded here. The first half set forth, in the servant of Jehovah, the mediator of Israel's restoration and of the conversion of the heathen, and closed with an appeal to the heaven and the earth to rejoice with the ransomed church. The second half (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-14.htm">Isaiah 49:14-26</a>) rebukes the despondency of Zion, which fancies itself forgotten of Jehovah, by pointing to Jehovah's more than maternal love, and the superabundant blessing to be expected from Him. It also rebukes the doubts of Zion as to the possibility of such a redemption, by pointing to the faithfulness and omnipotence of the God of Israel, who will cause the exiles to be wrested from the Chaldean, and their tormentors to devour one another. The following chapter commences a fresh train of ideas. </body></html>
