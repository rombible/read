Here is an answer for such murmurings; God never deprived any of their advantages, except for their sins. The Jews were sent into Babylon for their idolatry, a sin which broke the covenant; and they were at last rejected for crucifying the Lord of glory. God called on them to leave their sins, and prevent their own ruin. Last of all, the Son came to his own, but his own received him not. When God calls men to happiness, and they will not answer, they are justly left to be miserable. To silence doubts concerning his power, proofs of it are given. The wonders which attended his sufferings and death, proclaimed that he was the Son of God, Mt 27:54.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/50.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I clothe the heavens with blackness - With the dark clouds of a tempest - perhaps with an allusion to the remarkable clouds and tempests that encircled the brow of Sinai when he gave the law. Or possibly alluding to the thick darkness which he brought over the land of Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21</a>; Grotius). In the previous verse, he had stated what he did on the earth, and referred to the exhibitions of his great power there. He here refers to the exhibition of his power in the sky; and the argument is, that he who had thus the power to spread darkness over the face of the sky, had power also to deliver his people.<p>I make sackcloth their covering - Alluding to the clouds. Sackcloth was a coarse and dark cloth which was usually worn as an emblem of mourning (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-24.htm">Isaiah 3:24</a>). The same image is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a> : 'And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair.' To say, therefore, that the heavens were clothed with sackcloth, is one of the most striking and impressive figures which can be conceived. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/50.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. heavens &#8230; blackness&#8212;another of the judgments on Egypt to be repeated hereafter on the last enemy of God's people (Ex 10:21).<p>sackcloth&#8212;(Re 6:12).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/50.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I clothe the heavens with blackness; </span> or, <span class="ital">I will or can clothe</span> &c.

With gross and thick darkness; perhaps referring to the three days' darkness the Egyptians were in, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-12.htm">Exodus 10:12</a>, or with thick and black clouds, as in tempestuous weather frequently; or by eclipses of the sun; there was an extraordinary instance of great darkness at the time of Christ's crucifixion, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-45.htm">Matthew 27:45</a>. <p>and I make sackcloth their covering; that being black, and used in times of mourning; the allusion may be to the tents of Kedar, which were covered with sackcloth, or such like black stuff. The fall of the Pagan empire, through the power of Christ and his Gospel, is signified by the sun becoming black as sackcloth of hair, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>. Jarchi interprets this parabolically of the princes of the nations, when the Lord shall come to take vengeance upon them; as Kimchi does the sea, and the rivers, in the preceding verse, of the good things of the nations of the world, which they had in great abundance, and should be destroyed. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/50.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> sackcloth their covering.</span><p>(f) As I did in Egypt in token of my displeasure, Ex 10:21.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/50.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>.

The word, which occurs only here, denotes (like sackcloth in the next clause) the garb of mourning.

The Egyptian plague of darkness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21-23</a>) is not adequate to the expressions here used. God means to assert his power of leaving all nature in absolute darkness, if he so choose - a power necessarily belonging to him who said, "Let there be light; and there was light" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I make sackcloth their covering</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>, "The sun became black as sackcloth of hair"). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/49.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Such affectionate treatment does the church receive, which is assembling once more upon its native soil, whilst kings and their consorts hasten to serve the re-assembled community. "And kings become thy foster-fathers, and their princesses they nurses: they bow down their face to thee to the earth, and they lick the dust of thy feet; and thou learnest that I am Jehovah, He whose hoping ones are not put to shame." As foster-fathers devote all their strength and care to those entrusted to them, and nurses nourish children from the very marrow of their own life, so will kings become the shelterers of Zion, and princesses the sustainers of her growth. All that is true in the regal headship of the church will be realized, and all that is false in regal territorialism will condemn itself: "vultu in terram demisso adorabunt te et pulverem pedum tuorum lingent" (Jerome). They do homage to the church, and kiss the ground upon which she stands and walks. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>, this adoration belongs to the God who is present in the church, and points the church itself away from all thought of her own merits to Jehovah, the God of salvation, cui qui confidunt non pudefient (&#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468; with an auxiliary pathach, like &#1497;&#1490;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-15.htm">Isaiah 47:15</a>; Ges. 65, 2: &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; with the first person made into a relative as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>; Ges. 123, 1, Anm. 1). Observe, however, that the state will not be swallowed up by the church - a thing which never will occur, and is never meant to occur; but by the state becoming serviceable to the church, there is realized a prelude of the perfected kingdom of God, in which the dualism of the state and the church is entirely abolished. </body></html>
