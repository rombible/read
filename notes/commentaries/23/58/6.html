These professors had shown sorrow on stated or occasioned fasts. But they indulged pride, covetousness, and malignant passions. To be liberal and merciful is more acceptable to God than mere fasting, which, without them, is vain and hypocritical. Many who seem humble in God's house, are hard at home, and harass their families. But no man's faith justifies, which does not work by love. Yet persons, families, neighbourhoods, churches, or nations, show repentance and sorrow for sin, by keeping a fast sincerely, and, from right motives, repenting, and doing good works. The heavy yoke of sin and oppression must be removed. As sin and sorrow dry the bones and weaken the strongest human constitution; so the duties of kindness and charity strengthen and refresh both body and mind. Those who do justly and love mercy, shall have the comfort, even in this world. Good works will bring the blessing of God, provided they are done from love to God and man, and wrought in the soul by the Holy Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/58.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Is not this the fast that I have chosen? - Fasting is right and proper; but that which God approves will prompt to, and will be followed by, deeds of justice, kindness, charity. The prophet proceeds to specify very particularly what God required, and when the observance of seasons of fasting would be acceptable to him.<p>To loose the bands of wickedness - This is the first thing to be done in order that their fasting might be acceptable to the Lord. The idea is, that they were to dissolve every tie which unjustly bound their fellowmen. The Chaldee renders it, 'Separate the congregation of impiety;' but the more probable sense is, that if they were exercising any unjust and cruel authority over others; if they had bound them in any way contrary to the laws of God and the interests of justice, they were to release them. This might refer to their compelling others to servitude more rigidly than the law of Moses allowed; or to holding them to contracts which had been fraudulently made; or to their exacting strict payment from persons wholly incapacitated to meet their obligations; or it might refer to their subjecting others to more rigid service than was allowed by the laws of Moses, but it would not require a very ardent imagination for anyone to see, that if he held slaves at all, that this came fairly under the description of the prophet. A man with a tender conscience who held slaves would have been likely to suppose that this part of the injunction applied to himself.<p>To undo the heavy burdens - Margin, 'Bundles of the yoke.' The Septuagint renders it, 'Dissolve the obligations of onerous contracts.' The Chaldee, 'Loose the obligations of the writings of unjust judgment.' The Hebrew means, 'Loose the bands of the yoke,' a figure taken from the yoke which was borne by oxen, and which seems to have been attached to the neck by cords or bands (see Fragments to Taylor's Calmer. No. xxviii.) The yoke, in the Scripture, is usually regarded as an emblem of oppression, or compulsory toil, and is undoubtedy so used here. The same word is used to denote 'burden' (&#1502;&#1493;&#1496;&#1492;  mo&#770;t&#803;a&#770;h), which in the subsequent member is rendered 'yoke,' and the word which is rendered 'undo (&#1492;&#1514;&#1512;  hat&#305;&#770;r from &#1504;&#1514;&#1497;  na&#772;tar), is elsewhere employed to denote emancipation from servitude. The phrase here employed would properly denote the release of captives or slaves, and would doubtless be so understood by those whom the prophet addressed. Thus, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/105-17.htm">Psalm 105:17-20</a> :<p>He sent a man before them, even Joseph,<p>Who was sold for a servant;<p>Whose feet they hurt with fetters;<p>He was laid in iron:<p>Until the time when his word came,<p>The word of the Lord tried him.<p>The king sent and loosed him (&#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;  vayt&#305;&#770;yre&#772;hu&#770;),<p>Even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.<p>And let the oppressed go free - Margin, 'Broken.' The Hebrew word &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;  retsu&#770;ts&#305;&#770;ym is from the word &#1512;&#1510;&#1509;  ra&#772;tsats, meaning "to break, to break down" (see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-3.htm">Isaiah 42:3</a>); to treat with violence, to oppress. It may be applied to those who are treated with violence in any way, or who are broken down by bard usage. It may refer, therefore, to slaves who are oppressed by bondage and toil; or to inferiors of any kind who are subjected to hard usage by those who are above them; or to the subjects of a tyrant groaning under his yoke. The use of the phrase here, 'go free,' however, seems to limit its application in this place to those who were held in bondage. Jerome renders it, 'Free those who are broken' (confracti). The Septuagint &#x3a4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  Tethrasmenos - 'Set at liberty those who are broken down.' If slavery existed at the time here referred to, this word would be appropriately understood as including that - at least would be so understood by the slaves themselves - for if any institution deserves to be called oppression, it is theft of slavery.<p>This interpretation would be confirmed by the use of the word rendered free. That word (&#1495;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;  chophsh&#305;&#770;ym) evidently refers to the act of freeing a slave. The person who had once been a slave, and who had afterward obtained his freedom, was denominated &#1495;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;  chophsh&#305;&#770;y (see Jahn, Bib. Ant. Section 171). This word occurs, and is so used, in the following places; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-12.htm">Exodus 21:12</a>, 'And the seventh (year) he shall go free;' <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-5.htm">Exodus 21:5</a>, 'I will not go out free;' <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/26-27.htm">Exodus 26:27</a>, 'He shall let him go free;' <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12</a>, 'Thou shalt let him go free;' <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-13.htm">Deuteronomy 15:13</a>, 'When thou sendest him out free' <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-18.htm">Deuteronomy 15:18</a>, 'When thou sendest him away free;' <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/3-19.htm">Job 3:19</a>, 'The servant is free from his master;' that is, in the grave, where there is universal emancipation. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-9.htm">Jeremiah 34:9-11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-14.htm">Jeremiah 34:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-16.htm">Jeremiah 34:16</a> where the same Hebrew word is used, and is applied expressly to the emancipation of slaves. The word is used in other places in the Bible except the following: <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-25.htm">1 Samuel 17:25</a>, 'And make his father's house free in Israel,' referring to the favor which was promised to the one who would slay Goliath of Gath. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-5.htm">Job 39:5</a> : 'Who hath sent out the wild donkey free?' <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-5.htm">Psalm 88:5</a> : 'Free among the dead.' The usage, therefore, is settled that the word properly refers to deliverance from servitude. It would be naturally understood by a Hebrew as referring to that, and unless there was something in the connection which made it necessary to adopt a different interpretation, a Hebrew would so understand it of course. In the case before us, such an interpretation would be obvious, and it is difficult to see how a Jew could understand this direction in any other way, if he was an owner. of slaves, than that be should set them at once at liberty.<p>And that ye break every yoke - A yoke, in the Scriptures, is a symbol of oppression, and the idea here is, that they were to cease all oppressions, and to restore all to their lust and equal rights. The prophet demanded, in order that there might be an acceptable 'fast,' that everything which could properly be described as a 'yoke' should be broken. How could this command be complied with by a Hebrew if he continued to retain his fellow-men in bondage? Would not its fair application be to lead him to emancipate those who were held as slaves? Could it be true, whatever else he might do, that he would fully comply with this injunction, unless this were done? If now this whole injunction were fairly complied with in his land, who can doubt that it would lead to the emancipation of the slaves? The language is such that it cannot well be misunderstood. The prophet undoubtedly specifies those things which properly denote slavery, and demands that they should all be abandoned in order to an acceptable 'fast to the Lord,' and the fair application of this injunction would soon extinguish slavery throughout the world. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/58.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. loose &#8230; bands of wickedness&#8212;that is, to dissolve every tie wherewith one has unjustly bound his fellow men (Le 25:49, &c.).

The words of God in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-19.htm">Isaiah 57:19</a> are introduced with an interpolated "inquit Jehova" (cf., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>, and the ellipsis in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-27.htm">Isaiah 41:27</a>); and what Jehovah effects by speaking thus is placed first in a determining participial clause: "Creating fruit (&#1504;&#1493;&#1489;  equals  &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, &#1504;&#1493;&#1489;, keri &#1504;&#1497;&#1489;) of the lips," &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; (lxx, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>), i.e., not of His own lips, to which &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488; would be inapplicable, but the offering of praise and thanksgiving springing from human lips (for the figure, see Psychol. p. 214, trans.; and on the root &#1504;&#1489;, to press upon forward): "Jehovah saith sha&#770;lo&#772;m, sha&#770;lo&#772;m," i.e., lasting and perfect peace (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>), "be the portion of those of my people who are scattered far and near" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-5.htm">Isaiah 43:5-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-12.htm">Isaiah 49:12</a>; compare the application to heathen and Jews in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>); "and I heal it" (viz., the nation, which, although scattered, is like one person in the sight of God). But the wicked, who persist in the alienation from God inherited from the fathers, are incapable of the peace which God brings to His people: they are like the sea in its tossed and stormy state (&#1504;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; pausal third pers. as an attributive clause). As this cannot rest, and as its waters cast out slime and mud, so has their natural state become one of perpetual disturbance, leading to the uninterrupted production of unclean and ungodly thoughts, words, and works. Thus, then, there is no peace for them, saith my God. With these words, which have even a more pathetic sound here than in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-22.htm">Isaiah 48:22</a>, the prophet seals the second book of his prophecies. The "wicked" referred to are not the heathen outside Israel, but the heathen, i.e., those estranged from God, within Israel itself. <p>The transition form the first to the second half of this closing prophecy is formed by &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-14.htm">Isaiah 57:14</a>. In the second half, from <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-11.htm">Isaiah 57:11</a>, we find the accustomed style of our prophet; but in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-9.htm">Isaiah 56:9-57:11</a>a the style is so thoroughly different, that Ewald maintains that the prophet has here inserted in his book a fragment from some earlier writer of the time of Manasseh. But we regard this as very improbable. It is not required by what is stated concerning the prophets and shepherds, for the book of Ezekiel clearly shows that the prophets and shepherds of the captivity were thus debased. Still less does what is stated concerning the early death of the righteous require it; for the fundamental idea of the suffering servant of Jehovah, which is peculiar to the second book, is shadowed forth therein. Nor by what is affirmed as to the idolatrous conduct of the people; for in the very centre (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-4.htm">Isaiah 57:4</a>) the great mass of the people are reproached for their contemptuous treatment of the servants of Jehovah. Nor does the language itself force us to any such conjecture, for <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1-12</a> also differs from the style met with elsewhere; and yet (although Ewald regards it as an earlier, borrowed fragment) it must be written by the author of the whole, since its grandest idea finds its fullest expression there. At the same time, we may assume that the prophet described the idolatry of the people under the influences of earlier models. If he had been a prophet of the captives after the time of Isaiah, he would have rested his prophecies on Jeremiah and Ezekiel. For just as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-18.htm">Isaiah 51:18</a>. has the ring of the Lamentations of Jeremiah, so does <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-3.htm">Isaiah 57:3</a>. resemble in many respects the earlier reproaches of Jeremiah (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-7.htm">Jeremiah 5:7-9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-29.htm">Jeremiah 5:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-8.htm">Jeremiah 9:8</a>, with the expression, "Should I rest satisfied with this?"); also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-25.htm">Jeremiah 2:25</a> (&#1504;&#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;), <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-13.htm">Jeremiah 3:13</a> ("upon lofty mountains and under green trees"); also the night scene in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23.htm">Ezekiel 23</a>. </body></html>
