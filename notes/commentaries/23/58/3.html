These professors had shown sorrow on stated or occasioned fasts. But they indulged pride, covetousness, and malignant passions. To be liberal and merciful is more acceptable to God than mere fasting, which, without them, is vain and hypocritical. Many who seem humble in God's house, are hard at home, and harass their families. But no man's faith justifies, which does not work by love. Yet persons, families, neighbourhoods, churches, or nations, show repentance and sorrow for sin, by keeping a fast sincerely, and, from right motives, repenting, and doing good works. The heavy yoke of sin and oppression must be removed. As sin and sorrow dry the bones and weaken the strongest human constitution; so the duties of kindness and charity strengthen and refresh both body and mind. Those who do justly and love mercy, shall have the comfort, even in this world. Good works will bring the blessing of God, provided they are done from love to God and man, and wrought in the soul by the Holy Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/58.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore have we fasted - They had fasted much, evidently with the expectation of delivering themselves from impending calamities, and securing the divine favor. They are here introduced as saying that they had been disappointed. God had not interposed as they had expected. Chagrined and mortified, they now complain that he had not noticed their very conscientious and faithful regard for the duties of religion.<p>And thou seest not? - All had been in vain. Calamities still impended; judgments threatened; and there were no tokens of the divine approbation. Hypocrites depend on their fastings and prayers as laying God under obligation to save them. If he does not interpose, they complain and murmur. When fasting is the result of a humble and broken heart, it is acceptable; when it is instituted as a means of purchasing the divine favor, and as laying God under obligation, it can be followed by no happy result to the soul.<p>Have we afflicted our soul - By fasting. Twenty-one manuscripts (six ancient), says Lowth, have this in the plural number - 'our souls' and so the Septuagint, Chaldee, and the Vulgate. The sense is not materially affected, however. It is evident here that they regarded their numerous fastings as laying the foundation of a claim on the favor of God, and that they were disposed to complain when that claim was not acknowledged. Fasting, like other religious duties, is proper; but in that, as in all other services of religion, there is danger of supposing that we bring God under obligations, and that we are laying the foundation of a claim to his favor.<p>Thou takest no knowledge - Thou dost not regard our numerous acts of self-denial.<p>Behold, in the day of your fast you find pleasure - The prophet here proceeds to state the reasons why their fastings were not succeeded as they supposed they would be, by the divine favor. The first reason which he states is, that even when they were fasting, they were giving full indulgence to their depraved appetites and lusts. The Syriac has well rendered this, 'In the day of your fasting you indulge your lusts, and draw near to all your idols.' This also was evidently the case with the Jews in the time of the Saviour. They were Characterized repeatedly by him as 'an evil and adulterous generation,' and yet no generation perhaps was ever more punctual and strict in the external duties of fasting and other religious ceremonies.<p>And exact all your labors - This is the second reason why their fasting was attended with no more happy results. The margin renders this 'griefs,' or things wherewith ye grieve others.' Lowth renders it, 'All your demands of labor ye rigorously exact.' Castellio renders it, 'And all things which are due to you, you exact.' The word rendered here 'labors' denotes usually hard and painful labor; toil, travail, etc. The Septuagint renders it here, 'And goad (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;  huponussete) all those who are under your control' (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;  tous hupocheirious humo&#772;n). The idea seems to be that they were at that time oppressive in exacting all that was due to them; they remitted nothing, they forgave nothing. Alas, how often is this still true! People may be most diligent in the external duties of religion; most abundant in fasting and in prayer, and at the same time most unyielding in demanding all that is due to them. Like Shylock - another Jew like those in the time of Isaiah - they may demand 'the pound of flesh,' at the same time that they may be most formal, punctual, precise, and bigoted in the performance of the external duties of religion. The sentiment taught here is, that if we desire to keep a fast that shall be acceptable to God, it must be such as shall cause us to unbind heavy burdens from the poor, and to lead us to relax the rigor of the claims which would be oppressive on those who are subject to us (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/58.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

The first half of the verse expresses the people’s sense of disappointment at the failure of their efforts to win the favour of Jehovah; the second half begins the prophet’s exposure of their hypocrisy. There is an incipient Pharisaism in their evident expectation that by external works of righteousness they would hasten the coming of the Messianic salvation. The prophet also maintains that salvation is conditioned by righteousness on the part of the people; but he insists that the righteousness which secures the fulfilment of the promises is ethical righteousness, not the mechanical observance of ceremonial forms.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">have we afflicted our soul</span>] see below on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-5.htm" title="Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? will you call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?">Isaiah 58:5</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">you find pleasure</span>] Rather <span class="bld">business</span> (see on ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm" title="That said of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, You shall be built; and to the temple, Your foundation shall be laid.">Isaiah 44:28</a>), i.e. “you find opportunity to do a profitable stroke of business.” Cf. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-13.htm" title="If you turn away your foot from the sabbath, from doing your pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honorable; and shall honor him, not doing your own ways, nor finding your own pleasure, nor speaking your own words:">Isaiah 58:13</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and exact all your labours</span>] Or, as R.V. marg., <span class="bld">and oppress all your labourers</span>.

Still, the lesson is general, and would apply to all occasions of fasting. The Jews of the time expected, it would seem, some special definite result, in the way of victory or relief, to follow from their observance of the Atonement fast. As it did not follow, they regarded themselves as ill used, and accordingly made complaint. Their feelings approached to those of the Vedic worshippers, who regarded their religious observances as "not merely pleasing. the god who was the object of them, but as laying him under a binding obligation, and almost compelling him to grant the requests of the worshipper" ('Religions of the Ancient World,' pp. 143, 144). Afflicted our soul These are the exact words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29, 31</a>, by which the fast of the great Day of Atonement was instituted. <span class="cmt_word">And thou takest no knowledge</span>; rather, <span class="accented">no notice. <span class="cmt_word"></span>In the day of your fast ye find pleasure</span>.

The future &#1493;&#1488;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, standing as it does by the side of the perfect here, indicates that which is also past; and &#1493;&#1488;&#1511;&#1510;&#1507; stands in the place of a second gerund: abscondendo (viz., pa&#770;nai, my face, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-8.htm">Isaiah 54:8</a>) et stomachando. When Jehovah had thus wrathfully hidden His gracious countenance from Israel, and withdrawn His gracious presence out of the midst of Israel (<a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/5-6.htm">Hosea 5:6</a>, &#1502;&#1492;&#1501; &#1495;&#1500;), it went away from Him (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489; with &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489;, like &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500; with &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;), going its own ways like the world of nations that had been left to themselves. But Jehovah had not seen these wanderings without pity. The futures which follow are promising, not by virtue of any syntactic necessity, but by virtue of an inward necessity. He will heal His wounded (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4-6</a>) and languishing people, and lead in the right way those that are going astray, and afford them consolation as a recompense for their long sufferings (&#1504;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is derived from the piel &#1504;&#1495;&#1501;, and not, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/11-8.htm">Hosea 11:8</a>, from the hiphal hinna&#770;che&#772;m, in the sense of "feelings of sympathy"), especially (Vav epexeget.; Ges. 155, 1) its mourning ones (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-2.htm">Isaiah 61:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-10.htm">Isaiah 66:10</a>), i.e., those who punishment has brought to repentance, and rendered desirous of salvation. </body></html>
