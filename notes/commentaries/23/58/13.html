We must turn from travelling on that day; from doing our pleasure on that holy day, without the control and restraint of conscience; or from indulging in the pleasures of sense. On sabbath days we must not follow our callings, or our pleasures. In all we say and do, we must put a difference between this day and other days. Even in Old Testament times the sabbath was called the Lord's day, and is fitly called so still; and for a further reason, it is the Lord Christ's day, Re 1:10. If we thus remember the sabbath day to keep it holy, we shall have the comfort and profit of it, and have reason to say, It is good to draw near to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/58.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath - The evident meaning of this is, that they were sacredly to observe the Sabbath, and not to violate or pollute it (see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-2.htm">Isaiah 56:2</a>). The idea, says Grotius, is, that they were not to travel on the Sabbath day on ordinary journeys. The 'foot' is spoken of as the instrument of motion and travel. 'Ponder the paths of thy feet' <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-26.htm">Proverbs 4:26</a>; that is, observe attentively thy goings. 'Remove thy foot from evil' <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-27.htm">Proverbs 4:27</a>; that is, abstain from evil, do not go to execute evil. So here, to restrain the foot from the Sabbath, is not to have the foot employed on the Sabbath; not to be engaged in traveling, or in the ordinary active employments of life, either for business or pleasure.<p>From doing thy pleasure on my holy day - Two things may here be observed:<p>1. God claims the day as his, and as holy on that account. While all time is his, and while he requires all time to be profitably and usefully employed, he calls the Sabbath especially his own - a day which is to be observed with reference to himself, and which is to be regarded as belonging to him. To take the hours of that day, therefore, for our pleasure, or for work which is not necessary or merciful, is to rob God of that which he claims as his own.<p>2. We are not to do our own pleasure on that day. That is, we are not to pursue our ordinary plans of amusement; we are not to devote it to feasting, to riot, or to revelry. It is true that they who love the Sabbath as they should will find 'pleasure' in observing it, for they have happiness in the service of God. But the idea is, here, that we are to do the things which God requires, and to consult his will in the observance. It is remarkable that the thing here adverted to, is the very way in which the Sabbath is commonly violated. It is not extensively a day of business, for the propriety of a periodical cessation from toil is so obvious, that people will have such days recurring at moderate intervals. But it is a day of pastime and amusement; a day not merely of relaxation from toil, but also of relaxation from the restraints of temperance and virtue. And while the Sabbath is God's great ordinance for perpetuating religion and virtue, it is also, by perversion, made Satan's great ordinance for perpetuating intemperance, dissipation, and sensuality.<p>And call the Sabbath a delight - This appropriately expresses the feelings of all who have any just views of the Sabbath. To them it is not wearisome, nor are its hours heavy. They love the day of sweet and holy rest. They esteem it a privilege, not a task, to be permitted once a week to disburden their minds of the cares, and toils, and anxieties of life. It is a 'delight' to them to recall the memory of the institution of the Sabbath, when God rested from his labors; to recall the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, to the memory of which the Christian Sabbath is consecrated; to be permitted to devote a whole day to prayer and praise, to the public and private worship of God, to services that expand the intellect and purify the heart. To the father of a family it is the source of unspeakable delight that he may conduct his children to the house of God, and that he may instruct them in the ways of religion. To the Christian man of business, the farmer, and the professional man, it is a pleasure that he may suspend his cares, and may uninterruptedly think of God and of heaven. To all who have any just feeling, the Sabbath is a 'delight;' and for them to be compelled to forego its sacred rest would be an unspeakable calamity.<p>The holy of the Lord, honorable - This more properly means, 'and call the holy of Yahweh honorable.' That is, it does not mean that they who observed the Sabbath would call it 'holy to Yahweh and honorable;' but it means that the Sabbath was, in fact, 'the holy of Yahweh,' and that they would regard it as 'honorable.' A slight inspection of the Hebrew will show that this is the sense. They who keep the Sabbath aright will esteem it a day "to be honored" (&#1502;&#1499;&#1489;&#1491;  mekuba&#770;d).<p>And shalt honor him - Or rather, shalt honor it; to wit, the Sabbath. The Hebrew will bear either construction, but the connection seems to require us to understand it of the Sabbath rather than of the Lord.<p>Not doing thine own ways - This is evidently explanatory of the phrase in the beginning of the verse. 'if thou turn away thy foot.' So the Septuagint understands it: &#x39f;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#837;  Ouk areis ton poda sou ep' ergo&#772; - 'And will not lift up thy foot to any work.' They were not to engage in secular labor, or in the execution of their own plans, but were to regard the day as belonging to God, and to be employed in his service alone.<p>Nor finding thine own pleasure - The Chaldee renders this, 'And shalt not provide on that day those things which are necessary for thee.'<p>Nor speaking thine own words - Lowth and Noyes render this, 'From speaking vain words.' The Septuagint, 'Nor utter a word in anger from thy mouth.' The Chaldee renders it, 'Words of violence.' It is necessary to add some epithet to make out the sense, as the Hebrew is literally, 'and to speak a word.' Probably our common translation has expressed the true sense, as in the previous members of the verse the phrase 'thine own' thrice occurs. And according to this, the sense is, that on the Sabbath our conversation is to be such as becomes a day which belongs to God. It is not less important that our conversation should be right on the Sabbath than it is that our conduct should be. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/58.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

(Ex 20:10, 11).<p>my holy day&#8212;God claims it as His day; to take it for our pleasure is to rob Him of His own. This is the very way in which the Sabbath is mostly broken; it is made a day of carnal pleasure instead of spiritual "delight."<p>holy of the Lord&#8212;not the predicate, but the subject; "if thou call the holy (day) of Jehovah honorable"; if thou treat it as a day to be honored.<p>him&#8212;or else, it, the Sabbath.<p>not doing &#8230; own way&#8212;answering to, "turn away thy foot from the Sabbath."<p>nor finding &#8230; pleasure&#8212;answering to, "doing thy pleasure."

The time of worship, under the Gospel dispensation, is here expressed in Old Testament language, as the service of it usually is in prophetic writings; though its proper name is the Lord's day, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>, and is here instanced in, and put for all religious institutions and services to be attended unto, and which will be with greater strictness in the times referred to: <p>from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; that is, if thou turnest away, or dost abstain from doing thine own servile work, the business of thy calling; which may be agreeable for the sake of the profit of it; or from recreations and amusements, which may be lawfully indulged on another day: <p>and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of God, and honourable; take delight and pleasure in the service of it; in all the duties of religion, private and public, to be observed on that day; in reading and hearing the word, and meditation on it; in prayer, and in attendance on all ordinances; and reckon it as separated for holy use and employment, and on that account honourable; and so have it in high esteem, and desire the return of it, and not think the service of it long and tedious, when enjoyed, and wish it was over: or, "for the Holy One of God, and honourable"; that is, for the sake of Christ, the Holy One of God, in both his natures, and honourable in his person and office; accounting the sabbath a delight, in remembrance of the great work of redemption and salvation wrought out by him: <p>and shall honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words; honour the Lord on that day, by not attending to any secular business, or walking abroad in the fields, to the neglect of private duties or public worship; by not seeking the gratification of the fleshly and sensual part, or indulging to those things which are agreeable to it; and by not speaking such words, or talking of such things, as relate to worldly affairs, or the things of civil life, but walking in the ways of the Lord, doing those things which are well pleasing in his sight, and conversing about spiritual and heavenly things; by such means God is honoured on his own day; and the reverse of this is a dishonouring him. The Jews (o) make this honour to lie chiefly in wearing other clothes on this day than on a weekday, and not walking as on other days, or talking as on them; yet they allow of thoughts, though not of words, about worldly things. <p>(o) T.

While the fasting of the day only required to be spiritualized, the sabbath observance needed both spiritualizing and increased strictness. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a> we learn that the   sabbatical years had been little observed during the later Jewish kingdom; and it would Seem from the present passage (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21-23</a>) that even the observance of the sabbath itself had been neglected. Not that the neglect was total. The sacrifices proper to the sabbath were duly offered - the "solemn assembly" was duly called and attended (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>); but during the rest of the day business flowed in its usual course - the complete sanctification of the entire day was set aside. We find a similar laxity prevalent after the return from the Captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-31.htm">Nehemiah 10:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-15.htm">Nehemiah 13:15, 16</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> treat it with reverence, as if it were "holy ground" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-5.htm">Exodus 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-27.htm">Proverbs 4:27</a>). From doing thy pleasure; rather, <span class="accented">from doing thy business -</span> the same expression as in ver. 3. It is by "business," not by pleasure, that the sabbath was polluted both in the time of Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21-23</a>) and of Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-31.htm">Nehemiah 10:31</a>, etc.). And call the sabbath a delight. This is the spiritualization of the sabbath - "to call" and feel it "a delight," a real satisfaction to the soul, not a weariness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>), as it was to many. And shalt honour him; rather, <span class="accented">and shalt honour it</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the sabbath, which is made masculine here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-2.htm">Isaiah 56:2</a>. The sabbath was to be honoured by men not pursuing their own ordinary ways, or engaging in their regular business, or even carrying on their ordinary everyday talk. Literally, the command is, not to "speak words;" but no Jews were ever such strict sabbatarians as to understand this as prohibiting <span class="accented">all</span> speech on the sabbath. Some have held that sabbatical talk should be scanty, limited, restrained as much as possible; but even for this there is no warrant. It is the quality, rather than the quantity, of the words uttered that is of real importance. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/58.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Whilst the people on the fast-day are carrying on their worldly, selfish, everyday business, the fasting is perverted from a means of divine worship and absorption in the spiritual character of the day to the most thoroughly selfish purposes: it is supposed to be of some worth and to merit some reward. This work-holy delusion, behind which self-righteousness and unrighteousness were concealed, is met thus by Jehovah through His prophet: "Can such things as these pass for a fast that I have pleasure in, as a day for a man to afflict his soul? To bow down his head like a bulrush, and spread sackcloth and ashes under him - dost thou call this a fast and an acceptable day for Jehovah? Is not this a fast that I have pleasure in: To loose coils of wickedness, to untie the bands of the yoke, and for sending away the oppressed as free, and that ye break every kind of yoke? Is it not this, to break thy bread to the hungry, and to take the poor and houseless to thy home; when thou seest a naked man that thou clothest him, and dost not deny thyself before thine own flesh?" The true worship, which consists in works of merciful love to one's brethren, and its great promises are here placed in contrast with the false worship just described. &#1492;&#1499;&#1494;&#1492; points backwards: is such a fast as this a fast after Jehovah's mind, a day on which it can be said in truth that a man afflicts his soul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29</a>)? The &#1492; of &#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1507; is resumed in &#1492;&#1500;&#1494;&#1492;; the second &#1500; is the object to &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; expressed as a dative. The first &#1500; answers to our preposition "to" with the infinitive, which stands here at the beginning like a casus absol. (to hang down; for which the inf. abs. &#1492;&#1499;&#1508;&#1493;&#1507; might also be used), and as in most other cases passes over into the finite (et quod saccum et cinerem substernit, viz., sibi: Ges. 132, Anm. 2). To hang down the head and sit in sackcloth and ashes - this does not in itself deserve the name of fasting and of a day of gracious reception (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-2.htm">Isaiah 61:2</a>) on the part of Jehovah (&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; for a subjective genitive).<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a> affirm that the fasting which is pleasant to Jehovah consists in something very different from this, namely, in releasing the oppressed, and in kindness to the helpless; not in abstinence form eating as such, but in sympathetic acts of that self-denying love, which gives up bread or any other possession for the sake of doing good to the needy.<p>(Note: The ancient church connected fasting with almsgiving by law. Dressel, Patr. Ap. p. 493.)<p>There is a bitter irony in these words, just as when the ancients said, "not eating is a natural fast, but abstaining form sin is a spiritual fast." During the siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans a general emancipation of the slaves of Israelitish descent (who were to be set free, according to the law, every three years) was resolved upon and carried out; but as soon as the Chaldeans were gone, the masters fetched their liberated slaves back into servitude again (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-8.htm">Jeremiah 34:8-22</a>). And as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6</a> shows, they carried the same selfish and despotic disposition with them into captivity. The &#1494;&#1492; which points forwards is expanded into infin. absolutes, which are carried on quite regularly in the finite tense. Mo&#772;ta&#770;h, which is repeated palindromically, signifies in both cases a yoke, lit., vectis, the cross wood which formed the most important part of the yoke, and which was fastened to the animal's head, and so connected with the plough by means of a cord or strap (Sir. 30:13; 33:27).<p>(Note: I have already observed at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-6.htm">Isaiah 47:6</a>, in vindication of what was stated at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-27.htm">Isaiah 10:27</a>, that the yoke was not in the form of a collar. I brought the subject under the notice of Prof. Schegg, who wrote to me immediately after his return from his journey to Palestine to the following effect: "I saw many oxen ploughing in Egypt, Palestine, Syria, and the neighbourhood of Ephesus; and in every case the yoke was a cross piece of wood laid upon the neck of the animal, and fastened to the pole of the plough by a cord which passed under the neck of the animal.")<p>It is to this that &#1488;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, knots, refers. We cannot connect it with mutteh, a state of perverted right (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-9.htm">Ezekiel 9:9</a>), as Hitzig does. &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; are persons unjustly and forcibly oppressed even with cruelty; &#1512;&#1510;&#1509; is a stronger synonym to &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511; (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-1.htm">Amos 4:1</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a> we have the same spirit of general humanity as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-13.htm">Job 31:13-23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-7.htm">Ezekiel 18:7-8</a> (compare what James describes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a> as "pure religion and undefiled"). &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; (&#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;) &#1508;&#1512;&#1509; is the usual phrase for &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd; (&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;) &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;. &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; is the adjective to &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, and apparently therefore must be derived from &#1502;&#1512;&#1491;: miserable men who have shown themselves refractory towards despotic rulers. But the participle ma&#770;ru&#772;d cannot be found elsewhere; and the recommendation to receive political fugitives has a modern look. The parallels in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-7.htm">Lamentations 1:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-19.htm">Lamentations 3:19</a> are conclusive evidence, that the word is intended as a derivative of &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, to wander about, and it is so rendered in the lxx, Targ., and Jerome (vagos). But &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1491;, pl. &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, is no adjective; and there is nothing to recommend the opinion, that by "wanderers" we are to understand Israelitish men. Ewald supposes that &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; may be taken as a part. hoph. for &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, hunted away, like &#1492;&#1502;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-2.htm">2 Kings 11:2</a> (Keri &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;); but it cannot be shown that the language allowed of this shifting of a vowel-sound. We prefer to assume that &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; (persecuted) is regarded as part. pass., even if only per metaplasmum, from &#1502;&#1512;&#1491;, a secondary form of &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; (cf., &#1502;&#1499;&#1505;, &#1502;&#1500;&#1509;, &#1502;&#1510;&#1495;, makuna). <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a> is still the virtual subject to &#1488;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1510;&#1493;&#1501;. The apodosis to the hypothetical &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; commences with a perf. consec., which then passes into the pausal future &#1514;&#1514;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;. In hsilgnE:egaugnaL\&&#1502;&#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1498; (from thine own flesh) it is presupposed that all men form one united whole as being of the same flesh and blood, and that they form one family, owing to one another mutual love. </body></html>
