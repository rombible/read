We must turn from travelling on that day; from doing our pleasure on that holy day, without the control and restraint of conscience; or from indulging in the pleasures of sense. On sabbath days we must not follow our callings, or our pleasures. In all we say and do, we must put a difference between this day and other days. Even in Old Testament times the sabbath was called the Lord's day, and is fitly called so still; and for a further reason, it is the Lord Christ's day, Re 1:10. If we thus remember the sabbath day to keep it holy, we shall have the comfort and profit of it, and have reason to say, It is good to draw near to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/58.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord - That is, as a consequence of properly observing the Sabbath, thou shalt find pleasure in Yahweh. It will be a pleasure to draw near to him, and you shall no longer be left to barren ordinances and to unanswered prayers. The delight or pleasure which God's people have in him is a direct and necessary consequence of the proper observance of the Sabbath. It is on that day set apart by his own authority, for his own service, that he chooses to meet with his people, and to commune with them and bless them; and no one ever properly observed the Sabbath who did not find, as a consequence, that he had augmented pleasure in the existence, the character, and the service of Yahweh. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-21.htm">Job 22:21-26</a>, where the principle stated here - that the observance of the law of God will lead to happiness in the Almighty - is beautifully illustrated (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-4.htm">Psalm 37:4</a>).<p>And I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth - A phrase like this occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a> : 'He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of fields.' In <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-19.htm">Habakkuk 3:19</a>, the phrase also occurs: 'He will make my feet like hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places.' So also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-33.htm">Psalm 18:33</a> : 'He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places.' In <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>, it is applied to God: 'He maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth.' Kimchi, Calvin, and Grotius suppose that the idea here is, that God would restore the exiled Jews to their own land - a land of mountains and elevated places, more lofty than the surrounding regions. Vitringa says that the phrase is taken from a conqueror, who on his horse or in his chariot, occupies mountains, hills, towers, and monuments, and subjects them to himself. Rosenmuller supposes it means, 'I will place you in lofty and inaccessible places, where you will be safe from all your enemies.' Gesenius also supposes that the word 'high places' here means fastnesses or strongholds, and that to walk over those strongholds, or to ride over them, is equivalent to possessing them, and that he who has possession of the fastnesses has possession of the whole country (see his Lexicon on the word &#1489;&#1502;&#1492;  ba&#770;ma&#770;h, No. 2). I give these views of the most distinguished commentators on the passage, not being able to determine satisfactorily to myself what is the true signification. Neither of the above expositions seems to me to be entirely free from difficulty. The general idea of prosperity and security is undoubtedly the main thing intended; but what is the specific sense couched under the phrase 'to ride on the high places of the earth,' does not seem to me to be sufficiently explained.<p>And feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father - That is, thou shalt possess the land promised to Jacob as an inheritance.<p>For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it - This formula often occurs when an important promise is made, and it is regarded as ample security for the fulfillment that Yahweh has promised it. What more ample security can be required, or conceived, than the promise of the eternal God?<p>Remarks on <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-1.htm">Isaiah 58:1-14</a><p>I. From <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-1.htm">Isaiah 58:1-6</a>, and the exposition given of these verses, particularly <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6</a>, we may make the following remarks respecting slavery.<p>1. That the prophets felt themselves at entire liberty to animadvert on slavery as an evil. They did not feel themselves restrained from doing it by the fact that slavery was sustained by law, or by the plea that it was a civil institution, and that the ministers of religion had nothing to do with it. The holy men who were sent by God as his ambassadors, did not suppose that, in lifting up the voice against this institution, they were doing anything contrary to what fairly came within their notice as religious teachers, nor did they regard it as, in such a sense, a civil institution that they were not to advert to it.<p>It is often said in our country that slavery is a civil institution; that it pertains solely to political affairs; that the constitution and the laws suppose its existence, and make provision for its perpetuity; that it is not appropriate for the ministers of religion, and for ecclesiastical bodies to intermeddle with it. This plea, however, might have been urged with much more force among the Hebrews. Their constitution was, what ours is not, of divine appointment, and it would have been easy for a friend of slavery to say that the prophets were interfering with what was sanctioned by the laws, and with the arrangements which were made for its perpetuity in the commonwealth. Why would not such an argument have as much weight then as it should be allowed to have now?<p>2. The prophet Isaiah felt himself at entire liberty to exhort the people to restore their slaves to freedom. He considered that slavery was as proper a subject for him to discuss as any other. He treated it as entirely within his province, and did not hesitate at all to express his views on it as an evil, and to demand that the evil should cease, in order to an acceptable worship of God.<p>3. He does not speak of it as a good and desirable institution, or as contributing to the welfare of the community. It is, in his view, a hard and oppressive system; a system which should be abandoned if people would render acceptable service to God. There is no apology made for it; no pleading for it as a desirable system; no attempt made to show that it is in accordance with the laws of the land and with the laws of God. It would not be difficult to imagine what would be the emotions of Isaiah if, after he had written this 58th chapter of his prophecies, it should be represented that he was the friend of slavery, or if he were to read some of the vindications of the systems published in this Christian land by ministers of the gospel, and by ecclesiastical bodies, or should hear the sentiments uttered in debate in Synods, Assemblies, Conferences, and Conventions.<p>4. It may be inferred from the exposition given, that Isaiah did not suppose that slavery was in accordance with the spirit of the Mosaic institutions, or that those institutions were designed to perpetuate it. His treatment of it is just such as would be natural on the supposition that the Mosaic institutions were so made that, while it was for a while tolerated - just as polygamy and divorce were - yet that it was the tendency and design of the Mosaic system ultimately to remove the evil entirely, and to make the Hebrews throughout a free people, and that it was therefore proper for him, as a prophet, to enjoin on them the duty of letting all the oppressed go free. It may be added, that if this was proper in the time of Isaiah, it cannot be less proper under the light of the gospel and in the nineteenth century.<p>II. From the closing portion of this chapter <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-13.htm">Isaiah 58:13-14</a>, we may derive the following important inferences respecting the Sabbath:<p>1. It is to be of perpetual obligation. The whole chapter occurs in the midst of statements that relate to the times of the Messiah. There is no intimation that the Sabbath was to be abolished, but it is fairly implied that its observance was to be attended with most happy results in those future times. At all events, Isaiah regarded it as of binding obligation, and felt that its proper observance was identified with the national welfare.<p>2. We may see the manner in which the Sabbath is to be observed. In no place in the Bible is there a more full account of the proper mode of keeping that holy day. We are to refrain from ordinary traveling and employments; we are not to engage in doing our own pleasure; we are to regard it with delight, and to esteem it a day worthy to be honored; and we are to show respect to it by not performing our own ordinary works, or pursuing pleasures, or engaging in the common topics of conversation. In this description there occurs nothing of unique Jewish ceremony, and nothing which indicates that it is not to be observed in this manner at all times. Under the gospel, assuredly, it is as proper to celebrate the Sabbath in this way, as it was in the times of Isaiah, and God doubtless intended that it should be perpetually observed in this manner.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/58.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. delight &#8230; in &#8230; Lord&#8212;God rewards in kind, as He punishes in kind.

The world itself was the "heritage of Jacob," since in him and his seed "all the families of the earth were to be blessed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a>). Israel, having laid aside its formalism, and turned to God sincerely. keeping fast and sabbath as God would have them kept, not in the letter, but in the spirit, would enter upon the promised heritage, and occupy the position originally assigned to it. Israel's rejection of the gospel made the mixed Christian Church the inheritress of the old promises. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/58.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet now proceeds to point out the reward of divine grace, which would follow such a fast as this, consisting of self-renouncing, self-sacrificing love; and in the midst of the promise he once more reminds of the fact, that this love is the condition of the promise. This divides the promises into two. The middle promise is linked on to the first; the morning dawn giving promise of the "perfect day" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a>). The first series of promises we have in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-9.htm">Isaiah 58:9</a>. "Then will thy light break forth as the morning dawn, and thy healing will sprout up speedily, and thy righteousness will go before thee, the glory of Jehovah will follow thee. Then wilt thou call and Jehovah will answer; thou wilt beseech, and He will say, Here am I!" The love of God is called "light" in contrast with His wrath; and a quiet cheerful life in God's love is so called, in contrast with a wild troubled life spent in God's wrath. This life in God's love has its dawn and its noon-day. When it is night both within and around a man, and he suffers himself to be awakened by the love of God to a reciprocity of love; then does the love of God, like the rising sun, open for itself a way through the man's dark night and overcome the darkness of wrath, but so gradually that the sky within is at first only streaked as it were with the red of the morning dawn, the herald of the sun. A second figure of a promising character follows. The man is sick unto death; but when the love of God stimulates him to reciprocal love, he is filled with new vigour, and his recovery springs up suddenly; he feels within him a new life working through with energetic force like a miraculous springing up of verdure from the earth, or of growing and flowering plants. The only other passages in which &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; occurs are in the books of Jeremiah, Chronicles, and Nehemiah. It signifies recovery (lxx here, &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;, an old mistake for &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, vestimenta), and hence general prosperity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-13.htm">2 Chronicles 24:13</a>).

(though rarely) arika, signifies properly, setting to rights, i.e., restoration. <p>The third promise is: "thy righteousness will go before thee, the glory of Jehovah will gather thee, or keep thee together," i.e., be thy rear-guard (lxx &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3b5;, enclose thee with its protection; &#1488;&#1505;&#1507; as in &#1502;&#1488;&#1505;&#1468;&#1507;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-12.htm">Isaiah 52:12</a>). The figure is a significant one: the first of the mercies of God is &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;, and the last &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;. When Israel is diligent in the performance of works of compassionate love, it is like an army on the march or a travelling caravan, for which righteousness clear and shows the way as being the most appropriate gift of God, and whose rear is closed by the glory of God, which so conducts it to its goal that not one is left behind. The fourth promise assures them of the immediate hearing of prayer, of every appeal to God, every cry for help.<p>But before the prophet brings his promises up to their culminating point, he once more lays down the condition upon which they rest. "If thou put away from the midst of thee the yoke, the pointing of the finger, and speaking of evil, and offerest up thy gluttony to the hungry, and satisfiest the soul that is bowed down: thy light will stream out in the darkness, and thy darkness become like the brightness of noon-day. And Jehovah will guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in droughts, and refresh thy bones; and thou wilt become like a well-watered garden, and like a fountain, whose waters never deceive. And thy people will build ruins of the olden time, foundations of earlier generations wilt thou erect; and men will call thee repairers of breaches, restorers of habitable streets." &#1502;&#1493;&#1496;&#1492;, a yoke, is here equivalent to yoking or oppression, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6</a>, where it stands by the side of &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1470;&#1488;&#1510;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488; (only met with here, for &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;, Ges. 65, 1, a), the stretching out of the finger, signifies a scornful pointing with the fingers (<a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13</a>, &#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;) at humbler men, and especially at such as are godly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-4.htm">Isaiah 57:4</a>). &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1470;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, the utterance of things which are wicked in themselves and injurious to one's neighbour, hence sinful conversation in general. The early commentators looked for more under &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, than is really meant (and so does even Stier: "they soul, thy heart, all thy sympathetic feelings," etc.). The name of the soul, which is regarded here as greedily longing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-11.htm">Isaiah 56:11</a>), is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-6.htm">Deuteronomy 24:6</a> for that which nourishes it, and here for that which it longs for; the longing itself (appetitus) for the object of the longing (Psychol. p. 204). We may see this very clearly from the choice of the verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1511; (a voluntative in a conditional clause, Ges. 128, 2), which, starting from the primary meaning educere (related to &#1504;&#1508;&#1511;, Arabic anfaqa, to give out, distribute, nafaqa, distribution, especially of alms), signifies both to work out, acquire, carry off (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-13.htm">Proverbs 3:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-35.htm">Proverbs 8:35</a>, etc.), and also to take out, deliver, offer, expromere (as in this instance and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-9.htm">Psalm 140:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-13.htm">Psalm 144:13</a>). The soul "bowed down" is bowed down in this instance through abstinence. The apodoses commence with the perf. cons. &#1493;&#1494;&#1512;&#1495;. &#1488;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492; is the darkness caused by the utter absence of light (Arab. afalat esh-shemsu, "the sun has become invisible"); see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-22.htm">Job 10:22</a>. This, as the substantive clause affirms, is like the noon-day, which is called &#1510;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, because at that point the daylight of both the forenoon and afternoon, the rising and setting light, is divided as it were into two by the climax which it has attained. A new promise points to the fat, that such a man may enjoy without intermission the mild and safe guidance of divine grace, for which &#1504;&#1495;&#1492; (&#1492;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492;, syn. &#1504;&#1492;&#1500;) is the word commonly employed; and another to the communication of the most copious supply of strength. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1; &#1489;&#1510;&#1495;&#1510;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; does not state with what God will satisfy the soul, as Hahn supposes (after Jerome, "splendoribus"), but according to &#1510;&#1505;&#1492;&#1497;&#1495;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-7.htm">Psalm 68:7</a>) and such promises as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-20.htm">Isaiah 43:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-21.htm">Isaiah 48:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-10.htm">Isaiah 49:10</a>, the kind of satisfaction and the circumstances under which it occurs, viz., in extreme droughts (Targ. "years of drought"). In the place of the perf. cons. we have then the future, which facilitates the elevation of the object: "and thy bones will He make strong," &#1497;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1495;, for which Hupfeld would read &#1497;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1507;, "will He rejuvenate." &#1495;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1509; is a denom. of &#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, expeditus; it may, however, be directly derived from a verb &#1495;&#1500;&#1509;, presupposed by &#1495;&#1500;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, not, however, in the meaning "to be fat" (lxx &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, and so also Kimchi), but "to be strong," lit., to be loose or ready for action; and b. Jebamoth 102b has the very suitable gloss &#1490;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497; &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1494;&#1497; (making the bones strong). This idea of invigorating is then unfolded in two different figures, of which that of a well-watered garden sets forth the abundance received, that of a spring the abundance possessed. Natural objects are promised, but as a gift of grace; for this is the difference between the two testaments, that in the Old Testament the natural is ever striving to reach the spiritual, whereas in the New Testament the spiritual lifts up the natural to its own level. The Old Testament is ever striving to give inwardness to what was outward; in the New Testament this object is attained, and the further object now is to make the outward conformed to the inward, the natural life to the spiritual. <p>The last promise (whether the seventh or eighth, depends upon whether we include the growing of the morning light into the light of noon, or not) takes its form from the pining of the exiles for their home: "and thy people (&#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498;) build" (Ewald, 295, c); and Bttcher would read &#1502;&#1502;&#1498; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;; but &#1502;&#1503; with a passive, although more admissible in Hebrew than in Arabic, is very rarely met with, and then more frequently in the sense of &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769; than in that of &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; followed by a plural of the thing would be more exact than customary. Moreover, there is no force in the objection that &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498; with the active can only signify "some of thee," since it is equivalent to &#1502;&#1502;&#1498; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, those who sprang from thee and belong to thee by kindred descent. The members born to the congregation in exile will begin, as soon as they return to their home, to build up again the ruins of olden time, the foundations of earlier generations, i.e., houses and cities of which only the foundations are left (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-4.htm">Isaiah 61:4</a>); therefore Israel restored to its fatherland receives the honourable title of "builder of breaches," "restorer of streets (i.e., of places much frequented once) &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;" (for inhabiting), i.e., so that, although so desolate now (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-8.htm">Isaiah 33:8</a>), they become habitable and populous once more. </body></html>
