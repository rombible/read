Both king and prophet had the same words of comfort for the feeble and faint-hearted, and the ground of comfort is that the government of God is essentially a righteous government, punishing the oppressor, and saving the oppressed. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/1-6.htm" title="Be strong and of a good courage: for to this people shall you divide for an inheritance the land, which I swore to their fathers to give them.">Joshua 1:6-7</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/35.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>35:1-4 Judea was prosperous in the days of Hezekiah, but the kingdom of Christ is the great subject intended. Converting grace makes the soul that was a wilderness, to rejoice with joy and singing, and to blossom abundantly. The feeble and faint-hearted are encouraged. This is the design of the gospel. Fear is weakening; the more we strive against it, the stronger we are, both for doing and suffering; and he that says to us, Be strong, has laid help for us upon One who is mighty. Assurance is given of the approach of Messiah, to take vengeance on the powers of darkness, to recompense with abundant comforts those that mourn in Zion; He will come and save. He will come again at the end of time, to punish those who have troubled his people; and to give those who were troubled such rest as will be a full reward for all their troubles.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Say to them - This is still an address to the ministers of religion, to make use of all the consolations which these truths and predictions furnish to confirm and strengthen the people of God.<p>Of a fearful heart - Of a timid, pusillanimous heart; those who tremble before their enemies. The Hebrew is, as in the Margin, 'Of a hasty heart;' that is, of those who are disposed to flee before their enemies (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-16.htm">Isaiah 30:16</a>).<p>Behold, your God will come with vengeance - That is, in the manner described in the previous chapter; and, generally, he will take vengeance on all the enemies of his people, and they shall be punished. The language in this chapter is, in part, derived from the captivity at Babylon <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>, and the general idea is, that God would take vengeance on all their enemies, and would bring them complete and final deliverance. This does not mean that when the Messiah should come he would be disposed to take vengeance; nor do the words 'your God' here refer to the Messiah; but it is meant that their God, Yahweh, would certainly come and destroy all their enemies, and prepare the way thus for the coming of the Prince of peace. The general promise is, that however many enemies might attack them, or however much they might fear them, yet that Yahweh would be their protector, and would completely humble and prostrate all their foes. The Hebrew will admit of a somewhat different translation, which I give in accordance with that proposed by Lowth. The sense is not materially varied.<p>Say ye to the faint-hearted, Be ye strong; fear ye not; behold your God!<p>Vengeance will come; the retribution of God:<p>He himself will come, and will deliver you. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. fearful&#8212;"hasty," Margin; that is, with a heart fluttered with agitation.<p>with&#8212;the Hebrew is more forcible than the English Version: "God will come, vengeance! even God, a recompense!"

The predominant thought of the prophet appears to have been Messianic, and hence the burst of glorious prophecy which follows  - a burst of prophecy most inadequately expounded of the time of the return from the Captivity. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The allusion to the monarchy and the lofty electoral dignity leads the prophet on to the palaces and castles of the land. Starting with these, he carries out the picture of the ruins in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-13.htm">Isaiah 34:13-15</a>. "And the palaces of Edom break out into thorns, nettles and thistles in its castles; and it becomes the abode of wild dogs, pasture for ostriches. And martens meet with jackals, and a wood-devil runs upon its fellow; yea, Liiliith dwells there, and finds rest for itself. There the arrow-snake makes its nest, and breeds and lays eggs, and broods in the shadow there; yea, there vultures gather together one to another." The feminine suffixes refer to Edom, as they did in the previous instance, as &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501; or &#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;. On the tann&#305;&#772;m, tsiyy&#305;&#772;m, and 'iyy&#305;&#772;m, see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21-22</a>. It is doubtful whether cha&#770;ts&#305;&#772;r here corresponds to the Arabic word for an enclosure ( equals  &#1495;&#1510;&#1512;), as Gesenius, Hitzig, and others suppose, as elsewhere to the Arabic for green, a green field, or garden vegetable. We take it in the latter sense, viz., a grassy place, such as was frequented by ostriches, which live upon plants and fruits. The word tsiyyim (steppe animals) we have rendered "martens," as the context requires a particular species of animals to be named. This is the interpretation given by Rashi (in loc.) and Kimchi in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-39.htm">Jeremiah 50:39</a> to the Targum word tamva&#770;n. We do not render 'iyy&#305;&#772;m "wild cats" (chattu&#772;ilin), but "jackals," after the Arabic. &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; with &#1506;&#1500; we take in the sense of &#1511;&#1512;&#1492; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-3.htm">Exodus 5:3</a>). L&#305;&#772;l&#305;&#772;th (Syr. and Zab. lelitho), lit., the creature of the night, was a female demon (she&#772;da&#770;h) of the popular mythology; according to the legends, it was a malicious fairy that was especially hurtful to children, like some of the fairies of our own fairy tales. There is life in Edom still; but what a caricature of that which once was there! In the very spot where the princes of Edom used to proclaim the new king, satyrs now invite one another to dance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>); and there kings and princes once slept in their palaces and country houses, the l&#305;&#772;l&#305;&#772;th, which is most at home in horrible places, finds, as though after a prolonged search, the most convenient and most comfortable resting-place. Demons and serpents are not very far distant from one another. The prophet therefore proceeds in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-15.htm">Isaiah 34:15</a> to the arrow-snake, or springing-snake (Arabic qiffa&#770;ze, from qa&#770;phaz, related to qa&#770;phats, Sol 2:8, to prepare for springing, or to spring; a different word from qippo&#772;d, which has the same root). This builds its nest in the ruins; there it breeds (mille&#772;t, to let its eggs slide out) and lays eggs (ba&#770;qa&#8219;, to split, i.e., to bring forth); and then it broods in the shade (da&#770;gar is the Targum word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-14.htm">Job 39:14</a> for chimme&#772;m (ithpael in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-20.htm">Lamentations 1:20</a> for &#1495;&#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1512;), and is also used in the rabbinical writings for fovere, as Jerome renders it here). The literal sense of the word is probably to keep the eggs together (Targum, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-11.htm">Jeremiah 17:11</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1503; &#1502;&#1499;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, lxx &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;), since &#1491;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512; (syn. &#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;) signifies "to collect." Rashi has therefore explained it in both passages as meaning glousser, to cluck, the noise by which a fowl calls its brood together. The dayya&#770;h is the vulture. These fowls and most gregarious birds of prey also collect together there. </body></html>
