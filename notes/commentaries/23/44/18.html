Though a man had used part of a log for fuel, he fell down before an image made of the remainder, praying it to deliver him. Man greatly dishonours God, when he represents him after the image of man. Satan blinds the eyes of unbelievers, causing absurd reasonings in matters of religion. Whether men seek happiness in worldly things, or run into unbelief, superstition, or any false system, they feed on ashes. A heart deceived by pride, love of sin, and departure from God, turns men aside from his holy truth and worship. While the affections are depraved, a man holds fast the lie as his best treasure. Are our hearts set upon the wealth of the world and its pleasures? They will certainly prove a lie. If we trust to outward professions and doings, as if those would save us, we deceive ourselves. Self-suspicion is the first step towards self-deliverance. He that would deliver his soul, must question his conscience, Is there not a lie in my right hand?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/44.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They have not known nor understood - They are stupid, ignorant, and blind. Nothing could more strikingly show their ignorance and stupidity than this idol worship.<p>He hath shut their eyes - God hath closed their eyes. Margin, 'Daubed.' The word used here, &#1496;&#1492;  t&#803;ah from &#1496;&#1493;&#1492;  t&#803;u&#770;ah denotes properly "to spread over"; to besmear; to plaster; as, e. g., a wall with mortar <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-42.htm">Leviticus 14:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-4.htm">1 Chronicles 29:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-28.htm">Ezekiel 22:28</a>. Here it means to cover over the eyes so as to prevent vision; and hence, metaphorically, to make them stupid, ignorant, dull. It is attributed to God in accordance with the common statement of the Scriptures, that he does what he permits to be done (see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>). It does not mean that God had done it by any physical, or direct agency, but that it had occurred under the administration of his Providence. It is also true that the Hebrew writers sometimes employ an active verb when the signification is passive, and when the main idea is, that anything was in fact done. Here the main point is not the agent by which this was done, but the fact that their eyes were blinded - and perhaps all the force of the verb &#1496;&#1492;  t&#803;ah used here would be expressed if it was rendered in an impersonal, or in a passive form, 'it is covered as to their eyes,' that is, their eyes are shut, without suggesting that it was done by God. So the Septuagint renders it, &#x391;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  Ape&#772;mauro&#772;the&#772;san - 'They are blind,' or involved in darkness.<p>So the Chaldee, &#1502;&#1496;&#1502;&#1496;&#1502;&#1503;  met&#803;met&#803;ema&#770;n (also in the plural) - 'Their eyes are obscured' or blind. It cannot be proved from this text that God is, by direct agency, the author by whom it was done. It was not uncommon to shut up, or seal up the eyes for various purposes in the East, and unquestionably the prophet alludes to some such custom. 'It is one of the solemnities at a Jewish wedding at Aleppo, according to Dr. Russell, who mentions it as the most remarkable thing in their ceremonies at that time. It is done by fastening the eyelids together with a gum, and the bridegroom is the person, he says, if he remembered right, that opens the bride's eyes at the appointed time. It is also used as a punishment in those countries. So Sir Thomas Roe's chaplain, in his account of his voyages to East India, tells us of a son of the Great Mogul, whom he had seen, and with whom Sir Thomas had conversed, that had before that time been cast into prison by his father, where his eyes were sealed up, by something put before them, which might not be taken off for three years; after which time the seal was taken away, that he might with freedom enjoy the light, though not his liberty.' (Harmer's Obs. vol. iii., pp. 507, 508. Ed. Lond. 8vo, 1808.) <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/44.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. he, &c.&#8212;God hath given them over to judicial blindness; not His direct physical, but His providential agency in administering His moral government, is meant (Isa 6:9, 10).

And therefore men need not to be shy in ascribing it to God here. Which yet is to be soberly understood; not as if God did make men wicked, but only permits them so to be, and orders and overrules their wickedness to his own glorious ends. And such passages as these are added in such cases to give an account of the prodigious madness of sinners herein; because, as they wilfully shut their own eyes, and harden their own hearts, so God judicially blinds and hardens them, and sends strong delusions upon them, and gives them up to believe lies, and then it is no wonder if they fall into such dotages. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/44.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>They have not known nor understood,....

"The iron-smith has a chisel, and works with red-hot coals, and shapes it with hammers, and works it with his powerful arm. He gets hungry thereby, and his strength fails; if he drink no water, he becomes exhausted. The carpenter draws the line, marks it with the pencil, carries it out with planes, and makes a drawing of it with the compass, and carries it out like the figure of a man, like the beauty of a man, which may dwell in the house." The two words cha&#770;rash barzel are connected together in the sense of faber ferrarius, as we may see from the expression cha&#770;rash &#8219;e&#772;ts&#305;&#772;m (the carpenter, faber lignarius), which follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-13.htm">Isaiah 44:13</a>. Cha&#770;rash is the construct of cha&#770;ra&#770;sh ( equals  charra&#770;sh), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-11.htm">Exodus 28:11</a>. The second kametz of this form of noun does indeed admit of contraction, but only to the extent of a full short vowel; consequently the construct of the plural is not &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, but &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-16.htm">Isaiah 45:16</a>, etc.). Hence <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-12.htm">Isaiah 44:12</a> describes how the smith constructs an idol of iron, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-13.htm">Isaiah 44:13</a> how the carpenter makes one of wood. But the first clause, &#1502;&#1506;&#1510;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500; &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, is enigmatical. In any case, &#1502;&#1506;&#1510;&#1491; is a smith's tool of some kind (from &#1506;&#1510;&#1491;, related to &#1495;&#1510;&#1491;). And consequently Gesenius, Umbreit, and others, adopt the rendering, "the smith an axe, that does he work ... ;" but the further account of the origin of an idol says nothing at all about this axe, which the smith supplies to the carpenter, that he may hew out an idol with it. Hitzig renders it, "The smith, a hatchet does he work, and forms it (viz., into an idol);" but what a roundabout way! first to make a hatchet and then make it into an idol, which would look very slim when made. Knobel translates it, "As for the cutting-smith, he works it;" but this guild of cutting-smiths certainly belongs to Utopia. The best way to render the sentence intelligible, would be to supply &#1500;&#1493;: "The smith has (uses) the ma&#8219;a&#774;tsa&#770;d." But in all probability a word has dropped out; and the Septuagint rendering, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c9;&#787;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3ba;.&#x3c4;.&#x3bb;, shows that the original reading of the text was &#1502;&#1506;&#1510;&#1491; &#1489;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500; &#1495;&#1512;&#1505; &#1495;&#1491;&#1491;, and that &#1495;&#1491;&#1491; got lost on account of its proximity to &#1497;&#1495;&#1509;. The meaning therefore is, "The smith has sharpened, or sharpens (chidde&#772;d, syn. shinne&#772;n) the ma&#8219;a&#774;tsa&#770;d," possibly the chisel, to cut the iron upon the anvil; and works with red-hot coals, making the iron red-hot by blowing the fire. The piece of iron which he cuts off is the future idol, and this he shapes with hammers (&#1497;&#1510;&#1512;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; the future of &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;). And what of the carpenter? He stretches the line upon the block of wood, to measure the length and breadth of the idol; he marks it upon the wood with red-stone (sered, rubrica, used by carpenters), and works it with planes (maqtsu&#8219;o&#772;th, a feminine form of &#1502;&#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1506;, from &#1511;&#1510;&#1506;, to cut off, pare off, plane; compare the Arabic mikta&#8219;), and with the compasses (mechu&#772;ga&#770;h, the tool used, la&#770;chu&#772;g, i.e. for making a circle) he draws the outline of it, that is to say, in order that the different parts of the body may be in right proportion; and he constructs it in such a manner that it acquires the shape of a man, the beautiful appearance of a man, to be set up like a human inmate in either a temple or private house. The piel &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; (&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;), from which comes yeta&#772;a&#774;re&#772;hu&#772;, is varied here (according to Isaiah's custom; cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-7.htm">Isaiah 29:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-5.htm">Isaiah 26:5</a>) with the poel&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;, which is to be understood as denoting the more exact configuration. The preterites indicate the work for which both smith and carpenter have made their preparations; the futures, the work in which they are engaged. </body></html>
