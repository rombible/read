The connection of this with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-25.htm" title="That frustrates the tokens of the liars, and makes diviners mad; that turns wise men backward, and makes their knowledge foolish;">Isaiah 44:25</a>, is, As God discovers the folly and madness of such false prophets, so he punctually fulfils the predictions of his own prophets. <span class="ital">That saith to the deep, Be dry </span>— That with a word can dry up the sea and rivers, and remove all impediments. “Cyrus took Babylon by laying the bed of the Euphrates dry, and leading his army into the city by night, through the empty channel of the river. This remarkable circumstance, in which the event so exactly corresponded with the prophecy, was also noted by Jeremiah. <span class="ital">A drought shall be upon her waters, and they shall be dried up: I will lay her sea dry; and I will scorch up her springs, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-38.htm" title="A drought is on her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad on their idols.">Jeremiah 50:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-36.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD; Behold, I will plead your cause, and take vengeance for you; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry.">Jeremiah 51:36</a>. It is proper here to give some account of the method by which the stratagem of Cyrus was effected. The Euphrates, in the middle of summer, from the melting of the snows on the mountains of Armenia, like the Nile, overflows the country. In order to diminish the inundation, and carry off the waters, two canals were made by Nebuchadnezzar a hundred miles above the city; the first on the eastern side, called Naharmalca, or the Royal river, by which the Euphrates was let into the Tigris; the other on the western side, called Pallacopas, or Naharaga, (Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">נהר אגם</span>, <span class="ital">the river of the pool,</span>) by which the redundant waters were carried into a vast lake, forty miles square, contrived, not only to lessen the inundation, but for a reservoir, with sluices to water the barren country on the Arabian side. Cyrus, by turning the whole river into the latter lake, laid the channel, where it ran through the city, almost dry; so that his army entered it both above and below by the bed of the river, the water not reaching above the middle of the thigh. By the great quantity of water let into the lake, the sluices and dams were destroyed; and being never repaired afterward, the waters spread over the whole country below, and reduced it into a morass, in which the river is lost.” — Bishop Lowth.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/44.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>44:21-28 Return unto me. It is the great concern of those who have backslidden from God, like the Jews of old, to hasten their return to him. The work of redemption wrought for us by Christ, encourages to hope for all blessings from him. Our transgressions and our sins are as a thick cloud between heaven and earth: sins separate between us and God; they threaten a storm of wrath. When God pardons sin, he blots out, he dispels this cloud, this thick cloud, so that the way to heaven is open again. The cloud is scattered by the Sun of righteousness; it is quite gone. The comforts that flow into the soul when sin is pardoned, are like clear shining after clouds and rain. Let not Israel be discouraged; nothing is too hard for God: having made all, he can make what use he pleases of any. Those that learn to know Christ, see all knowledge to be foolishness, in comparison with the knowledge of him. And his enemies will find their counsels turned into foolishness, and themselves taken in their craftiness. The exact fulfilling the prophecies of Scripture confirms the truth of the whole, and proves its Divine origin. The particular favours God designed for his people in captivity, were foretold here, long before they went into captivity. Very great difficulties would be in the way of their deliverance; but it is promised that by Divine power they should all be removed. God knew who should be the Deliverer of his people; and let his church know it, that when they heard such a name talked of, they might know their redemption drew nigh. It is the greatest honour of the greatest men, to be employed as instruments of the Divine favour to his people. In things wherein men serve themselves, and look no further, God makes them do all his pleasure. And a nobler Shepherd than Cyrus does his Father's will, till his work is fully completed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/44.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy Redeemer - (See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>).<p>And he that formed thee from thee womb - (See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-2.htm">Isaiah 44:2</a>).<p>That stretcheth forth the heavens - (See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a>).<p>That spreadeth abroad the earth - Representing the earth, as is often done in the Scriptures, as a plain.
