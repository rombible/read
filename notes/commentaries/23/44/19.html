Though a man had used part of a log for fuel, he fell down before an image made of the remainder, praying it to deliver him. Man greatly dishonours God, when he represents him after the image of man. Satan blinds the eyes of unbelievers, causing absurd reasonings in matters of religion. Whether men seek happiness in worldly things, or run into unbelief, superstition, or any false system, they feed on ashes. A heart deceived by pride, love of sin, and departure from God, turns men aside from his holy truth and worship. While the affections are depraved, a man holds fast the lie as his best treasure. Are our hearts set upon the wealth of the world and its pleasures? They will certainly prove a lie. If we trust to outward professions and doings, as if those would save us, we deceive ourselves. Self-suspicion is the first step towards self-deliverance. He that would deliver his soul, must question his conscience, Is there not a lie in my right hand?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/44.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And none considereth in his heart - Margin, 'Setteth to.' He does not place the subject near his heart or mind; he does not think of it. A similar phrase occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-8.htm">Isaiah 46:8</a> : 'Bring it again to mind.' It is a phrase drawn from the act of placing an object near us, in order to examine it closely; and we express the same idea by the phrase 'looking at a thing,' or 'looking at it closely.' The sense is, they had not attentively and carefully thought on the folly of what they were doing - a sentiment which is as true of all sinners as it was of stupid idolaters.<p>An abomination - A name that is often given to an idol <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-5.htm">2 Kings 11:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-7.htm">2 Kings 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-13.htm">2 Kings 23:13</a>. The meaning is, that an idol was abominable and detestable in the sight of a holy God. It was that which he could not endure.<p>Shall I fall down to the stock of a tree? - Margin, 'That which comes of.' The word &#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;  bu&#770;l means properly "produce, increase," and here evidently a stock or trunk of wood.

"The iron-smith has a chisel, and works with red-hot coals, and shapes it with hammers, and works it with his powerful arm. He gets hungry thereby, and his strength fails; if he drink no water, he becomes exhausted. The carpenter draws the line, marks it with the pencil, carries it out with planes, and makes a drawing of it with the compass, and carries it out like the figure of a man, like the beauty of a man, which may dwell in the house." The two words cha&#770;rash barzel are connected together in the sense of faber ferrarius, as we may see from the expression cha&#770;rash &#8219;e&#772;ts&#305;&#772;m (the carpenter, faber lignarius), which follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-13.htm">Isaiah 44:13</a>. Cha&#770;rash is the construct of cha&#770;ra&#770;sh ( equals  charra&#770;sh), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-11.htm">Exodus 28:11</a>. The second kametz of this form of noun does indeed admit of contraction, but only to the extent of a full short vowel; consequently the construct of the plural is not &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, but &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-16.htm">Isaiah 45:16</a>, etc.). Hence <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-12.htm">Isaiah 44:12</a> describes how the smith constructs an idol of iron, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-13.htm">Isaiah 44:13</a> how the carpenter makes one of wood. But the first clause, &#1502;&#1506;&#1510;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500; &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, is enigmatical. In any case, &#1502;&#1506;&#1510;&#1491; is a smith's tool of some kind (from &#1506;&#1510;&#1491;, related to &#1495;&#1510;&#1491;). And consequently Gesenius, Umbreit, and others, adopt the rendering, "the smith an axe, that does he work ... ;" but the further account of the origin of an idol says nothing at all about this axe, which the smith supplies to the carpenter, that he may hew out an idol with it. Hitzig renders it, "The smith, a hatchet does he work, and forms it (viz., into an idol);" but what a roundabout way! first to make a hatchet and then make it into an idol, which would look very slim when made. Knobel translates it, "As for the cutting-smith, he works it;" but this guild of cutting-smiths certainly belongs to Utopia. The best way to render the sentence intelligible, would be to supply &#1500;&#1493;: "The smith has (uses) the ma&#8219;a&#774;tsa&#770;d." But in all probability a word has dropped out; and the Septuagint rendering, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c9;&#787;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3ba;.&#x3c4;.&#x3bb;, shows that the original reading of the text was &#1502;&#1506;&#1510;&#1491; &#1489;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500; &#1495;&#1512;&#1505; &#1495;&#1491;&#1491;, and that &#1495;&#1491;&#1491; got lost on account of its proximity to &#1497;&#1495;&#1509;. The meaning therefore is, "The smith has sharpened, or sharpens (chidde&#772;d, syn. shinne&#772;n) the ma&#8219;a&#774;tsa&#770;d," possibly the chisel, to cut the iron upon the anvil; and works with red-hot coals, making the iron red-hot by blowing the fire. The piece of iron which he cuts off is the future idol, and this he shapes with hammers (&#1497;&#1510;&#1512;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; the future of &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;). And what of the carpenter? He stretches the line upon the block of wood, to measure the length and breadth of the idol; he marks it upon the wood with red-stone (sered, rubrica, used by carpenters), and works it with planes (maqtsu&#8219;o&#772;th, a feminine form of &#1502;&#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1506;, from &#1511;&#1510;&#1506;, to cut off, pare off, plane; compare the Arabic mikta&#8219;), and with the compasses (mechu&#772;ga&#770;h, the tool used, la&#770;chu&#772;g, i.e. for making a circle) he draws the outline of it, that is to say, in order that the different parts of the body may be in right proportion; and he constructs it in such a manner that it acquires the shape of a man, the beautiful appearance of a man, to be set up like a human inmate in either a temple or private house. The piel &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; (&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;), from which comes yeta&#772;a&#774;re&#772;hu&#772;, is varied here (according to Isaiah's custom; cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-7.htm">Isaiah 29:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-5.htm">Isaiah 26:5</a>) with the poel&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;, which is to be understood as denoting the more exact configuration. The preterites indicate the work for which both smith and carpenter have made their preparations; the futures, the work in which they are engaged. </body></html>
