From the Egyptians, to whom they sought for help, unto the Lord, they had neglected; from evil ways and practices, idolatry and impiety, by repentance and reformation; to the true worship of God, to his word and ordinances, statutes and commands. The Targum is, <p>"turn to the law;'' <p>which they had rejected and broken. These are the words of the prophet, a call of his to the people to repentance, to which they might be induced by the gracious declaration of the Lord unto them, in the preceding verses, promising them preservation and safety: <p>from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted: or, "made deep a revolt" (u); had gone very far back from God, and deep into sin and ruin, that their recovery was difficult; and yet their return was absolutely necessary, which ought to be done both speedily and heartily. Some think reference is had to the deep schemes they had laid, those political ones, at least, which they thought were such, in applying to Egypt for help, when they, as it is said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-15.htm">Isaiah 29:15</a> sought "deep to hide their counsel front the Lord"; in doing which they deeply departed from him, and are here called to return to him. This is said not of the ten tribes, that were gone into captivity, but of the Jews, who were the posterity of Israel also; which is mentioned, to put them in mind of their descent, as an aggravation of their sin, and as an argument for their return. <p>(u)  Heb.

Then, at any rate, if not before, turn to him who will have delivered you from so great a peril. "Turn to him, O children of Israel, from whom men have so deeply revolted."

"And Jehovah causes His majestic voice to be heard, and causes the lowering of His arm to be seen, with the snorting of wrath and the blazing of devouring fire, the bursting of a cloud, and pouring of rain and hailstones. For Asshur will be terrified at the voice of Jehovah, when He smites with the staff. And it will come to pass, every stroke of the rod of destiny, which Jehovah causes to fall upon Asshur, is dealt amidst the noise of drums and the playing of guitars; and in battles of swinging arm He fights it. For a place for the sacrifice of abominations has long been made ready, even for the king is it prepared; deep, broad has He made it: its funeral-pile has fire and wood in abundance; the breath of Jehovah like a stream of brimstone sets it on fire." The imposing crash (on ho&#772;d, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-20.htm">Job 39:20</a>) of the cry which Jehovah causes to be heard is thunder (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1-11</a>); for the catastrophe occurs with a discharge of all the destructive forces of a storm (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-6.htm">Isaiah 29:6</a>). Nephets is the "breaking up" or "bursting," viz., of a cloud. It is through such wrath-announcing phenomena of nature that Jehovah manifests the otherwise invisible letting down of His arm to smite (nachath may possibly not be the derivative of nu&#772;a&#774;ch, "settling down," but of na&#770;chath, "the coming down," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-3.htm">Psalm 38:3</a>; just as shebheth in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-7.htm">2 Samuel 23:7</a> is not derived from shu&#772;bh, but from sha&#770;bhath, to go to ruin). <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-31.htm">Isaiah 30:31</a>, commencing with ki (for), explains the terrible nature of what occurs, from the object at which it is directed: Asshur is alarmed at the voice of Jehovah, and thoroughly goes to pieces. We must not render this, as the Targum does, "which smites with the rod," i.e., which bears itself so haughtily, so tyrannically (after <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-24.htm">Isaiah 10:24</a>). The smiter here is Jehovah (lxx, Vulg., Luther); and basshe&#772;bhet yakkeh is either an attributive clause, or, better still, a circumstantial determining clause, eo virga percutiente. According to the accents, veha&#770;ya&#770;h in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-32.htm">Isaiah 30:32</a> is introductory: "And it will come to pass, every stroke of the punishing rod falls (supply &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;) with an accompaniment of drums and guitars" (the Beth is used to denote instrumental accompaniment, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-29.htm">Isaiah 30:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-9.htm">Isaiah 24:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/49-5.htm">Psalm 49:5</a>, etc.) - namely, on the part of the people of Jerusalem, who have only to look on and rejoice in the approaching deliverance. Mu&#772;sa&#770;da&#770;h with matte&#772;h is a verbal substantive used as a genitive, "an appointment according to decree" (comp. ya&#770;sad in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-12.htm">Habakkuk 1:12</a>, and ya&#770;&#8219;ad in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-9.htm">Micah 6:9</a>). The fact that drums and guitars are heard along with every stroke, is explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-32.htm">Isaiah 30:32</a>: "Jehovah fights against Asshur with battles of swinging," i.e., not with darts or any other kind of weapon, but by swinging His arm incessantly, to smite Asshur without its being able to defend itself (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-16.htm">Isaiah 19:16</a>). Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, which points back to Asshur, not to matteh, the keri has &#1489;&#1468;&#1501;, which is not so harsh, since it is immediately preceded by &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;. This cutting down of the Assyrians is accounted for in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-33.htm">Isaiah 30:33</a>, (ki, for), from the fact that it had long ago been decreed that they should be burned as dead bodies. 'Ethmu&#772;l in contrast with ma&#770;cha&#770;r is the past: it has not happened today, but yesterday, i.e., as the predestination of God is referred to, "long ago." <p>Tophteh is the primary form of to&#772;pheth (from tu&#772;ph, not in the sense of the Neo-Persian ta&#770;ften, Zend. tap, to kindle or burn, from which comes tafedra, melting; but in the Semitic sense of vomiting or abhorring: see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-6.htm">Job 17:6</a>), the name of the abominable place where the sacrifices were offered to Moloch in the valley of Hinnom: a Tophet-like place. The word is variously treated as both a masculine and feminine, possibly because the place of abominable sacrifices is described first as ba&#770;ma&#770;h in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>. In the clause &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1503; &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;, the gam, which stands at the head, may be connected with lammelekh, "also for the king is it prepared" (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a>); but in all probability lammelekh is a play upon lammolekh (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-2.htm">Leviticus 18:2</a>), "even this has been prepared for the Melekh," viz., the king of Asshur. Because he was to be burned there, together with his army, Jehovah had made this Tophet-like place very deep, so that it might have a far-reaching background, and very broad, so that in this respect also there might be room for many sacrifices. And their medu&#772;ra&#770;h, i.e., their pile of wood (as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-9.htm">Ezekiel 24:9</a>, cf., <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-5.htm">Ezekiel 24:5</a>, from du&#772;r, Talm. dayye&#772;r, to lay round, to arrange, pile), has abundance of fire and wood (a hendiadys, like "cloud and smoke" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>). Abundance of fire: for the breath of Jehovah, pouring upon the funeral pile like a stream of brimstone, sets it on fire. &#1489;&#1468; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;, not to burn up, but to set on fire. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; points back to tophteh, like the suffix of medura&#770;tha&#770;h.<p>(Note: So far as the form of the text is concerned, ko&#772;l has the disjunctive yethib before pashta, which occurs eleven times according to the Masora. Nevertheless the word is logically connected in the closest manner with what follows (comp. 'e&#772;th to&#772;rath in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>). The a&#770;h of mu&#772;sa&#770;da&#770;h is rafatum pro mappicato, according to the Masora; in which case the suffix would refer to Asshur. In the place of &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1490;&#1501; we also meet with &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488; &#1490;&#1501;, with this chethib and keri reversed; but the former, according to which &#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1503; is equivalent to &#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1504;&#1492;, has many examples to support it in the Masora. &#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1503; has kametz in correct MSS in half pause; whereas Kimchi (Michlol, 117b) regards it as a participle.) </body></html>
