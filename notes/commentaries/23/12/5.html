When God's time is come for the deliverance of his people, mountains of opposition shall become plains before him. God can soon turn gloomy days into glorious ones. And while we expect the Lord to gather his ancient people, and bring them home to his church, also to bring in the fulness of the Gentiles, when all will be united in holy love, let us tread the highway of holiness he has made for his redeemed. Let us wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life, looking to him to prepare our way through death, that river which separates this world from the eternal world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sing unto the Lord - This is the same expression which occurs in the song of Moses <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-21.htm">Exodus 15:21</a>. Isaiah evidently had that in his eye.<p>He hath done excellent things - Things that are exalted (&#1490;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;  ge&#770;'u&#770;th); that are worthy to be celebrated, and had in remembrance; things that are majestic, grand, and wonderful.<p>This is known in all the earth - Or, more properly, 'Let this be known in all the earth.' It is worthy of being celebrated everywhere. It should be sounded abroad through all lands. This expresses the sincere desire of all who are redeemed, and who are made sensible of the goodness and mercy of God the Saviour. The instinctive and the unceasing wish is, that the wonders of the plan of redeeming mercy should be everywhere known among the nations, and that all flesh should see the salvation of our God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

He has brought in an excellent righteousness, a righteousness that excels any righteousness of the creature, men or angels; it being the righteousness of God, a perfect, pure, and spotless one, which serves for many, even all his spiritual seed, and is everlasting: he has offered up an excellent sacrifice, a sacrifice that excels all that were offered up under the law; in the matter, which is himself; in the use and efficacy of it, to atone for sin, and take it away; in the continuance of that efficacy, and in its acceptableness unto God: and he has obtained an excellent victory over all his and his people's enemies, sin, Satan, the world, and death, and made them sharers in his conquests; reference seems to be had to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1</a>, <p>this is known in all the earth; that such a salvation is finished; such a righteousness is brought in; that peace, pardon, and atonement, are procured, and all enemies are conquered; for the Gospel publishing all this has been sent into all the world, and will be more fully preached throughout it in the latter day. <p>(u)  "canite Jehovam", Cocceius;    Sept. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this is known in all the earth.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">excellent things</span>] “Excellence,” ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-10.htm" title="Let favor be showed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.">Isaiah 26:10</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-1.htm" title="Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song to the LORD, and spoke, saying, I will sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea.">Exodus 15:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">this is known</span>] Better as R.V. <span class="bld">let this be known</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things</span>.

"And Jehovah pronounces the ban upon the sea-tongue of Egypt, and swings His hand over the Euphrates in the glow of His breath, and smites it into seven brooks, and makes it so that men go through in shoes. And there will be a road for the remnant of His people that shall be left, out of Asshur, as it was for Israel in the day of its departure out of the land of Egypt." The two countries of the diaspora mentioned first are Asshur and Egypt. And Jehovah makes a way by His miraculous power for those who are returning out of both and across both. The sea-tongue of Egypt, which runs between Egypt and Arabia, i.e., the Red Sea (sinus Heroopolitanus, according to another figure), He smites with the ban (hecherim, corresponding in meaning to the pouring out of the vial of wrath in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-12.htm">Revelation 16:12</a> -a stronger term than ga&#770;&#8219;ar, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-9.htm">Psalm 106:9</a>); and the consequence of this is, that it affords a dry passage to those who are coming back (though without there being any necessity to read hecher&#305;&#772;b, or to follow Meier and Knobel, who combine hecher&#305;&#772;m with cha&#770;ru&#772;m, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-18.htm">Leviticus 21:18</a>, in the precarious sense of splitting). And in order that the dividing of Jordan may have its antitype also, Jehovah swings His hand over the Euphrates, to smite, breathing upon it at the same time with burning breath, so that it is split up into seven shallow brooks, through which men can walk in sandals. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; stands, according to the law of sound, for &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;; and the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3; &#1506;&#1497;&#1501; (with a fixed kametz), from &#1506;&#1493;&#1501;  equals  &#1495;&#1493;&#1501;, &#1495;&#1502;&#1501;, to glow, signifies a glowing heat - a meaning which is also so thoroughly supported by the two Arabic verbs med. Ye &#8219;lm and glm (inf. &#8219;aim, gaim, internal heat, burning thirst, also violent anger), that there is no need whatever for the conjecture of Luzzatto and Gesenius, &#1489;&#1506;&#1514;&#1505;&#1501;. The early translators (e.g., lxx &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837;, Syr. beuchdono, with a display of might) merely give conjectural renderings of the word, which had become obsolete before their time; Saadia, however, renders it with etymological correctness suchu&#772;n, from sachana, to be hot, or set on fire. Thus, by changing the Euphrates in the (parching) heat of His breath into seven shallow wadys, Jehovah makes a free course for His people who come out of Asshur, etc. This was the idea which presented itself to the prophet in just this shape, though it by no means followed that it must necessarily embody itself in history in this particular form.  </body></html>
