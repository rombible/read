For the prophet is evidently predicting an invasion which was future, and the behaviour of the Jews on that occasion. He is showing beforehand some of the causes of these judgments, namely, the crimes and vices of the people; and first, in these verses, their inconsideration and want of faith. They <span class="ital">would look, </span>he says, <span class="ital">to the armour of the house of the forest </span>— But not to God. The history (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-2.htm" title="And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,">2 Chronicles 32:2</a>, &c.) best explains this passage. From thence we learn, that the prince and the people were rather solicitous to seek for human defence, by fortifying their city, than for that which was divine, by having respect unto him who was their king and protector. <span class="ital">The house of the forest </span>is that mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-2.htm" title="He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars.">1 Kings 7:2</a>, where the armory was kept. See the note there. The prophet proceeds to foretel that they would see, that is, observe or consider, <span class="ital">the breaches of the city of David</span> — Namely, in order to the reparation of them, and to fortify the city; that they would <span class="ital">gather the waters of the lower pool </span>— In order that they might both deprive the enemy of water, and supply the city with it: of which see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/32-3.htm" title="He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help him....">2 Chronicles 32:3-4</a>. That they would number <span class="ital">the houses of Jerusalem </span>— Namely, with a view to know their own strength, and the number of their people, that so they might lay the burdens more equally upon them, and make sufficient provision for them; that they would break <span class="ital">down the houses </span>— Namely, which stood upon or without the walls of their city, and which therefore would have given their enemies advantage against them, and have hindered the fortifying of the city. <span class="ital">But, </span>adds he, <span class="ital">ye have not looked, or will not look, into the maker thereof </span>— That is, of Jerusalem, mentioned in the foregoing verse; <span class="ital">him that fashioned it </span>— Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">ויצרה</span>, <span class="ital">the former, </span>or <span class="ital">framer </span>of it. God, who made it a city, and the place of his special presence and worship; which also he had undertaken to protect, on condition that the people would observe his commands; to whom, therefore, they should have had recourse in this time of their distress. The expression <span class="greekheb">מרחוק</span>, <span class="ital">of old, </span>or <span class="ital">long ago, </span>may be added to aggravate their sin in distrusting that God who had now, for a long time, given proof of his care and kindness in defending that city.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:8-14 The weakness of Judah now appeared more than ever. Now also they discovered their carnal confidence and their carnal security. They looked to the fortifications. They made sure of water for the city. But they were regardless of God in all these preparations. They did not care for his glory in what they did. They did not depend upon him for a blessing on their endeavours. For every creature is to us what God makes it to be; and we must bless him for it, and use it for him. There was great contempt of God's wrath and justice, in contending with them. God's design was to humble them, and bring them to repentance. They walked contrary to this. Actual disbelief of another life after this, is at the bottom of the carnal security and brutish sensuality, which are the sin, the shame, and ruin of so great a part of mankind. God was displeased at this. It is a sin against the remedy, and it is not likely they should ever repent of it. Whether this unbelief works by presumption or despair, it produces the same contempt of God, and is a token that a man will perish wilfully.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he discovered - Hebrew, &#1493;&#1497;&#1490;&#1500;  vayegal - 'He made naked, or bare.' The expression, 'He discovered,' means simply that it "was" uncovered, without designating the agent.<p>The covering of Judah - The word used here (&#1502;&#1505;&#1498;  ma&#770;sak) denotes properly "a covering," and is applied to the "curtain" or veil that was before the tabernacle <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-36.htm">Exodus 26:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-38.htm">Exodus 39:38</a>; and to the curtain that was before the gate of the court <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-17.htm">Exodus 35:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-40.htm">Exodus 39:40</a>.

Many have understood it of the defenses, ramparts, or fortifications of Judah, meaning that they were laid open to public view, that is, were demolished. But the more probable meaning, perhaps, is, that the invading army exposed Judah to every kind of reproach; stripped off everything that was designed to be ornamental in the land; and thus, by the figure of exposing one to reproach and shame by stripping off all his clothes, exposed Judah in every part to reproach. Sennacherib actually came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them and dismantled them <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-1.htm">Isaiah 36:1</a>.

In this house, Solomon laid up large quantities of munitions of war <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-16.htm">1 Kings 10:16-17</a>; and this vast storehouse was now the principal reliance of Hezekiah against the invading forces of Sennacherib. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. he discovered the covering&#8212;rather, "the veil of Judah shall be taken off" [Horsley]: figuratively for, exposing to shame as a captive (Isa 47:3; Na 3:5).

This house of the forest is the same with the house of the forest of Lebanon; so called, not because built in it, for it was in Jerusalem, but because it was built of the wood of Lebanon; or because it was surrounded with trees, and had walks and groves belonging to it, resembling that forest.

O full of tumult, thou noisy city, shouting castle, thy slain men are not slain with the sword, nor slaughtered in battle. All thy rulers departing together are fettered without bow; all thy captured ones are fettered together, fleeing far away." From the flat house-tops they all look out together at the approaching army of the foe, longing for battle, and sure of victory (culla&#770;k is for culle&#772;k, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-29.htm">Isaiah 14:29</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a>).

How terribly they deceive themselves! Not even the honour of falling upon the battle-field is allowed them. Their rulers (ka&#770;tzin, a judge, and then any person of rank) depart one and all out of the city, and are fettered outside "without bow" (mikkesheth), i.e., without there being any necessity for the bow to be drawn (min, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-9.htm">Job 21:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-22.htm">2 Samuel 1:22</a>; cf., Ewald, 217, b). All, without exception, of those who are attacked in Jerusalem by the advancing foe (nimza&#770;'aik, thy captured ones, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-15.htm">Isaiah 13:15</a>), fall helplessly into captivity, as they are attempting to flee far away (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>; the perf. de conatu answers to the classical praesens de conatu). Hence (what is here affirmed indirectly) the city is besieged, and in consequence of the long siege hunger and pestilence destroy the inhabitants, and every one who attempts to get away falls into the hands of the enemy, without venturing to defend himself, on account of his emaciation and exhaustion from hunger. Whilst the prophet thus pictures to himself the fate of Jerusalem and Judah, through their infatuation, he is seized with inconsolable anguish. </body></html>
