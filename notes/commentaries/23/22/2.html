Or, perhaps, this whole description may mean that it was formerly a city distinguished for the hum of business, or for pleasure; a busy, active, enterprising city. The Hebrew will bear this, but I prefer the former interpretation, as indicating mingled alarm and consternation, and at the same time a disposition to engage in riot and revelry.<p>A joyous city - A city exulting; rejoicing; given to pleasure, and to riot. (See the description of Nineveh in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-15.htm">Zephaniah 2:15</a>) It is remarkable that the prophet has blended these things together, and has spoken of the tumult, the alarm, and the rejoicing, in the same breath. 'This may be either because it was the "general" character of the city thus to be full of revelry, dissipation, and riot, and he designates it by that which "usually and appropriately" described it; or because it was, even then, notwithstanding the general consternation and alarm, given up to revelry, and the rather on account of the approaching danger. So he describes the city in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-12.htm">Isaiah 22:12-13</a>.<p>Thy slain men are not slain with the sword - The words 'thy slain' here (&#1495;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;  cha&#774;la&#770;layika&#772;), seem to be intended to be applied to the soldiers on whom the defense of the city rested; and to mean those who had not died an honorable death "in" the city in its defense, but who had "fled" in consternation, and who were either taken in their flight and made captive, or who were pursued and put to death. To be slain with the sword here is equivalent to being slain in an honorable engagement with the enemy. But here the prophet speaks of their consternation, their cowardice, and of their being partly trampled down in their hasty and ignominious flight by each other; and partly of the fugitives being overtaken by the enemy, and thus put to death. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. art&#8212;rather, "wert"; for it could not now be said to be "a joyous city" (Isa 32:13). The cause of their joy (Isa 22:13) may have been because Sennacherib had accepted Hezekiah's offer to renew the payment of tribute, and they were glad to have peace on any terms, however humiliating (2Ki 18:14-16), or on account of the alliance with Egypt. If the reference be to Zedekiah's time, the joy and feasting are not inapplicable, for this recklessness was a general characteristic of the unbelieving Jews (Isa 56:12).<p>not slain with the sword&#8212;but with the famine and pestilence about to be caused by the coming siege (La 4:9). Maurer refers this to the plague by which he thinks Sennacherib's army was destroyed, and Hezekiah was made sick (Isa 37:36; 38:1). But there is no authority for supposing that the Jews in the city suffered such extremities of plague at this time, when God destroyed their foes. Barnes refers it to those slain in flight, not in open honorable "battle"; Isa 22:3 favors this.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou art full of stirs; </span> or, thou who wast full of stirs, or noises, to wit, of joyful shouts, as the following words limit it, and as this word is used, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-7.htm" title="Who are you, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace to it.">Zechariah 4:7</a></span>, though elsewhere it be taken for doleful cries. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Tumultuous; </span> or, <span class="ital">streperous</span>; full of noise and clamour, through revelling and jollity.

Or, "wast full of stirs"; through the multitude of people walking about in it, and the vast hurry of business done in it; but now all hush and quiet, the streets clear of people, and the shops shut up, and all got up to the housetops for shelter; or, "full of noises" (l), as a populous trading city is.

Some critics, however, take this clause and the next verse as the description of a vision which the prophet has of the future.

Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 135, II. 15-18). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The heading &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489; &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; (the &#1506; written according to the best codd. with a simple sheva), when pointed as we have it, signifies, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-1.htm">Zechariah 9:1</a> (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>), "oracle against Arabia." But why not massa&#770; &#8219;Ara&#770;b, since massa&#770; is followed by a simple genitive in the other three headings? Or again, is this the only heading in the tetralogy that is not symbolical? We must assume that the Beth by which this is distinguished is introduced for the express purpose of rendering it symbolical, and that the prophet pointed it first of all &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, but had at the same time &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489; in his mind. The earlier translators (lxx, Targum, Syr., Vulg., Ar.) read the second &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489; like the first, but without any reason. The oracle commences with an evening scene, even without our altering the second &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;. And the massa has a symbolical title founded upon this evening scene. Just as 'Edom becomes Dumah, inasmuch as a night without a morning dawn falls upon the mountain land of Seir, so will &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489; soon be &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, inasmuch as the sun of Arabia is setting. Evening darkness is settling upon Arabia, and the morning-land is becoming an evening-land. "In the wilderness in Arabia ye must pass the night, caravans of the Dedanians. Bring water to meet thirsty ones! The inhabitants of the land of Tema are coming with its bread before the fugitive. For they are flying before swords, before drawn swords, and before a bent bow, and before oppressive war." There is all the less ground for making any alteration in &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506;&#1512;, inasmuch as the second Beth (wilderness in Arabia for of Arabia) is favoured by Isaiah's common usage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-21.htm">Isaiah 28:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-21.htm">2 Samuel 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-9.htm">Amos 3:9</a>). &#8219;Arab, written with pathach, is Arabia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-21.htm">Ezekiel 27:21</a>; &#8219;ara&#770;b in pause, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-24.htm">Jeremiah 25:24</a>); and ya&#8219;ar here is the solitary barren desert, as distinguished from the cultivated land with its cities and villages. Wetzstein rejects the meaning nemus, sylva, with ya&#8219;ar has been assumed to have, because it would be rather a promise than a threat to be told that they would have to flee from the steppe into the wood, since a shady tree is the most delicious dream of the Beduins, who not only find shade in the forest, but a constant supply of green pasture, and fuel for their hospitable hearths. He therefore renders it, "Ye will take refuge in the V&#8219;ar of Arabia," i.e., the open steppe will no longer afford you any shelter, so that ye will be obliged to hide yourselves in the V&#8219;ar. Arab. wa&#8219;ur for example, is the name applied to the trachytic rayon of the Syro-Hauranitic volcanoes which is covered with a layer of stones. But as the V&#8219;ar in this sense is also planted with trees, and furnishes firewood, this epithet must rest upon some peculiar distinction in the radical meaning of the word ya&#8219;ar, which really does mean a forest in Hebrew, though not necessarily a forest of lofty trees, but also a wilderness overgrown with brushwood and thorn-bushes. The meaning of the passage before us we therefore take to be this: the trading caravans ('a&#770;rcho&#772;th, like hail&#305;&#772;coth in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-19.htm">Job 6:19</a>) of the Dedanians, that mixed tribe of Cushites and Abrahamides dwelling in the neighbourhood of the Edomites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-3.htm">Genesis 25:3</a>), when on their way from east to west, possibly to Tyre (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-20.htm">Ezekiel 27:20</a>), would be obliged to encamp in the wilderness, being driven out of the caravan road in consequence of the war that was spreading from north to south. The prophet, whose sympathy mingles with the revelation in this instance also, asks for water for the panting fugitives (&#1492;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-9.htm">Jeremiah 12:9</a>, an imperative equivalent to &#1492;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;  equals  &#1492;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-3.htm">2 Kings 2:3</a> : there is no necessity to read &#1511;&#1491;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;, as the Targum, Dderlein, and Ewald do). They are driven back with fright towards the south-east as far as Tema, on the border of Negd and the Syrian desert. The Tema referred to is not the trans-Hauranian Tm, which is three-quarters of an hour from Dumah, although there is a good deal that seems to favour this,<p>(Note: See Wetzstein, ut supra, p. 202; compare Job, ii.425.)<p>but the Tema on the pilgrim road from Damascus to Mecca, between Tebuk and Wadi el-Kora, which is about the same distance (four days' journey) from both these places, and also from Chaibar (it is to be distinguished, however, from Tihama, the coast land of Yemen, the antithesis of which is ne'gd, the mountain district of Yemen).<p>(Note: See Sprenger, Post und Reise-routen des Orients, Heft i.((1864), pp. 118, 119.))<p>But even here in the land of Tema they do not feel themselves safe. The inhabitants of Tema are obliged to bring them water and bread ("its bread," lachmo, referring to no&#772;de&#772;d: the bread necessary in order to save them), into the hiding-places in which they have concealed themselves. "How humiliating," as Drechsler well observes, "to be obliged to practise their hospitality, the pride of Arabian customs, in so restricted a manner, and with such unbecoming secrecy!" But it could not possibly be done in any other way, since the weapons of the foe were driving them incessantly before them, and the war itself was rolling incessantly forward like an overwhelming colossus, as the repetition of the word "before" (mippene&#772;) no less than four times clearly implies. </body></html>
