Dross may shine like silver, and the wine that is mixed with water may still have the colour of wine. Those have a great deal to answer for, who do not help the oppressed, but oppress them. Men may do much by outward restraints; but only God works effectually by the influences of his Spirit, as a Spirit of Judgment. Sin is the worst captivity, the worst slavery. The redemption of the spiritual Zion, by the righteousness and death of Christ, and by his powerful grace, most fully accord with what is here meant. Utter ruin is threatened. The Jews should become as a tree when blasted by heat; as a garden without water, which in those hot countries would soon be burned up. Thus shall they be that trust in idols, or in an arm of flesh. Even the strong man shall be as tow; not only soon broken, and pulled to pieces, but easily catching fire. When the sinner has made himself as tow and stubble, and God makes himself as a consuming fire, what can prevent the utter ruin of the sinner?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I will restore ... - That is, I will give you such judges as the nation had in former days - in the times of Moses, Joshua, etc. Most of the charges in this chapter are against the magistrates. The calamities of the nation are traced to their unfaithfulness and corruption, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17-23</a>. God now says that he will remove this cause of their calamity, and give them pure magistrates.<p>Thy counselors - Thy advisers; that is, those occupying places of trust and responsibility. When this should be, the prophet does not say. The Jewish commentators suppose that he refers to the time after the return from captivity, and to such men as Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah; and to the times of Hyrcanus and Herod, Jerome supposes that the times of the Messiah are referred to. It is impossible to determine which is the correct opinion; though, as the Babylonian captivity was the punishment of those national sins which the prophet was denouncing, it is more probable that he refers to the time immediately succeeding that punishment, when the nation would be restored. I am inclined, therefore, to the opinion, that the prophet had reference solely to the prosperity of the Jewish nation, under a succession of comparatively virtuous princes, after the Babylonian captivity.<p>Thou shalt be called ... - The principal cause of your wickedness and calamity, that is, your unfaithful rulers being removed and punished, you shall afterward be distinguished as a city of righteousness.<p>The faithful city - That is, faithful to Yahweh - faithful in keeping his laws, and maintaining the rites of his religion as formerly; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26.

This refers not to the times after the Babylonish, captivity, when the Jews had judges and rulers, such as Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, as they had in the times of Moses, Joshua, and the judges, or as in the times of David and Solomon; but it refers, as Kimchi observes, to the times of the Messiah; and is true of the apostles of Christ, who were set on twelve thrones, had power and authority from Christ to preach his Gospel, and to judge the twelve tribes of Israel in a doctrinal way, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a> for which they were abundantly qualified, having the spirit of counsel and of judgment resting upon them, as the prophets of old; and will be again verified in the ministers of the Gospel, at the time of the Jews' conversion, when the watchmen shall see eye to eye, have a clear discerning and judgment of things as at the first, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8</a>. <p>and thy counsellors as at the beginning; which is to be understood of the same persons; the apostles at Jerusalem gave advice and counsel in matters of difficulty, and were consulted on special occasions, of which there is an instance in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1</a> and ordinary ministers of the word are qualified, and especially will be in the latter day, to give advice both to sensible sinners, inquiring the way of salvation, and to saints when under desertion, and have lost their beloved, or have any matters of difficulty upon them, whether with respect to faith or practice. <p>Afterward thou shall be called the city of righteousness: when many shall be converted through the hand of the Lord turned upon them, and become incorporated into a church state, and having the apostles and other ministers of the Gospel among them, with proper officers over them, as the first Christian church at Jerusalem had; and the members of it were righteous persons, such as were justified by the righteousness of Christ, and lived righteously, walking in the ordinances of the Lord, and as became the Gospel of Christ, and will be the case of the churches of Christ in the latter day: <p>the faithful city; to Christ, his Gospel, ordinances, and one another, as the first Christians at Jerusalem were; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-12.htm">Acts 2:12</a>. A true church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men, who keep the ordinances as they were delivered; stand first in the faith of the Gospel; take care that the laws of Christ's house are put in execution; and do not suffer sin upon one another, nor bear them that are evil, whether in doctrine or practice; and which in the latter day will be the case of the churches of Christ in a remarkable manner, when they will justly bear this character. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{l}</span> And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.</span><p>(l) It is once the work of God to purify the heart of man, which he does because of his promise, made concerning the salvation of his Church.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">26</span>. The result will be the establishment of a pure administration in Jerusalem, as in the olden time, Zion once more worthy of her ancient name, <span class="bld">citadel of righteousness</span> (Cheyne), <span class="bld">faithful city</span>. The last expression, carrying us back to <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-21.htm" title="How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.">Isaiah 1:21</a></span>, marks the close of the elegy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Two things are noteworthy in this passage. (1) The ideal is political. The salvation of Israel is secured when all public offices are filled with good men (“judges” and “counsellers”). (2) The ideal will be realised by a restoration of the best days of the past. In later prophecies Isaiah looks forward to a state of things far transcending anything that had been achieved in Israel’s previous history. Such an anticipation as this is most naturally assigned to an early period of his career, before his eschatological conceptions had assumed a definite form.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">27</span> describes the salutary and <span class="bld">28</span> the judicial aspect of the chastisement in more abstract terms than those hitherto employed. <span class="ital">her converts</span>] lit. “those in her who turn”; cf. “Remnant-shall-turn” in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-3.htm" title="Then said the LORD to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shearjashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;">Isaiah 7:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">redeemed</span>] A very rare word with Isaiah (only again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-22.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.">Isaiah 29:22</a>). It is doubtful whether the meaning is that she shall be redeemed from her own sins, or from the troubles they shall have brought upon her. So it is uncertain whether <span class="ital">judgment</span> and <span class="ital">righteousness</span> (cf. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-21.htm" title="How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.">Isaiah 1:21</a></span>) are the virtues of the redeemed people, or the attributes of God manifested in the redemption. The former idea is most in accordance with Isaiah’s use of the words, but the latter, which is common in the later parts of the book, undoubtedly gives the best sense in this connexion.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will restore thy judges as at the first</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-25.htm">Exodus 19:25</a>, 26). In the early times there was no bribery, no perversion of justice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2, 3</a>). God will bring back a time when the nation will renew its first love, and be as it was in the days of Moses and Joshua. <span class="cmt_word">Thy counselors</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-12.htm">2 Samuel 15:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-14.htm">1 Chronicles 26:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-32.htm">1 Chronicles 27:32, 33</a>,  etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The city of righteousness</span>; or, <span class="accented">of justice</span>. The prophecy may have been fulfilled in part by the earthly Jerusalem under Zerubhabel, Ezra, and the Maccabees. but is mainly fulfilled in the heavenly Jerusalem  - the Church of God, the true Israel. <span class="cmt_word">The faithful city</span> (comp. ver. 21). Certainly the post-Captivity Church was "faithful" to Jehovah, in the way of acknowledging him, and him only, to be God, to a very remarkable degree, and in strong contrast to its inclination during pro-Captivity times. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But after the restoration of Israel in integrum by this act of grace, the rest would unquestionably depend upon the conduct of Israel itself. According to Israel's own decision would Jehovah determine Israel's future. "If ye then shall willingly hear, ye shall eat the good of the land; if ye shall obstinately rebel, ye shall be eaten by the sword: for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it." After their justification, both blessing and cursing lay once more before the justified, as they had both been long before proclaimed by the law (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-19.htm">Isaiah 1:19</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-3.htm">Deuteronomy 28:3</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-3.htm">Leviticus 26:3</a>., and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-20.htm">Isaiah 1:20</a> with the threat of vengeance with the sword in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25</a>). The promise of eating, i.e., of the full enjoyment of domestic blessings, and therefore of settled, peaceful rest at home, is placed in contrast with the curse of being eaten with the sword. Chereb (the sword) is the accusative of the instrument, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/17-13.htm">Psalm 17:13-14</a>; but this adverbial construction without either genitive, adjective, or suffix, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-20.htm">Exodus 30:20</a>, is very rarely met with (Ges. 138, Anm. 3); and in the passage before us it is a bold construction which the prophet allows himself, instead of saying, &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1499;&#1501;, for the sake of the paronomasia (Bttcher, Collectanea, p. 161). In the conditional clauses the two futures are followed by two preterites (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-21.htm">Leviticus 26:21</a>, which is more in conformity with our western mode of expression), inasmuch as obeying and rebelling are both of them consequences of an act of will: if ye shall be willing, and in consequence of this obey; if ye shall refuse, and rebel against Jehovah. They are therefore, strictly speaking, perfecta consecutiva. According to the ancient mode of writing, the passage <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18-20</a> formed a separate parashah by themselves, viz., a sethumah, or parashah indicated by spaces left within the line. The piskah after <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-20.htm">Isaiah 1:20</a> corresponds to a long pause in the mind of the speaker. - Will Israel tread the saving path of forgiveness thus opened before it, and go on to renewed obedience, and will it be possible for it to be brought back by this path? Individuals possibly may, but not the whole. The divine appeal therefore changes now into a mournful complaint. So peaceful a solution as this of the discord between Jehovah and His children was not to be hoped for. Jerusalem was far too depraved. </body></html>
