Of the former we have instances in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-14.htm" title="I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.">Psalm 81:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-8.htm" title="And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holds the scepter from Ashkelon, and I will turn my hand against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, said the Lord GOD.">Amos 1:8</a>; of the latter in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-7.htm" title="Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, said the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn my hand on the little ones.">Zechariah 13:7</a>. The context here inclines to the latter meaning. Jehovah punishes that He may save, and smites that He may heal.<p><span class= "bld">Purely purge away thy dross.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">will smelt away thy dross with lye, </span>or <span class= "ital">potash, </span>which was used in the smelting process. The imagery of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-22.htm" title="Your silver is become dross, your wine mixed with water:">Isaiah 1:22</a> is resumed. The great Refiner can purify the debased metal. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/malachi/3-2.htm" title="But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appears? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:">Malachi 3:2-3</a>, we have the same image expanded. The process involved, of course, the rejection of the dross—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in the interpretation of the parable, of the lead that <span class= "ital">would </span>not let itself be turned to silver.<p><span class= "bld">Tin.</span>—Better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">lead. </span>In either case Isaiah’s knowledge of metallurgy was probably due to intercourse with the Phœnicians, who brought both lead and tin from Tarshish (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Spain).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/1-25.htm" title="And I will turn my hand on you, and purely purge away your dross, and take away all your tin:...">Isaiah 1:25-26</a></span>. <span class="ital">And I will turn my hand upon thee </span>— I will chastise thee again, and thereby reform thee: or, I will do that for the reviving of religion, which I did at first for the planting of it. <span class="ital">And purge away thy dross</span> — I will purge out of thee those wicked men that are incorrigible, and, as for those of you that are curable, I will by my word, and by the furnace of affliction, purge out all that corruption that yet remains in you. <span class="ital">And I will restore thy judges, </span>&c. — I will give thee such princes and magistrates as thou hadst <span class="ital">in the beginning, </span>either, 1st, Of thy commonwealth, such as Moses and Joshua: or, 2d, Of thy kingdom, such as David. <span class="ital">And thy counsellors </span>— Thy princes shall have, and shall hearken to, wise and faithful counsellors. <span class="ital">Afterward thou shalt be called </span>— Namely, justly and truly, <span class="ital">the city of righteousness, </span>&c. — Thou shalt be such. “The reforming of the magistracy,” says Henry, “is a good step toward the reforming of the city and country too.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:21-31 Neither holy cities nor royal ones are faithful to their trust, if religion does not dwell in them. Dross may shine like silver, and the wine that is mixed with water may still have the colour of wine. Those have a great deal to answer for, who do not help the oppressed, but oppress them. Men may do much by outward restraints; but only God works effectually by the influences of his Spirit, as a Spirit of Judgment. Sin is the worst captivity, the worst slavery. The redemption of the spiritual Zion, by the righteousness and death of Christ, and by his powerful grace, most fully accord with what is here meant. Utter ruin is threatened. The Jews should become as a tree when blasted by heat; as a garden without water, which in those hot countries would soon be burned up. Thus shall they be that trust in idols, or in an arm of flesh. Even the strong man shall be as tow; not only soon broken, and pulled to pieces, but easily catching fire. When the sinner has made himself as tow and stubble, and God makes himself as a consuming fire, what can prevent the utter ruin of the sinner?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I will turn my hand upon thee - This expression is capable of two significations. The hand may be stretched out for two purposes, either to inflict punishment, or to afford help and protection. The phrase here refers evidently to the latter, to the act of redeeming and restoring his people, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26-27</a>. The idea may be thus expressed: 'I will stretch out my hand to punish my enemies <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>, and will turn my hand upon thee for protection, and recovery.'<p>Purge away - This refers to the process of smelting, or purifying metals in the fire. It means, I will remove all the dross which has accumulated <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22</a>, and will make the silver pure. This was commonly done by fire; and the idea is, that he would render his own people pure by those judgments which would destroy his enemies who were intermingled with them.<p>Purely - The original word here - &#1499;&#1489;&#1512;  kabor - has been commonly understood to mean, according to purity; that is, effectually or entirely pure. Thus it is translated by the Septuagint, and by the Latin Vulgate. But by the Chaldee it is translated, 'I will purify thee as with the herb borith.' The word may mean lye, alkali, or potash, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-30.htm">Job 9:30</a>; and it may mean also borax - a substance formed of alkali and boracic acid, much used in purifying metals. The essential idea is, I will make you effectually, or entirely pure.<p>Thy tin - Tin is with us a well-known white metal. But the word used here does not mean tin. It denotes the stannum of the ancients; a metal formed of lead mixed with silver ore. Here it means, I will take away all the impure metal mixed with thee; varying the idea but little from the former part of the verse. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. turn &#8230; hand&#8212;not in wrath, but in grace (Zec 13:7), "upon thee," as Isa 1:26, 27 show; contrasted with the enemies, of whom He will avenge Himself (Isa 1:24).<p>purely&#8212;literally, "as alkali purifies."<p>thy dross&#8212;not thy sins, but the sinful persons (Jer 6:29); "enemies" (Isa 1:24); degenerate princes (see on [689]Isa 1:22), intermingled with the elect "remnant" of grace.<p>tin&#8212;Hebrew, bedil, here the alloy of lead, tin, &c., separated by smelting from the silver.

The remnant, according to the election of grace, left in Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a> meaning not his afflicting hand, no, not even as a fatherly chastisement; though the Lord sometimes, by such means, purges away the iniquity of his people, as follows; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-9.htm">Isaiah 27:9</a> much less his hand of wrath and vengeance, the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger; but his hand of efficacious grace in conversion, with which he plucks sinners as brands out of the burning; delivers them from the power of Satan; turns their hearts to himself; opens them, to attend unto and understand divine things; breaks them in pieces with the hammer of his word; works grace in them, and carries on the good work in their souls: all which is owing to his mighty hand of grace upon them, and to the exertions of the exceeding greatness of his power towards them. This was accomplished in part in the conversion of a large number of the Jews on the day of Pentecost, and afterwards; and will be more fully accomplished in the latter day, when that people shall turn to the Lord, in consequence of his hand of powerful grace being turned on them. The phrase is used of the display of divine grace and mercy, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>. <p>and purely purge away thy dross; which the Targum rightly interprets of "ungodliness" or wickedness; it means the sins of converted ones, which, at conversion, they are purely purged from; not that sin, as to the being of it, is removed from them; that dwells in them, abides with them; and, like dross, is a heavy burden, a dead weight upon them, and will be while they are in this tabernacle, and makes them groan, being burdened; so far from it, that in their view it rather increases; they see the plague of their own hearts; and such innumerable swarms of corruption they never saw before; sin revives, and they die; but in conversion grace superabounds it, deluges over it, keeps down the force and power of it, so that it has not the dominion; the old man is put off concerning the former conversation, which ceases to be a series, a course of sinning: besides, through the sprinkling of the blood of Christ, which cleanseth from all the dross and filth of sin, the guilt is removed from the conscience, and perfect peace and full pardon take place; all iniquity is caused to pass from them, and they are clothed with change of raiment, the righteousness of Christ, by which they are justified from all things, and are pure, spotless, and without fault before the throne: <p>and take away all thy tin. The Targum also interprets this of iniquity, rendering it, "I will take away all thy sin"; but it is better to understand it of self-righteousness; which, as tin is of more worth than dross, and looks like silver; so this has the appearance of some good in it, and was what the Jews were fond of, trusted in, and depended on, and which they followed after, and endeavoured to establish and hold fast; but this in conversion is all taken away: the Lord, by his Spirit; convinces of the weakness and insufficiency of it, to justify in his sight; shows that it is not a righteousness, and will be of no service in that respect; yea, takes away these filthy rags, and clothes with the righteousness of Christ; causes the soul to drop and renounce its own righteousness, and put on that; and not only to renounce works before conversion, but all after it, as a profession of religion, subjection to Gospel ordinances, and all works, though done in faith, and in a right manner; a glaring instance we have of all this in one of that little remnant, the Apostle Paul, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-6.htm">Philippians 3:6</a>. Moreover, by "dross" and "tin", or "tins", in the plural number, may be meant persons; wicked and profane men, by the former, who should be put away like dross, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-119.htm">Psalm 119:119</a> and self righteous persons, by the latter; who shine like silver, make a show of religion, appear outwardly righteous; but these, as well as the other, should be separated from the people of God, when the precious and the vile should be distinguished. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I will turn my hand upon thee, and thoroughly purge away thy dross, <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> and take away all thy tin:</span><p>(k) Lest the faithful among them should be overcome with his threatening he adds this consolation.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will turn my hand upon thee</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">will bring back my hand upon thee</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I will once more put forth the "strong hand and mighty arm, with which I brought thee out of Egypt" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-12.htm">Psalm 136:12</a>), and will work another deliverance - the deliverance of Israel out of captivity. <span class="cmt_word">Purely purge away thy dross</span>; literally, <span class="accented">will purge away thy dross like borax</span>, which was used as a flux in purifying the metal.

According to Israel's own decision would Jehovah determine Israel's future. "If ye then shall willingly hear, ye shall eat the good of the land; if ye shall obstinately rebel, ye shall be eaten by the sword: for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it." After their justification, both blessing and cursing lay once more before the justified, as they had both been long before proclaimed by the law (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-19.htm">Isaiah 1:19</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-3.htm">Deuteronomy 28:3</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-3.htm">Leviticus 26:3</a>., and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-20.htm">Isaiah 1:20</a> with the threat of vengeance with the sword in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25</a>). The promise of eating, i.e., of the full enjoyment of domestic blessings, and therefore of settled, peaceful rest at home, is placed in contrast with the curse of being eaten with the sword. Chereb (the sword) is the accusative of the instrument, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/17-13.htm">Psalm 17:13-14</a>; but this adverbial construction without either genitive, adjective, or suffix, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-20.htm">Exodus 30:20</a>, is very rarely met with (Ges. 138, Anm. 3); and in the passage before us it is a bold construction which the prophet allows himself, instead of saying, &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1499;&#1501;, for the sake of the paronomasia (Bttcher, Collectanea, p. 161). In the conditional clauses the two futures are followed by two preterites (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-21.htm">Leviticus 26:21</a>, which is more in conformity with our western mode of expression), inasmuch as obeying and rebelling are both of them consequences of an act of will: if ye shall be willing, and in consequence of this obey; if ye shall refuse, and rebel against Jehovah. They are therefore, strictly speaking, perfecta consecutiva. According to the ancient mode of writing, the passage <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18-20</a> formed a separate parashah by themselves, viz., a sethumah, or parashah indicated by spaces left within the line. The piskah after <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-20.htm">Isaiah 1:20</a> corresponds to a long pause in the mind of the speaker. - Will Israel tread the saving path of forgiveness thus opened before it, and go on to renewed obedience, and will it be possible for it to be brought back by this path? Individuals possibly may, but not the whole. The divine appeal therefore changes now into a mournful complaint. So peaceful a solution as this of the discord between Jehovah and His children was not to be hoped for. Jerusalem was far too depraved. </body></html>
