Both words point to the dyes of Tyre, and the words probably received a fresh emphasis from the fact that robes of these colours were worn by the princes to whom Isaiah preached (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-24.htm" title="You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold on your apparel.">2Samuel 1:24</a>). To the prophet’s eye that dark crimson was as the stain of blood. What Jehovah promises is that the guilt of the past, deep-dyed in grain as it might be, should be discharged, and leave the character with a restored purity. Men might dye their souls of this or that hue, but to bleach them was the work of God. He alone could <span class= "ital">transfigure </span>them that they should be “white as snow” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-3.htm" title="And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.">Mark 9:3</a>).

But, blessed be God, there is a Fountain opened, in which sinners of every age and rank may be cleansed. Though our sins have been as scarlet and crimson, a deep dye, a double dye, first in the wool of original corruption, and afterwards in the many threads of actual transgression; though we have often dipped into sin, by many backslidings; yet pardoning mercy will take out the stain, Ps 51:7.

It is a solemn act on the part of God, submitting the claims and principles of his government to reason, on the supposition that men may see the propriety of his service, and of his plan.<p>Let us reason together - &#1493;&#1504;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1492;  veniva&#772;kecha&#770;h from &#1497;&#1499;&#1495;  ya&#770;kach, not used in Kal, but in Hiphil; meaning to show, to prove. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a> : 'Surely I will prove my ways (righteous) before him;' that is, I will justify my ways before him.

Here it denotes the kind of contention, or argumentation, which occurs in a court of justice, where the parties reciprocally state the grounds of their cause. God had been addressing magistrates particularly, and commanding them to seek judgment, to relieve the oppressed, to do justice to the orphan and widow; all of which terms are taken from courts of law. He here continues the language, and addresses them as accustomed to the proceedings of courts, and proposes to submit the case as if on trial. He then proceeds <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18-20</a>, to adduce the principles on which he is willing to bestow pardon on them; and submits the case to them, assured that those principles will commend themselves to their reason and sober judgment.<p>Though your sins be as scarlet - The word used here - &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;  sha&#772;n&#305;&#770;ym - denotes properly a bright red color, much prized by the ancients. The Arabic verb means to shine, and the name was given to this color, it is supposed by some, on account of its splendor, or bright appearance. It is mentioned as a merit of Saul, that he clothed the daughters of Israel in scarlet, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-24.htm">2 Samuel 1:24</a>, Our word scarlet, denoting a bright red, expresses the color intended here. This color was obtained from the eggs of the coccus ilicis, a small insect found on the leaves of the oak in Spain, and in the countries east of the Mediterranean. The cotton cloth was dipped in this color twice; and the word used to express it means also double-dyed, from the verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;  sha&#770;na&#770;h, to repeat. From this double-dying many critics have supposed that the name given to the color was derived. The interpretation which derives it from the sense of the Arabic word to shine, however, is the most probable, as there is no evidence that the double-dying was unique to this color. It was a more permanent color than that which is mentioned under the word crimson. White is an emblem of innocence. Of course sins would be represented by the opposite. Hence, we speak of crimes as black, or deep-dyed, and of the soul as stained by sin. There is another idea here. This was a fast, or fixed color. Neither dew, nor rain, nor washing, nor long usage, would remove it. Hence, it is used to represent the fixedness and permanency of sins in the heart. No human means will wash them out. No effort of man, no external rites, no tears, no sacrifices, no prayers, are of themselves sufficient to take them away. They are deep fixed in the heart, as the scarlet color was in the Web of cloth, and an almighty power is needful to remove them.<p>Shall be as white as snow - That is, the deep, fixed stain, which no human power could remove, shall be taken away. In other words, sin shall be pardoned, and the soul be made pure. White, in all ages, has been the emblem of innocence, or purity; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-14.htm">Psalm 68:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-3.htm">Matthew 28:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-13.htm">Revelation 7:13</a>.<p>Though they be red - The idea here is not materially different from that expressed in the former part of the verse. It is the Hebrew poetic form of expressing substantially the same thought in both parts of the sentence. Perhaps, also, it denotes intensity, by being repeated; see Introduction, 8.<p>Like crimson - &#1499;&#1514;&#1493;&#1500;&#1506;  kato&#770;la&#770;&#8219;. The difference between scarlet and crimson is, that the former denotes a deep red; the latter a deco red slightly tinged with blue. Perhaps this difference, however, is not marked in the original. The purple or crimson color was obtained commonly from a shellfish, called murex, or purpura, which abounded chiefly in the sea, near Tyre; and hence, the Tyrian dye became so celebrated. That, however, which is designated in this place, was obtained, not from a shellfish, but a worm (Hebrew: &#1514;&#1493;&#1500;&#1506;  to&#770;la&#770;&#8219;, snail, or conchylium - the Helix Janthina of Linnaeus.  This color was less permanent than the scarlet; was of a bluish east; and is commonly in the English Bible rendered blue. It was employed usually to dye wool, and was used in the construction of the tabernacle, and in the garments of the high priest. It was also in great demand by princes and great men, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-19.htm">Luke 14:19</a>. The prophet has adverted to the fact that it was employed mainly in dying wool, by what he has added, 'shall be as wool.'<p>As wool - That is, as wool undyed, or from which the color is removed. Though your sins appear as deep-stained, and as permanent as the fast color of crimson in wool, yet they shall be removed - as if that stain should be taken away from the wool, and it should be restored to its original whiteness. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. God deigns to argue the case with us, that all may see the just, nay, loving principle of His dealings with men (Isa 43:26).<p>scarlet&#8212;the color of Jesus Christ's robe when bearing our "sins" (Mt 27:28). So Rahab's thread (Jos 2:18; compare Le 14:4). The rabbins say that when the lot used to be taken, a scarlet fillet was bound on the scapegoat's head, and after the high priest had confessed his and the people's sins over it, the fillet became white: the miracle ceased, according to them, forty years before the destruction of Jerusalem, that is, exactly when Jesus Christ was crucified; a remarkable admission of adversaries. Hebrew for "scarlet" radically means double-dyed; so the deep-fixed permanency of sin in the heart, which no mere tears can wash away.<p>snow&#8212;(Ps 51:7). Repentance is presupposed, before sin can be made white as snow (Isa 1:19, 20); it too is God's gift (Jer 31:18, Lam 5:21, Acts 5:31).<p>red&#8212;refers to "blood" (Isa 1:15).<p>as wool&#8212;restored to its original undyed whiteness. This verse shows that the old fathers did not look only for transitory promises (Article VII, Book of Common Prayer). For sins of ignorance, and such like, alone had trespass offerings appointed for them; greater guilt therefore needed a greater sacrifice, for, "without shedding of blood there was no remission"; but none such was appointed, and yet forgiveness was promised and expected; therefore spiritual Jews must have looked for the One Mediator of both Old Testament and New Testament, though dimly understood.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Come now, and let us reason together; </span> I am willing to lay aside my prerogative, and to submit the matter to a fair and equal trial, whether I do not deal justly in rejecting all your services, which are accompanied with such gross hypocrisy and wickedness, and whether I do not deal very graciously in offering mercy and pardon to you upon these conditions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Though your sins be as scarlet, </span> red and bloody, as theirs were, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-15.htm" title="And when you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you: yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.">Isaiah 1:15</a></span>, great and heinous, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">they shall be as white as snow; </span> they shall be washed and purged by the blood of the Messias, whereby you shall be made white and pure in God’s sight.

These words stand not in connection either with the preceding or following, but are to be read in a parenthesis, and are thrown in for the sake of the small remnant God had left among this wicked people, in order to comfort them, being distressed with sin. These, seeing their sins in their dreadful colours, and with all their aggravating circumstances, were ready to conclude that they were unpardonable; and, seeing God as an angry Judge, dared not come nigh him, but stood at a distance, fearing and expecting his vengeance to fall upon them, and therefore put away the promises, and refused to be comforted; when the Lord was pleased to encourage them to draw near to him, and come and reason with him: not at the bar of his justice; there is no reasoning with him there; none can contend with him, or answer him, one of a thousand; if he marks iniquity in strict justice, none can stand before him; there is no entering the lists with him upon the foot of justice, or at its bar: but at the bar of mercy, at the throne of grace; there the righteous may dispute with him from his declarations and promises, as well as come with boldness to him; and at the altar and sacrifice of Christ, and at the fountain of his blood: here sinners may reason with him from the virtue and efficacy of his blood and sacrifice; and from the Lord's proclamation of grace and mercy through him; and from his promises to forgive repenting and confessing sinners: and here God reasons with sensible souls from his own covenant promises and proclamations to forgive sin; from the aboundings of his grace over abounding sin; from the righteousness of Christ to justify, his blood to cleanse from sin, and his sacrifice to atone for it; and from the end of his coming into the world to save the chief of sinners: saying, <p>though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. Every sin is a transgression of the law, and hateful and abominable to God; no sin is venial in itself, but deserving of the wrath of God, and the curses of the law; all sin is mortal, the wages of it is death: but all are not alike; some are greater, others lesser; some are attended with aggravating circumstances, as when the persons that commit them have, besides the light of nature, also the law of Moses, or the Gospel of Christ; have had the advantage of a religious education; have sat under a Gospel ministry, and received much speculative light and knowledge; yea, have been under convictions of sin time after time, and yet have been ringleaders and encouragers of others in sin, guilty of very enormous crimes, which in themselves are comparable to "scarlet" and "crimson": and perhaps reference may be had to the sin of murder, since the persons, among whom these dwelt, their hands were full of blood; and may respect the crucifiers of Christ, among whom there were some savingly convicted and converted. Moreover, they may be signified hereby on account of the effects of them, they defile men, provoke God to wrath, and, through the law, work wrath in their consciences; and may signify, that they are sins of a deep dye, and which have such a place in their hearts and consciences, that nothing can remove them but the blood of Christ: and besides are open, flagrant, and notorious to all, and especially to God; yet these, through the grace and blood of Jesus, become as white as wool and as snow: not that pardon of sin takes sin out of the hearts and natures of men, nor changes the nature of sin, or causes it to cease to be sin; but this is to be understood of the persons of sinners, who hereby are made so white, yea, whiter than this, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-1.htm">Psalm 51:1</a> as they are considered in Christ, washed in his blood, and clothed with his righteousness, which is fine linen, clean and white; God, seeing no iniquity in them, has thus graciously dealt with them, and they being without fault, spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing. It was with respect to this Scripture that the Jews in later times were wont to tie a scarlet thread to the head of the scapegoat, when he was sent into the wilderness; though at first they fastened it to the door of the outward porch, and then to the door of the inward porch, and, if it turned white, it was a sign their sins were forgiven them, but, if not, otherwise (k); and it is owned by them, that it belongs to future time, the time of the Messiah (l). <p>(k) T. Bab. Sabbat, fol. 89. 2.((l) Gussetius observes, that signifies not "oppressed", but infected with leaven, and so  means, reduce to a right way him that is corrupt with the leaven of vice, by hindering him that he may not go on to hurt the fatherless.

The difficulty would be obviated by the subtle and attractive rendering (proposed, but now withdrawn, by Cheyne) “let us bring our dispute to an end”; but this is unsupported by grammar or usage. The second member of each sentence might be taken as an indignant question, “If your sins are … shall they be white …?”—or as an ironical concession, “Though your sins be … let them be white …!” The idea of pardon, however, may be retained, provided it be understood as conditioned by the alternative of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/1-19.htm" title="If you be willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land:...">Isaiah 1:19-20</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">scarlet</span> and <span class="ital">crimson</span> are really synonyms for one colour, properly “crimson.” The dye in question was obtained from the dried and powdered bodies of an insect (<span class="ital">coccus ilicis</span>, in Hebr. <span class="ital">tôla‘ath shânî</span> = “bright worm”).

It is possible that &#1500;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; is pointed as it is here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-24.htm">Exodus 34:24</a> and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-11.htm">Deuteronomy 31:11</a>, instead of &#1500;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; - like &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-15.htm">Exodus 23:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-20.htm">Exodus 34:20</a>, - for the purpose of avoiding an expression which might be so easily misunderstood as denoting a sight of God with the bodily eye. But the niphal is firmly established in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-17.htm">Exodus 23:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-23.htm">Exodus 34:23</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-22.htm">1 Samuel 1:22</a>; and in the Mishnah and Talmud the terms &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1492; and &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; are applied without hesitation to appearance before God at the principal feasts. They visited the temple diligently enough indeed, but who had required this at their hand, i.e., required them to do this? Jehovah certainly had not. "To tread my courts" is in apposition to this, which it more clearly defines. Jehovah did not want them to appear before His face, i.e., He did not wish for this spiritless and undevotional tramping thither, this mere opus operatum, which might as well have been omitted, since it only wore out the floor. </body></html>
