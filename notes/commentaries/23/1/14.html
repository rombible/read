This awakened them to bring sacrifices and offerings, as if they would bribe God to remove the punishment, and give them leave to go on in their sin. Many who will readily part with their sacrifices, will not be persuaded to part with their sins. They relied on the mere form as a service deserving a reward. The most costly devotions of wicked people, without thorough reformation of heart and life, cannot be acceptable to God. He not only did not accept them, but he abhorred them. All this shows that sin is very hateful to God. If we allow ourselves in secret sin, or forbidden indulgences; if we reject the salvation of Christ, our very prayers will become abomination.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Your appointed feasts - That is, your assemblies convened on regular set times - &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;  mo&#770;&#8219;e&#770;d, from &#1497;&#1506;&#1491;  ya&#770;&#8219;ad, to fix, to appoint. Hengstenberg (Chris. iii. p. 87) has shown that this word (&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;  mo&#770;&#8219;e&#774;d&#305;&#770;ym) is applied in the Scriptures only to the sabbath, passover, pentecost, day of atonement, and feast of tabernacles. Prof. Alexander, in loc. It is applied to those festivals, because they were fixed by law to certain periods of the year. This verse is a very impressive repetition of the former, as if the soul was full of the subject, and disposed to dwell upon it.<p>My soul hateth - I hate. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-5.htm">Psalm 11:5</a>. The nouns &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;  nephesh, soul, and &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;  ru&#770;ach, spirit, are often used to denote the person himself, and are to be construed as "I." Thus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-9.htm">Isaiah 26:9</a> : 'With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early;' that is, 'I myself seek thee; I myself do desire thee.' So the phrase, 'deliver my soul,' - &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;  naphesh&#305;&#770;y - that is, deliver me, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-20.htm">Psalm 22:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-3.htm">Psalm 84:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/86-13.htm">Psalm 86:13-14</a>; that thy soul may bless me, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-19.htm">Genesis 27:19</a>; his soul shall dwell at ease, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-13.htm">Psalm 25:13</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-6.htm">Numbers 11:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-2.htm">Isaiah 55:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-4.htm">Job 16:4</a>. So the word spirit: 'Thy watchfulness hath preserved my spirit' - &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;  ru&#770;ch&#305;&#770;y - <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-12.htm">Job 10:12</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-6.htm">Psalm 31:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-5.htm">1 Kings 21:5</a>. The expression here is emphatic, denoting cordial hatred: odi ex animo.<p>They are a trouble - &#1496;&#1512;&#1495;  t&#803;o&#770;rach. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-12.htm">Deuteronomy 1:12</a>, this word denotes a burden, an oppressive lead that produces weariness in bearing it. It is a strong expression, denoting that their acts of hypocrisy and sin had become so numerous, that they became a heavy, oppressive lead.<p>I am weary to bear them - This is language which is taken from the act of carrying a burden until a man becomes weary and faint. So, in accordance with human conceptions, God represents himself as burdened with their vain oblations, and evil conduct. There could be no more impressive statement of the evil effects of sin, than that even Omnipotence was exhausted as with a heavy, oppressive burden. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. appointed&#8212;the sabbath, passover, pentecost, day of atonement, and feast of tabernacles [Hengstenberg]; they alone were fixed to certain times of the year.<p>weary&#8212;(Isa 43:24).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth,....

The vineyard and cucumber field (mikshah, from kisshu, a cucumber, Cucumis, not a gourd, Cucurbita; at least not the true round gourd, whose Hebrew name, dala&#770;th, does not occur in the Old Testament) are pictured by the prophet in their condition before the harvest (not after, as the Targums render it), when it is necessary that they should be watched. The point of comparison therefore is, that in the vineyard and cucumber field not a human being is to be seen in any direction; and there is nothing but the cottage and the night barrack or hammock (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-18.htm">Job 27:18</a>) to show that there are any human beings there at all. So did Jerusalem stand in the midst of desolation, reaching far and wide - a sign, however, that the land was not entirely depopulated. But what is the meaning of the third point of comparison? Hitzig renders it, "like a watch-tower;" Knobel, "like a guard-city." But the noun neither means a tower nor a castle (although the latter would be quite possible, according to the primary meaning, Cingere); and nezura&#770;h does not mean "watch" or "guard." On the other hand, the comparison indicated (like, or as) does not suit what would seem the most natural rendering, viz., "like a guarded city," i.e., a city shielded from danger. Moreover, it is inadmissible to take the first two Caphs in the sense of sicut (as) and the third in the sense of sic (so); since, although this correlative is common in clauses indicating identity, it is not so in sentences which institute a simple comparison. We therefore adopt the rendering, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>, "As a besieged city," deriving nezura&#770;h not from zur, niphal na&#770;zor (never used), as Luzzatto does, but from na&#770;zar, which signifies to observe with keen eye, either with a good intention, or, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/7-20.htm">Job 7:20</a>, for a hostile purpose. It may therefore be employed, like the synonyms in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-16.htm">2 Samuel 11:16</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:6</a>, to denote the reconnoitring of a city. Jerusalem was not actually blockaded at the time when the prophet uttered his predictions; but it was like a blockaded city. In the case of such a city there is a desolate space, completely cleared of human beings, left between it and the blockading army, in the centre of which the city itself stands solitary and still, shut up to itself. The citizens do not venture out; the enemy does not come within the circle that immediately surrounds the city, for fear of the shots of the citizens; and everything within this circle is destroyed, either by the citizens themselves, to prevent the enemy from finding anything useful, or else by the enemy, who cut down the trees. Thus, with all the joy that might be felt at the preservation of Jerusalem, it presented but a gloomy appearance. It was, as it were, in a state of siege. A proof that this is the way in which the passage is to be explained, may be found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-16.htm">Jeremiah 4:16-17</a>, where the actual storming of Jerusalem is foretold, and the enemy is called nozerim, probably with reference to the simile before us. </body></html>
