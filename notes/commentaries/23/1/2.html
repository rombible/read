The words remind us of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-19.htm" title="I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both you and your seed may live:">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-1.htm" title="Give ear, O you heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.">Deuteronomy 32:1</a>, but the thought was the common inheritance of Hebrew poets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-4.htm" title="He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.">Psalm 50:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-19.htm" title="Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened to my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.">Jeremiah 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-29.htm" title="O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.">Jeremiah 22:29</a>), and we can draw no inference from the parallelism as to the date of either book.<p><span class= "bld">I have nourished and brought up children. </span>The last word has in the Hebrew the emphasis of position: <span class= "ital">Sons I have reared and brought up. </span>From those who had thus grown up under a father’s care filial duty might have been expected; but it was not so. The sons had rebelled against their father’s control. It is significant that the prophet starts from the thought of the fatherhood of God in His relation to Israel. The people might be unworthy of their election, but He had chosen them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm" title="And you shall say to Pharaoh, Thus said the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:">Exodus 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-1.htm" title="You are the children of the LORD your God: you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-1.htm" title="When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.">Hosea 11:1</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm" title="Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD has spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.">Isaiah 1:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">Hear, O heavens, </span>&c. — “God is introduced as entering upon a solemn and public action, or pleading, before the whole world, against his disobedient people.

God's professing people did not know or consider that they owed their lives and comforts to God's fatherly care and kindness. How many are very careless in the affairs of their souls! Not considering what we do know in religion, does us as much harm, as ignorance of what we should know. The wickedness was universal. Here is a comparison taken from a sick and diseased body. The distemper threatens to be mortal. From the sole of the foot even to the head; from the meanest peasant to the greatest peer, there is no soundness, no good principle, no religion, for that is the health of the soul. Nothing but guilt and corruption; the sad effects of Adam's fall. This passage declares the total depravity of human nature. While sin remains unrepented, nothing is done toward healing these wounds, and preventing fatal effects. Jerusalem was exposed and unprotected, like the huts or sheds built up to guard ripening fruits. These are still to be seen in the East, where fruits form a large part of the summer food of the people. But the Lord had a small remnant of pious servants at Jerusalem. It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed. The evil nature is in every one of us; only Jesus and his sanctifying Spirit can restore us to spiritual health.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hear, O heavens - This is properly the beginning of the prophecy. It is a sublime commencement; and is of a highly poetic character. The heavens and the earth are summoned to bear witness to the apostasy, ingratitude, and deep depravity of the chosen people of God. The address is expressive of deep feeling - the bursting forth of a heart filled with amazement at a wonderful and unusual event. The same sublime beginning is found in the song of Moses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-1.htm">Deuteronomy 32:1</a> :<p>Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak;<p>And hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.<p>Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/4-3.htm">Psalm 4:3-4</a>. Thus also the prophets often invoke the hills and mountains to hear them; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-3.htm">Ezekiel 6:3</a> : 'Ye mountains of Israel, hear the words of the Lord God: Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains, and to the hills, and to the rivers, and to the valleys;' compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-1.htm">Ezekiel 36:1</a>. 'Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the Lord,' <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-12.htm">Jeremiah 2:12</a>. By the heavens therefore, in this place, we are not to understand the inhabitants of heaven, that is, the angels, anymore than by the hills we are to understand the inhabitants of the mountains. It is high poetic language, denoting the importance of the subject, and the remarkable and amazing truth to which the attention was to be called.<p>Give ear, O earth - It was common thus to address the earth on any remarkable occasion, especially anyone implying warm expostulation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-19.htm">Jeremiah 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-29.htm">Jeremiah 22:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-2.htm">Micah 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-1.htm">Isaiah 34:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-13.htm">Isaiah 49:13</a>.<p>For - Since it is Yahweh that speaks, all the universe is summoned to attend; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/33-8.htm">Psalm 33:8-9</a> : 'Let all the earth fear the Lord; let all the inhabitants of the World stand in awe of him. For he spake and it was done; he commanded and it stood fast.'<p>The Lord -  - &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; yehova&#770;h, or Jehovah. The small capitals used here and elsewhere throughout the Bible in printing the word Lord, denote that the original word is Yahweh. It is derived from the verb &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;  ha&#770;ya&#770;h, "to be;" and is used to denote "being," or the fountain of being, and can be applied only to the true God; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a> : 'And God said unto Moses, I Am That I Am, &#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;  'eheyeh 'a&#774;sher 'eheyeh; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-21.htm">Numbers 11:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-8.htm">Isaiah 47:8</a>. It is a name which is never given to idols, or conferred on a creature; and though it occurs often in the Hebrew Scriptures, as is indicated by the small capitals, yet our translators have retained it but four times; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-18.htm">Psalm 83:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-2.htm">Isaiah 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-4.htm">Isaiah 26:4</a>. In combination, however, with other names, it occurs often. Thus in Isaiah, meaning the salvation of Yahweh; "Jeremiah," the exaltation or grandeur of Yahweh, etc.; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-14.htm">Genesis 22:14</a> : 'Abraham called the name of the place "Jehovah-jireh,'" <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-15.htm">Exodus 17:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-24.htm">Judges 6:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a>. The Jews never pronounced this name, not even in reading their own Scriptures. So sacred did they deem it, that when it occurred in their books, instead of the word Yahweh, they substituted the word &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;  'a&#774;dona&#772;y, "Lord." Our translators have shown respect to this feeling of the Jews in regard to the sacredness of the name; and hence, have rendered it by the name of Lord - a word which by no means conveys the sense of the word Yahweh. It would have been an advantage to our version if the word Yahweh had been retained wherever it occurs in the original.<p>I have nourished - Hebrew "I have made great;" &#1490;&#1491;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497;  g&#305;&#770;dalet&#305;&#770;y. In Piel, the word means "to make great, to cause to grow;" as e. g., the hair; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>, plants, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-14.htm">Isaiah 44:14</a>; then to educate or bring up children; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-21.htm">Isaiah 49:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-6.htm">2 Kings 10:6</a><p>And brought up - &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;  romameth&#305;&#770;y, from &#1512;&#1493;&#1501;  ru&#770;m, "to lift up" or "exalt." In Piel it means to bring up, nourish, educate; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-4.htm">Isaiah 23:4</a>. These words, though applied often to the training up of children, yet are used here also to denote the elevation to which they had been raised. He had not merely trained them up, but he had trained them up to an elevated station; to special honor and privileges. "Children." Hebrew &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;  ba&#770;nn&#305;&#770;ym - sons." They were the adopted children of God; and they are represented as being weak, and ignorant, and helpless as children, when he took them under his fatherly protection and care; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1</a> : 'When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt;' compare the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-15.htm">Matthew 2:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-8.htm">Isaiah 63:8-16</a>.<p>They have rebelled - This complaint was often brought against the Jews; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6-8</a>. This is the sum of the charge against them. God had shown them special favors. He recounted his mercy in bringing them out of Egypt; and on the ground of this, he demanded obedience and love; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-1.htm">Exodus 20:1-3</a>. And yet they bad forgotten him, and rebelled against him. The Targum of Jonathan, an ancient Chaldee version, has well expressed the idea here. 'Hear, O heavens, which were moved when I gave my law to my people: give ear, O earth, which didst tremble before my word, for the Lord has spoken. My people, the house of Israel, whom I called sons - I loved them - I honored them, and they rebelled against me.' The same is true substantially of all sinners; and alas, how often may a similar expostulation be made with the professed people of God! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

To what the Lord was about to say of his controversy with his people, which was to be managed openly and publicly before them as spectators and witnesses; this designs either strictly and properly the heavens and the earth, or figuratively the inhabitants of them, angels and men. The address is solemn, and denotes something of moment and importance to be done and attended to: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-1.htm">Deuteronomy 32:1</a>. The Targum is, <p>"hear, O ye heavens, that were moved when I gave my law to my people; and hearken, O earth, that trembleth before my word.'' <p>For the Lord hath spoken: not only by Moses, and the prophets that were before Isaiah, but he had spoken to him the words he was now about to deliver; for they were not his own words, but the Lord's: he spoke by the inspiration of God, and as moved by the Holy Ghost; and therefore what he said was to be received, not as the word of man, but as the word of God: <p>I have nourished and brought up children; meaning the Jews; <p>"my people, the house of Israel, whom I have called children,'' <p>as the Targum paraphrases it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a> to these, as a nation, belonged the adoption; they were reckoned the children of God; the Lord took notice and care of them in their infant state, brought them out of Egypt, led them through the wilderness, and fed them in it; brought them into Canaan's land, drove out the nations before them, and settled them there; gave them his laws and ordinances, distinguished them from all other nations by his favours, and raised them to a high estate, to much greatness and prosperity, especially in the days of David and Solomon. The words may be rendered, "I have magnified", or "made great, and have exalted children" (s); not only brought them up, but brought them to great honour and dignity; and even unto man's estate, unto the time appointed of the Father, when they should have been under tutors and governors no longer, but under the King Messiah; but they were rebellious, as follows: <p>and they have rebelled against me, their Lord and King; for the Jews were under a theocracy; God, who was their Father, was their King, and they rebelled against him by breaking his laws, which rebellion is aggravated by its being not only of subjects against their king, but of children against their father; the law concerning a rebellious son, see in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-18.htm">Deuteronomy 21:18</a>. The Targum paraphrases it, "they have rebelled against my Word"; the essential Word, the Messiah; the Septuagint version is, "but they have rejected me" (t); and the Vulgate Latin version (u), "but they have despised me": so the Jews rejected and despised the true Messiah when he came, would not have him to reign over them, would not receive his yoke, though easy, but rebelled against him. The Jews were a rebellious people from the beginning, in Moses's time, and in the prophets, and so quite down to the times of the Messiah. <p>(s) "magnificavi", Montanus, Vatablus; "exaltavi", Munster; "extuli", Jun. &amp; Tremel.

It is possible that the occasion of this revelation may have been some particular incident of the kind last mentioned, such as e.g. the decision of Ahaz to call in the help of Assyria (ch. 7), or Hezekiah’s treaty with Egypt in 701 (cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/30-9.htm" title="That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the LORD:...">Isaiah 30:9-15</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">2, 3</span>.

The groundwork of Isaiah's entire prophecy is Judah's defection from God. God's people have sinned, done amiss, dealt wickedly. The hour of vengeance approaches. Punishment has begun, and will go on, continually increasing in severity. National repentance would avert God's judgments, but the nation will not repeat. God's vengeance will fall, and by it a remnant will be purified, and return to God, and be his true people. In the present section the indictment is laid. Judah's sins are called to her remembrance. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth</span>. "A grave and magnificent exorilium! All nature is invoked to hear Jehovah make complaint of the ingratitude of his people" (Rosenm&uuml;ller). The invocation is cast in the same form with that so common in Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 4:26; 30:19; 31:28; 32:1), and seems to indicate familiarity with that book. The idea extends widely among sacred and other poets (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-1.htm">Micah 6:1, 2</a>; Aesch., 'P.

Notwithstanding their disobedience, God still acknowledges them as his "sons." <span class="cmt_word">They have rebelled against me.</span> The verb used is generally rendered in our version "transgressed" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-13.htm">Jeremiah 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-13.htm">Hosea 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-4.htm">Amos 4:4</a>); but it may also have the stronger sense here assigned it. Lowth translates, "revolted from me;" Gesenius, "fallen away from me;" Cheyne, "broken away from me." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/songs/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>10 I was a wall,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And my breasts like towers;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I became in his eyes<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like one who findeth peace.<p>In the language of prose, the statement would be: Your conduct is good and wise, as my own example shows; of me also ye thus faithfully took care; and that I met this your solicitude with strenuous self-preservation, has become, to my joy and yours, the happiness of my life. That in this connection not &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1495;&#1493;&#1502;&#1492;, but &#1495;&#1493;&#1502;&#1492; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; has to be used, is clear: she compares herself with her sister, and the praise she takes to herself she takes to the honour of her brothers. The comparison of her breasts to towers is suggested by the comparison of her person to a wall; Kleuker rightly remarks that here the comparison is not of thing with thing, but of relation with relation: the breasts were those of her person, as the towers were of the wall, which, by virtue of the power of defence which they conceal within themselves, never permit the enemy, whose attention they attract, to approach them. The two substantival clauses, murus et ubera mea instar turrium, have not naturally a retrospective signification, as they would in a historical connection (vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-10.htm">Genesis 2:10</a>); but they become retrospective by the following "then I became," like <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-5.htm">Deuteronomy 26:5</a>, by the historical tense following, where, however, it is to be remarked that the expression, having in itself no relation to time, which is incapable of being expressed in German, mentions the past not in a way that excludes the present, but as including it. She was a wall, and her breasts like the towers, i.e., all seductions rebounded from her, and ventured not near her awe-inspiring attractions; then (&#1488;&#1494;, temporal, but at the same time consequent; thereupon, and for this reason, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-8.htm">Psalm 40:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-15.htm">Jeremiah 22:15</a>, etc.) she became in his (Solomon's) eyes as one who findeth peace. According to the shepherd-hypothesis, she says here: he deemed it good to forbear any further attempts, and to let me remain in peace (Ewald, Hitz., and others). But how is that possible? &#1502;&#1510;&#1488; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; &#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; is a variation of the frequently occurring &#1502;&#1510;&#1488; &#1495;&#1503; &#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, which is used especially of a woman gaining the affections of a man, <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-17.htm">Esther 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-2.htm">Jeremiah 31:2</a> f.; and the expression here used, "thus I was in his eyes as one who findeth peace" is only the more circumstantial expression for, "then I found (&#1488;&#1494; &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;) in his eyes peace," which doubtless means more than: I brought it to this, that he left me further unmolested; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; in this case, as syn. of &#1495;&#1503;, means inward agreement, confidence, friendship, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-10.htm">Psalm 41:10</a>; there it means, as in the salutation of peace and in a hundred other cases, a positive good. And why should she use &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; instead of &#1495;&#1503;, but that she might form a play upon the name which she immediately, Sol 8:11, thereafter utters, &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;, which signifies, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9</a>, "The man of peace." That Shulamith had found shalom (peace) with Shelomoh (Solomon), cannot be intended to mean that uninjured she escaped from him, but that she had entered into a relation to him which seemed to her a state of blessed peace. The delicate description, "in his eyes," is designed to indicate that she appeared to him in the time of her youthful discipline as one finding peace. The &#1499; is &#1499; veritatis, i.e., the comparison of the fact with its idea, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-2.htm">Isaiah 29:2</a>, or of the individual with the general and common, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-10.htm">Ezekiel 26:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-3.htm">Zechariah 14:3</a>. Here the meaning is, that Shulamith appeared to him corresponding to the idea of one finding peace, and thus as worthy to find peace with him. One "finding peace" is one who gains the heart of a man, so that he enters into a relation of esteem and affection for her. This generalization of the idea also opposes the notion of a history of seduction. &#1502;&#1493;&#1495;&#1488;&#1514; is from the ground-form matsiat, the parallel form to &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-22.htm">2 Samuel 18:22</a>. Solomon has won her, not by persuasion or violence; but because she could be no other man's, he entered with her into the marriage covenant of peace (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-17.htm">Proverbs 2:17</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-10.htm">Isaiah 54:10</a>). </body></html>
