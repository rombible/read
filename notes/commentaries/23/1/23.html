The <span class= "ital">kadi </span>himself is in secret partnership with the brigands who infest the highways. Nothing can be done without <span class= "ital">baksheesh, </span>and the robbers who have the plunder can bribe more heavily than the man whom they have robbed.

To the complaints of the widow and the orphan the judges turned a deaf ear, and put off the hearing of their cause with indefinite procrastination. There is, perhaps, a touch of irony in the word for “bribes” (<span class= "ital">shalmōnîm, </span>as if “peace gifts”), which were sought after, instead of <span class= "ital">shalôm, </span>the true peace itself.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:21-31 Neither holy cities nor royal ones are faithful to their trust, if religion does not dwell in them. Dross may shine like silver, and the wine that is mixed with water may still have the colour of wine. Those have a great deal to answer for, who do not help the oppressed, but oppress them. Men may do much by outward restraints; but only God works effectually by the influences of his Spirit, as a Spirit of Judgment. Sin is the worst captivity, the worst slavery. The redemption of the spiritual Zion, by the righteousness and death of Christ, and by his powerful grace, most fully accord with what is here meant. Utter ruin is threatened. The Jews should become as a tree when blasted by heat; as a garden without water, which in those hot countries would soon be burned up. Thus shall they be that trust in idols, or in an arm of flesh. Even the strong man shall be as tow; not only soon broken, and pulled to pieces, but easily catching fire. When the sinner has made himself as tow and stubble, and God makes himself as a consuming fire, what can prevent the utter ruin of the sinner?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy princes ... - This is an explanation of the previous verse.

The first admonition lays the foundation for the rest. They were to learn to do good - a difficult art, in which a man does not become proficient merely by good intentions. "Learn to do good:" hetib is the object to limdu (learn), regarded as an accusative; the inf. abs. &#1492;&#1512;&#1506; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16</a> takes the place of the object in just the same manner. The division of this primary admonition into four minor ones relating to the administration of justice, may be explained from the circumstance that no other prophet directs so keen an eye upon the state and its judicial proceedings as Isaiah has done. He differs in this respect from his younger contemporary Micah, whose prophecies are generally more ethical in their nature, whilst those of Isaiah have a political character throughout. Hence the admonitions: "Give diligent attention to judgment" (da&#770;rash, to devote one's self to a thing with zeal and assiduity); and "bring the oppressor to the right way." This is the true rendering, as Cha&#770;motz (from Cha&#770;matz, to be sharp in flavour, glaring in appearance, violent and impetuous in character) cannot well mean "the oppressed," or the man who is deprived of his rights, as most of the early translators have rendered it, since this form of the noun, especially with an immutable kametz like &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1493;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492; (cf., &#1504;&#1511;&#1491; &#1504;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;), is not used in a passive, but in an active or attributive sense (Ewald, 152, b: vid., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-8.htm">Psalm 137:8</a>): it has therefore the same meaning as Chomeotz in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/71-4.htm">Psalm 71:4</a>, and a&#770;shok in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>, which is similar in its form. But if Cha&#770;motz signifies the oppressive, reckless, churlish man, &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512; cannot mean to make happy, or to congratulate, or to set up, or, as in the talmudic rendering, to strengthen (Luzzatto: rianimate chi  oppresso); but, as it is also to be rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-12.htm">Isaiah 3:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-15.htm">Isaiah 9:15</a>, to lead to the straight road, or to cause a person to keep the straight course. In the case before us, where the oppressor is spoken of, it means to direct him to the way of justice, to keep him in bounds by severe punishment and discipline.<p>(Note: The Talmud varies in its explanation of Chamoz: in one instance it is applied to a judge who lets his sentence be thoroughly leavened before pronouncing it; in another the Chamuz is said to signify a person robbed and injured, in opposition to Chomez (b. Sanhedrin 35a). It is an instructive fact in relation to the idea suggested by the word, that, according to Joma 39b, a man who had not only taken possession of his own inheritance, but had seized upon another person's also, bore the nickname of ben chimzon as long as he lived.)<p>In the same way we find in other passages, such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/72-4.htm">Psalm 72:4</a>, severe conduct towards oppressors mentioned in connection with just treatment of the poor. There follow two admonitions relating to widows and orphans. Widows and orphans, as well as foreigners, were the protgs of God and His law, standing under His especial guardianship and care (see, for example, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22</a> (21), cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-21.htm">Exodus 21:21</a> (20). "Do justice to the orphan" (Sha&#770;phat, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-1.htm">Deuteronomy 25:1</a>, is a contracted expression for sha&#770;phat mishpat): for if there is not even a settlement or verdict in their cause, this is the most crying injustice of all, as neither the form nor the appearance of justice is preserved. "Conduct the cause of the widows:" &#1512;&#1497;&#1489; with an accusative, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-22.htm">Isaiah 51:22</a>, the only other passage in which it occurs, is a contracted form for &#1512;&#1497;&#1489; &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;. Thus all the grounds of self-defence, which existed in the hearts of the accused, are both negatively and positively overthrown. They are thundered down and put to shame. The law (thorah), announced in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>, has been preached to them. The prophet has cast away the husks of their dead works, and brought out the moral kernel of the law in its universal application. </body></html>
