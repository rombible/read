(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/18-11.htm" title="The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank you, that I am not as other men are, extortionists, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.">Luke 18:11-13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">When ye make many prayers.</span>—The Pentateuch contains no directions for the use of forms of prayer beyond the benediction of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/6-23.htm" title="Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, On this wise you shall bless the children of Israel, saying to them,">Numbers 6:23-26</a>, and two forms connected with the Passover in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/26-5.htm" title="And you shall speak and say before the LORD your God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous:">Deuteronomy 26:5-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/26-13.htm" title="Then you shall say before the LORD your God, I have brought away the hallowed things out of my house, and also have given them to the Levite, and to the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all your commandments which you have commanded me: I have not transgressed your commandments, neither have I forgotten them.">Deuteronomy 26:13-15</a>. The “eighteen prayers” for daily use belong to the later Rabbinic stage of Judaism. It lies in the nature of the case, however, that first a real, and then an ostentatious devotion would show itself in the use of such forms, possibly, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-164.htm" title="Seven times a day do I praise you because of your righteous judgments.">Psalm 119:164</a>, “seven times a day.” In <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-14.htm" title="He that blesses his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.">Proverbs 27:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-9.htm" title="He that turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.">Proverbs 28:9</a>, which belong to the reign of Hezekiah, and may, therefore, indirectly represent Isaiah’s teaching, we have the warnings of the wise as to the right use of such forms.<p><span class= "bld">Your hands are full of blood.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">bloods, </span>as implying many murderous acts. The words point to the guilt of judges and princes, such as that described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-2.htm" title="By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood touches blood.">Hosea 4:2</a>. Life was sacrificed to greed of gain, or lust, or vindictiveness. To the prophet’s eye those hands, stretched upwards in the Temple by some, at least, of the king’s ministers and judges, were red with the blood of the slain. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-3.htm" title="For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue has muttered perverseness.">Isaiah 59:3</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-15.htm" title="And when you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you: yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.">Isaiah 1:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">When ye spread forth your hands — </span>When ye pray with your hands spread abroad, as the manner was; <span class="ital">I will hide mine eyes from you </span>— I will take no notice of your persons or requests. <span class="ital">Your hands are full of blood </span>— You are guilty of murder and oppression, and of other crying sins, which I abhor, and have forbidden under pain of my highest displeasure.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:10-15 Judea was desolate, and their cities burned. This awakened them to bring sacrifices and offerings, as if they would bribe God to remove the punishment, and give them leave to go on in their sin. Many who will readily part with their sacrifices, will not be persuaded to part with their sins. They relied on the mere form as a service deserving a reward. The most costly devotions of wicked people, without thorough reformation of heart and life, cannot be acceptable to God. He not only did not accept them, but he abhorred them. All this shows that sin is very hateful to God. If we allow ourselves in secret sin, or forbidden indulgences; if we reject the salvation of Christ, our very prayers will become abomination.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye spread forth your hands - This is an expression denoting the act of supplication. When we ask for help, we naturally stretch out our hands, as if to receive it. The expression therefore is equivalent to 'when ye pray, or implore mercy.' Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-29.htm">Exodus 9:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-11.htm">Exodus 17:11-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-22.htm">1 Kings 8:22</a>.<p>I will hide mine eyes ... - That is, I will not attend to, or regard your supplications. The Chaldee Paraphrase is, 'When your priests expand their hands to pray for you.'<p>Your hands ... - This is given as a reason why he would not hear. The expression full of blood, denotes crime and guilt of a high order - as, in murder, the hands would be dripping in blood, and as the stain on the hands would be proof of guilt. It is probably a figurative expression, not meaning literally that they were murderers, but that they were given to rapine and injustice; to the oppression of the poor, the widow, etc. The sentiment is, that because they indulged in sin, and came, even in their prayers, with a determination still to indulge it, God would not hear them. The same sentiment is elsewhere expressed; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-18.htm">Psalm 66:18</a> : 'If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me;' <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-9.htm">Proverbs 28:9</a> : 'He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination;' <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-10.htm">Jeremiah 16:10-12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-11.htm">Zechariah 7:11-12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28-29</a>. This is the reason why the prayers of sinners are not heard - But the truth is abundantly taught in the Scriptures, that if sinners will forsake their sins, the greatness of their iniquity is no obstacle to forgiveness; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-11.htm">Luke 16:11-24</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

But cruelty and oppression, producing poverty and wretchedness, and tending to shorten life, are no doubt also included (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-10.htm">Micah 3:10, 11</a>). These were the special sins of the time (see vers. 17, 23). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>For the present, however, Jerusalem was saved from this extremity. The omnipotence of God had mercifully preserved it: "Unless Jehovah of hosts had left us a little of what had escaped, we had become like Sodom, we were like Gomorrah." Sarid (which is rendered inaccurately &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; in the Sept.; cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-29.htm">Romans 9:29</a>) was used, even in the early Mosaic usage of the language, to signify that which escaped the general destruction (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-34.htm">Deuteronomy 2:34</a>, etc.); and &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1496; (which might very well be connected with the verbs which follow: "we were very nearly within a little like Sodom," etc.) is to be taken in connection with sarid, as the pausal form clearly shows: "a remnant which was but a mere trifle" (on this use of the word, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-14.htm">Isaiah 16:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-7.htm">2 Chronicles 12:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-20.htm">Proverbs 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-12.htm">Psalm 105:12</a>). Jehovah Zebaoth stands first, for the sake of emphasis. It would have been all over with Israel long ago, if it had not been for the compassion of God (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-8.htm">Hosea 11:8</a>). And because it was the omnipotence of God, which set the will of His compassion in motion, He is called Jehovah Zebaoth, Jehovah (the God) of the heavenly hosts - an expression in which Zebaoth is a dependent genitive, and not, as Luzzatto supposes, an independent name of God as the Absolute, embracing within itself all the powers of nature. The prophet says "us" and "we." He himself was an inhabitant of Jerusalem; and even if he had not been so, he was nevertheless an Israelite. He therefore associates himself with his people, like Jeremiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22</a>. He had had to experience the anger of God along with the rest; and so, on the other hand, he also celebrates the mighty compassion of God, which he had experienced in common with them. But for this compassion, the people of God would have become like Sodom, from which only four human beings escaped: it would have resembled Gomorrah, which was absolutely annihilated.
