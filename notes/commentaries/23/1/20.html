We must be doing, not stand idle. We must be doing the good the Lord our God requires. It is plain that the sacrifices of the law could not atone, even for outward national crimes. But, blessed be God, there is a Fountain opened, in which sinners of every age and rank may be cleansed. Though our sins have been as scarlet and crimson, a deep dye, a double dye, first in the wool of original corruption, and afterwards in the many threads of actual transgression; though we have often dipped into sin, by many backslidings; yet pardoning mercy will take out the stain, Ps 51:7. They should have all the happiness and comfort they could desire. Life and death, good and evil, are set before us. O Lord, incline all of us to live to thy glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But if ye refuse, ye shall be devoured with the sword - Your enemies shall come in, and lay waste the land. This prediction was fulfilled, in consequence of their continuing to rebel, when the land was desolated by Nebuchadnezzar, and the nation was carried captive to Babylon. It illustrates a general principle of the divine government, that if people persevere in rebelling against God, they shall be destroyed. The word devour is applied to the sword, as if it were insatiable for destruction. Whatever destroys may be figuratively said to devour; see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5-6</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-3.htm">Lamentations 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-4.htm">Ezekiel 15:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-3.htm">Joel 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-5.htm">Revelation 11:5</a> - where fire is said to devour.<p>The mouth of the Lord - Yahweh Himself.

They are the great principles of the divine administration, that if people obey God they shall prosper; if not, they shall be punished. They commend themselves to people as just and true; and they are seen and illustrated every where. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20.

The elegy (<span class="ital">qînâh</span>, distinguished by a peculiar rhythm and by the opening word <span class="ital">’êkâh</span>, “how”) is a frequent vehicle of prophetic utterance. This is the clearest instance in the genuine writings of Isaiah, and it is characteristic of the ‘city prophet’ (Cheyne), that the subject is not the nation but the idealised capital. Isaiah is in a good sense ‘laudator temporis acti.’ He laments the degeneracy of Jerusalem, looking back probably to the days of David, when it was the abode of judgment and righteousness.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If ye refuse and rebel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "if ye neither consent in will, nor obey in act, "antithetical to the two verbs in the first clause of ver. 19. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall be devoured</span>; or, <span class="accented">ye</span> <span class="accented">shall be eaten</span>.

As the soul (nephesh) of a man, regarded as the band which unites together bodily and spiritual life, though it is not the actual principle of self-consciousness, is yet the place in which he draws, as it were, the circle of self-consciousness, so as to comprehend the whole essence of His being in the single thought of "I;" so, according to a description taken from godlike man, the "soul" (nephesh) of God, as the expression "my soul" indicates, is the centre of His being, regarded as encircled and pervaded (personated) by self-consciousness; and therefore, whatever the soul of God hates (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-1.htm">Jeremiah 15:1</a>) or loves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>), is hated or loved in the inmost depths and to the utmost bounds of His being (Psychol. p. 218). Thus He hated each and all of the festivals that were kept in Jerusalem, whether the beginnings of the month, or the high feast-days (moadim, in which, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23.htm">Leviticus 23</a>, the Sabbath was also included) observed in the course of the month. For a long time past they had become a burden and annoyance to Him: His long-suffering was weary of such worship.
