We must be doing, not stand idle. We must be doing the good the Lord our God requires. It is plain that the sacrifices of the law could not atone, even for outward national crimes. But, blessed be God, there is a Fountain opened, in which sinners of every age and rank may be cleansed. Though our sins have been as scarlet and crimson, a deep dye, a double dye, first in the wool of original corruption, and afterwards in the many threads of actual transgression; though we have often dipped into sin, by many backslidings; yet pardoning mercy will take out the stain, Ps 51:7. They should have all the happiness and comfort they could desire. Life and death, good and evil, are set before us.

To do well stands opposed to all kinds of evil. "Seek judgment." The word "judgment" - &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;  mishpa&#770;t&#803; - here means justice. The direction refers particularly to magistrates, and it is evident that the prophet had them particularly in his view in all this discourse. Execute justice between man and man with impartiality. The word "seek" - &#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;  d&#305;&#770;reshu&#770; - means to pursue, to search for, as an object to be gained; to regard, or care for it, as the main thing. Instead of seeking gain, and bribes, and public favor, they were to make it an object of intense interest to do justice.<p>Relieve -  - &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;  'asheru&#770; - literally, make straight, Or right (margin, righten). The root - &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;  'a&#770;shar - means to proceed, to walk forward in a direct line; and bears a relation to &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;  ya&#770;shar, to be straight. Hence, it often means to be successful or prosperous - to go straight forward to success. In Piel, which is the form used here, it means to cause to go straight; and hence, applied to leaders, judges, and guides, to conduct those under their care in a straight path, and not in the devices and crooked Ways of sin; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-19.htm">Proverbs 23:19</a> :<p>Hear thou, my son, and he wise,<p>And guide &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;  'asher, "make straight") thine heart in the way.<p>The oppressed - Him to whom injustice has been done in regard to his character, person, or property; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6</a>.<p>Judge the fatherless - Do justice to him - vindicate his cause. Take not advantage of his weak and helpless, condition - his ignorance and want of experience. This charge was particularly necessary on account of the facilities which the guardians of orphans have to defraud or oppress, without danger of detection or punishment. Orphans have no experience. Parents are their natural protectors; and therefore God especially charged on their guardians to befriend and do justice to them; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-17.htm">Deuteronomy 24:17</a> : 'Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor the fatherless, nor take the widow's raiment to pledge.'<p>Plead for - Contend for her rights. Aid her by vindicating her cause. She is unable to defend herself; she is liable to oppression; and her rights may be taken away by the crafty and designing. It is remarkable that God so often insists on this in the Scriptures, and makes it no small part of religion; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-17.htm">Deuteronomy 24:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22</a> : 'Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.'

Thus, impiety was said to consist in oppressing the fatherless and widow.<p>They drive away the donkey of the fatherless,<p>They take the widow's ox for a pledge.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. seek judgment&#8212;justice, as magistrates, instead of seeking bribes (Jer 22:3, 16).<p>judge&#8212;vindicate (Ps 68:5; Jas 1:27).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Learn to do well; </span> begin and inure yourselves to live soberly, righteously, and godly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Seek judgment; </span> show your religion to God, by studying and practising justice to men, and neither give nor procure any unrighteous judgment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Relieve the oppressed; </span> be not only just, but merciful. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Judge the fatherless; </span> defend and deliver them, as this word is used, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-8.htm" title="The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to my integrity that is in me.">Psalm 7:8</a>,11 9:4</span>, and oft elsewhere. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Plead for the widow; </span> maintain the righteous cause of poor and helpless persons, against their unjust and potent adversaries; whereby you will show your love to justice and mercy, and that you fear God more than men. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Learn to do well,....

To defend such is specially the duty of the judge, but it is also an obligation lying on every one who has influence in the community. The prophet addresses his hearers (“rulers” and “people” <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-10.htm" title="Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah.">Isaiah 1:10</a></span>) as members of the state; and his demand is that by “seeking judgment” they shall exercise the fundamental virtue of citizenship. The righteousness which he requires is social righteousness, <span class="ital">iustitia civilis</span>, a public life so ordered as to secure for each individual his personal rights. The prophets’ passion for justice is always inspired by a deep sense of the value of the human personality in the sight of God.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Learn to do well.</span> Now comes the positive; first, in the general form" learn," etc.; which resembles the apostle's "Put on the armor of light" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a>).

The fact that it is divided at this point into two separate sections, is indicated in the text by the space left between <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>. This mode of marking larger or smaller sections, either by leaving spaces of by breaking off the line, is older than the vowel points and accents, and rests upon a tradition of the highest antiquity (Hupfeld, Gram. p. 86ff.). The space is called pizka; the section indicated by such a space, a closed parashah (sethumah); and the section indicated by breaking off the line, an open parashah (petuchah). The prophet stops as soon as he has affirmed, that nothing but the mercy of God has warded off from Israel the utter destruction which it so well deserved. He catches in spirit the remonstrances of his hearers. They would probably declare that the accusations which the prophet had brought against them were utterly groundless, and appeal to their scrupulous observance of the law of God. In reply to this self-vindication which he reads in the hearts of the accused, the prophet launches forth the accusations of God. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>, he commences thus: "Hear the word of Jehovah, ye Sodom judges; give ear to the law of our God, O Gomorrah nation! What is the multitude of your slain-offerings to me? saith Jehovah. I am satiated with whole offerings of rams, and the fat of stalled calves; and blood of bullocks and sheep and he-goats I do not like." The second start in the prophet's address commences, like the first, with "hear" and "give ear." The summons to hear is addressed in this instances (as in the case of Isaiah's contemporary Micah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/3-1.htm">Micah 3:1-12</a>) to the kezinim (from ka&#770;za&#770;h, decidere, from which comes the Arabic el-Kadi, the judge, with the substantive termination in: see Jeshurun, p. 212 ss.), i.e., to the men of decisive authority, the rulers in the broadest sense, and to the people subject to them. It was through the mercy of God that Jerusalem was in existence still, for Jerusalem was "spiritually Sodom," as the Revelation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-8.htm">Revelation 11:8</a>) distinctly affirms of Jerusalem, with evident allusion to this passage of Isaiah. Pride, lust of the flesh, and unmerciful conduct, were the leading sins of Sodom, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-49.htm">Ezekiel 16:49</a>; and of these, the rulers of Jerusalem, and the crowd that was subject to them and worthy of them, were equally guilty now. But they fancied that they could not possibly stand in such evil repute with God, inasmuch as they rendered outward satisfaction to the law. The prophet therefore called upon them to hear the law of the God of Israel, which he would announce to them: for the prophet was the appointed interpreter of the law, and prophecy the spirit of the law, and the prophetic institution the constant living presence of the true essence of the law bearing its own witness in Israel. "To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith Jehovah." The prophet intentionally uses the word &#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, not &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;: this was the incessant appeal of God in relation to the spiritless, formal worship offered by the hypocritical, ceremonial righteousness of Israel (the future denoting continuous actions, which is ever at the same time both present and future). The multitude of zeba&#770;chim, i.e., animal sacrifices, had no worth at all to Him. As the whole worship is summed up here in one single act, zeba&#770;chim appears to denote the shelamim, peace-offerings (or better still, communion offerings), with which a meal was associated, after the style of a sacrificial festival, and Jehovah gave the worshipper a share in the sacrifice offered. It is better, however, to take zeba&#770;chim as the general name for all the bleeding sacrifices, which are then subdivided into 'oloth and Cheleb, as consisting partly of whole offerings, or offerings the whole of which was placed upon the altar, though in separate pieces, and entirely consumed, and partly of those sacrifices in which only the fat was consumed upon the altar, namely the sin-offerings, trespass-offerings, and pre-eminently the shela&#770;mim offerings. Of the sacrificial animals mentioned, the bullocks (pa&#770;rim) and fed beasts (meri'im, fattened calves) are species of oxen (bakar); and the lambs (Cebashim) and he-goats (atturim, young he-goats, as distinguished from se'ir, the old long-haired he-goat, the animal used as a sin-offering), together with the ram (ayil, the customary whole offering of the high priest, of the tribe prince, and of the nation generally on all the high feast days), were species of the flock. The blood of these sacrificial animals - such, for example, as the young oxen, sheep, and he-goats - was thrown all round the altar in the case of the whole offering, the peace-offering, and the trespass-offering; in that of the sin-offering it was smeared upon the horns of the altar, poured out at the foot of the altar, and in some instances sprinkled upon the walls of the altar, or against the vessels of the inner sanctuary. Of such offerings as these Jehovah was weary, and He wanted no more (the two perfects denote that which long has been and still is: Ges. 126, 3); in fact, He never had desired anything of the kind. </body></html>
