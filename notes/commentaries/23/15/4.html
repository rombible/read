It is first mentioned as in the power of Sihon king of the Amorites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-26.htm" title="For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to Arnon.">Numbers 21:26</a>).

It had probably fallen into the hands of the Moabites, to whom it had originally belonged (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-26.htm" title="For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to Arnon.">Numbers 21:26</a>). Its ruins exhibit architecture of various periods, Jewish, Roman, and Saracenic; (2) Elealeh, obviously near Heshbon, had shared its fate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-3.htm" title="Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,">Numbers 32:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-37.htm" title="And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,">Numbers 32:37</a>). The ancient name still attaches to its ruins in the form <span class= "ital">El-A’al; </span>(3) Jahaz was the scene of the battle between Sihon and the Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-23.htm" title="And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.">Numbers 21:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-32.htm" title="Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.">Deuteronomy 2:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-20.htm" title="But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.">Judges 11:20</a>), and was also within the region assigned to Reuben (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-10.htm" title="And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, to the border of the children of Ammon;">Joshua 13:10</a>) north of the Arnon. The language of Isaiah implies that it was at some distance from the other two cities. Their cry was to be heard even there. In the Moabite inscription it appears as annexed to Dibon (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>xi. 167). Eusebius (<span class= "ital">Onomast.</span>) names it as between Medeba and <span class= "ital">Debus, </span>the latter name being probably identical with Dibon. The panic is intensified by the fact that even the “armed soldiers” of Moab are powerless to help, and can only join in the ineffectual wailing.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-4.htm" title="And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard even to Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his life shall be grievous to him.">Isaiah 15:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh — </span>Two other Moabitish cities; of which see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/21-25.htm" title="And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelled in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof....">Numbers 21:25-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-3.htm" title="Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,">Numbers 32:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-37.htm" title="And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,">Numbers 32:37</a>. <span class="ital">Their voice shall be heard unto Jahaz </span>— Another city in the utmost borders of Moab. <span class="ital">The armed soldiers shall cry out — </span>Even the warriors themselves, who should defend the state, shall lose all their spirit and courage, and join in the general lamentation and dismay: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-34.htm" title="From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh, and even to Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even to Horonaim, as an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.">Jeremiah 48:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-41.htm" title="Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.">Jeremiah 48:41</a>. <span class="ital">His life shall be grievous unto him </span>— The Moabites shall generally long for death, to free them from those dreadful calamities which they perceive unavoidably coming upon them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-9 The Divine judgments about to come upon the Moabites.   - This prophecy coming to pass within three years, would confirm the prophet's mission, and the belief in all his other prophecies. Concerning Moab it is foretold, 1. That their chief cities should be surprised by the enemy. Great changes, and very dismal ones, may be made in a very little time. 2. The Moabites would have recourse to their idols for relief. Ungodly men, when in trouble, have no comforter. But they are seldom brought by their terrors to approach our forgiving God with true sorrow and believing prayer. 3. There should be the cries of grief through the land. It is poor relief to have many fellow-sufferers, fellow-mourners. 4. The courage of their soldiers should fail. God can easily deprive a nation of that on which it most depended for strength and defence. 5. These calamities should cause grief in the neighbouring parts. Though enemies to Israel, yet as our fellow-creatures, it should be grievous to see them in such distress. In ver. 6-9, the prophet describes the woful lamentations heard through the country of Moab, when it became a prey to the Assyrian army. The country should be plundered. And famine is usually the sad effect of war. Those who are eager to get abundance of this world, and to lay up what they have gotten, little consider how soon it may be all taken from them. While we warn our enemies to escape from ruin, let us pray for them, that they may seek and find forgiveness of their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And Heshbon shall cry - This was a celebrated city of the Amorites, twenty miles east of the Jordan <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a>. It was formerly conquered from the Moabiltes by Sihon, and became his capital, and was taken by the Israelites a little before the death of Moses <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-25.htm">Numbers 21:25</a>. After the carrying away of the ten tribes it was recovered by the Moabites. Jeremiah Jer 48:2 calls it 'the pride of Moab.' The town still subsists under the same name, and is described by Burckhardt. He says, it is situated on a hill, southwest from El Aal (Elealeh). 'Here are the ruins of an ancient town, together with the remains of some edifices built with small stones; a few broken shafts of columns are still standing, a number of deep wells cut in the rock, and a large reservoir of water for the summer supply the inhabitants.' ("Travels in Syria," p. 365.)<p>And Elealeh - This was a town of Reuben about a mile from Heshbon <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-37.htm">Numbers 32:37</a>. Burckhardt visited this place. Its present name is El Aal. 'It stands on the summit of a hill, and takes its name from its situation - Aal, meaning "the high." It commands the whole plain, and the view from the top of the hill is very extensive, comprehending the whole of the southern Belka. El Aal was surrounded by a well built wall, of which some parts yet remain. Among the ruins are a number of large cisterns, fragments of walls, and the foundations of houses, but nothing worthy of notice. The plain around it is alternately chalk and flint.' ("Travels in Syria," p. 365.)<p>Even unto Jahaz - This was a city east of Jordan, near to which Moses defeated Sihon. It was given to Reuben <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-32.htm">Deuteronomy 2:32</a>, and was situated a short distance north of Ar, the capital of Moab.<p>The armed soldiers of Moab - The consternation shall reach the very army. They shall lose their courage, and instead of defending the nation, they shall join in the general weeping and lamentation.<p>His life shall be grievous - As we say of a person who is overwhelmed with calamities, that his life is wearisome, so, says the prophet, shall it be with the whole nation of Moab. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

Two other cities in the land of Moab. The first of these was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who took it from the Moabites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-25.htm">Numbers 21:25</a> it came into the hands of the Reubenites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-3.htm">Numbers 32:3</a> and afterwards was again possessed by the Moabites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-2.htm">Jeremiah 48:2</a>. Josephus (t) calls it Essebon, and mentions it among the cities of Moab; it goes by the name of Esbuta in Ptolemy (u); and is called Esbus by Jerom (w), who says it was a famous city of Arabia in his time, in the mountains over against Jericho, twenty miles distant from Jordan; hence we read of the Arabian Esbonites in Pliny (x). Elealeh was another city of Moab, very near to Heshbon and frequently mentioned with it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9</a>. Jerom says (y) that in his time it was a large village, a mile from Esbus, or Heshbon. By these two places are meant the inhabitants of them, as the Targum paraphrases it, who cried for and lamented the desolation that was coming, or was come upon them: <p>their voice shall be heard even unto Jahaz; sometimes called Jahazah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-18.htm">Joshua 13:18</a> it was a frontier town, at the utmost borders of the land, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-23.htm">Numbers 21:23</a> hence the cry of the inhabitants of the above cities is said to reach to it, which expresses the utter destruction that should be made; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-34.htm">Jeremiah 48:34</a> this is thought to be the same place Ptolemy (z) calls Ziza. Jerom (a) calls it Jazza, as it is in the Septuagint here, and says that in his time it was shown between Medaba and Deblathai. <p>Therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; not as when they go to battle, with courage and cheerfulness, as some have thought; but through fear, and as in great terror and distress; and so it signifies, that not only the weak and unarmed inhabitants, men and women, should be in the utmost confusion and consternation, but the soldiers that should fight for them, and defend them; who were accoutred, or "harnessed", as the word signifies, and were "girt" and prepared for war, as the Targum renders it; even these would be dispirited, and have no heart to fight, but lament their sad case: <p>his life shall be grievous to everyone; the life of every Moabite would be a burden to him; he would choose death rather than life; so great the calamity: or the life of every soldier; or "his soul shall cry out", grieve or mourn for "himself" (b); for his own unhappy case; he shall only be concerned for himself, how to save himself, or make his escape; having none for others, for whose defence he was set, and for whom he was to fight; but would have no concern for his king or country, only for himself. <p>(t) Antiqu. l. 13. c. 15. sect. 4.

Heshbon, now <span class="accented">Hesban</span>, lay about twenty miles east of the Jordan, nearly on the parallel of its embouchure into the Dead Sea. It was the capital city of Sihon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21</a>), who took it from the Moabites. On the partition of Palestine among the tribes of Israel, it was assigned to Reuben (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-37.htm">Numbers 32:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a>); but at a later time we find it reckoned to Gad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-81.htm">1 Chronicles 6:81</a>). We do not know at what time Moab recovered Heshbon, but may conjecture that it was one of the conquests of Mesha, though it is not mentioned on the Moabite Stone. <span class="cmt_word">And Elealeh</span>. Elealch is commonly united with Heshbon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-3.htm">Numbers 32:3, 37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-34.htm">Jeremiah 48:34</a>). It is probably identical with the modern <span class="accented">El-A'al</span>, a ruined town on the top of a rounded hill, little more than a mile north of <span class="accented">Hesban</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Even unto Jahaz</span>. Jahaz lay considerably to the south of Hesh-ben, probably not very far north of the Arnon. It must have been in the vicinity of Dibon, since Mesha, on taking it from the Israelites, annexed it to the territory of that city (Moabite Stone, II. 19-21). It was the scene of the great battle between Sihon and the Israelites under Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-23.htm">Numbers 21:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His life shall be grievous unto him</span>; rather, <span class="accented">his soul shall be grieved within him</span>.

"And the poorest of the poor will feed, and needy ones lie down in peace; and I kill thy root through hunger, and he slays thy remnant." "The poorest of the poor:" beco&#772;re&#772; dallim is an intensified expression for bene&#772; dallim, the latter signifying such as belong to the family of the poor, the former (cf., <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-13.htm">Job 18:13</a>, mors dirissima) such as hold the foremost rank in such a family - a description of Israel, which, although at present deeply, very deeply, repressed and threatened on every side, would then enjoy its land in quietness and peace (<a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-12.htm">Zephaniah 3:12-13</a>). In this sense &#1493;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; is used absolutely; and there is no necessity for Hupfeld's conjecture (Ps. ii. 258), that we should read &#1489;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497; (in my pastures). Israel rises again, but Philistia perishes even to a root and remnant; and the latter again falls a victim on the one hand to the judgment of God (famine), and on the other to the punishment inflicted by the house of David.
