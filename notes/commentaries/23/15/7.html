Concerning Moab it is foretold, 1. That their chief cities should be surprised by the enemy. Great changes, and very dismal ones, may be made in a very little time. 2. The Moabites would have recourse to their idols for relief. Ungodly men, when in trouble, have no comforter. But they are seldom brought by their terrors to approach our forgiving God with true sorrow and believing prayer. 3. There should be the cries of grief through the land. It is poor relief to have many fellow-sufferers, fellow-mourners. 4. The courage of their soldiers should fail. God can easily deprive a nation of that on which it most depended for strength and defence. 5. These calamities should cause grief in the neighbouring parts. Though enemies to Israel, yet as our fellow-creatures, it should be grievous to see them in such distress. In ver. 6-9, the prophet describes the woful lamentations heard through the country of Moab, when it became a prey to the Assyrian army. The country should be plundered. And famine is usually the sad effect of war. Those who are eager to get abundance of this world, and to lay up what they have gotten, little consider how soon it may be all taken from them. While we warn our enemies to escape from ruin, let us pray for them, that they may seek and find forgiveness of their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore, the abundance they have gotten - Their wealth they shall remove from a place that is utterly burned up with drought, where the waters and the grass fail, to another place where they may find water.<p>To the brook of willows - Margin, 'The valley of the Arabians.' The Septuagint renders it, 'I will lead them to the valley of the Arabians, and they shall take it.' So Saadias. It might, perhaps, be called the valley of the Arabians, because it was the boundary line between them and Arabia on the south. Lowth renders it, 'To Babylon.' The probability is, that the prophet refers to some valley or brook that was called the brook of the willows, from the fact that many willows grew upon its bank. Perhaps it was the small stream which flows into the southern extremity of the Dead Sea, and which forms the boundary of Arabia Petrea of the province of Jebal. They withdrew toward the south, where toward Petra or Sela they had their property in herds <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-1.htm">Isaiah 16:1</a>, for probably the invader came from the north, and drove them in this direction. Lowth, and most commentators, suppose that 'they' in this verse refers to the enemies of Moab, and that it means that they would carry away the property of Moab to some distant place. But the more probable meaning is, that when the waters of the Nimrim should fail, they would remove to a place better watered; that is, they would leave their former abode, and wander away. It is an image of the desolation that was coming upon the land. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

The fugitives have now reached the border of their own land, and prepare to cross into Edom. The boundary between the two countries was formed by the Wadi el-Ahsa (“valley of water-pits,” the scene of the miracle in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-16.htm" title="And he said, Thus said the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.">2 Kings 3:16</a> ff. See Robertson Smith, <span class="ital">Old Test. in Jewish Ch</span>. p. 147). In all probability this Wadi is identical with <span class="ital">the brook of the willows</span> here mentioned. There is, however, some doubt about the correct translation of the name, arising from its similarity to the “brook of the wilderness” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-14.htm" title="But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, said the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hemath to the river of the wilderness.">Amos 6:14</a> (here pl. <span class="ital">‘ǎrâbîm</span>, there sing. <span class="ital">‘ǎrâbâh</span>.

Some regard the word here as an irregular pl. of that used by Amos, and render “brook of the wastes.” But the two brooks are not necessarily identical, and even if they are, the translation “willows” (or rather, “poplars”) is perhaps to be preferred. Cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-4.htm" title="And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses.">Isaiah 44:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-2.htm" title="We hanged our harps on the willows in the middle thereof.">Psalm 137:2</a>, &c., for the name of the tree.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the abundance</span>] is lit. “surplus.” <span class="ital">that which they have laid up</span> is in Heb. a single word, meaning something entrusted for safe keeping.

All that he predicts evokes his deepest sympathy, just as if he himself belonged to the unfortunate nation to which he is called to be a messenger of woe. He commences with an utterance of amazement. "Oracle concerning Moab! for in a night 'Ar-Moab is laid waste, destroyed; for in a night Kir-Moab is laid waste, destroyed." The ci (for) is explanatory in both instances, and not simply affirmative, or, as Knobel maintains, recitative, and therefore unmeaning. The prophet justifies the peculiar heading to his prophecy from the horrible vision given him to see, and takes us at once into the very heart of the vision, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1</a>. 'Ar Moab (in which 'Ar is Moabitish for 'Ir; cf., <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a>, where we find 'Ai written instead of 'Ar, which we should naturally expect) is the name of the capital of Moab (Grecized, Areopolis), which was situated to the south of the Arnon, at present a large field of ruins, with a village of the name of Rabba. Kir Moab (in which Kir is the Moabitish for Kiryah) was the chief fortress of Joab, which was situated to the south-east of Ar, the present Kerek, where there is still a town with a fortification upon a rock, which can be seen from Jerusalem with a telescope on a clear day, and forms so thoroughly one mass with the rock, that in 1834, when Ibrahim Pasha resolved to pull it down, he was obliged to relinquish the project. The identity of Kir and Kerek is unquestionable, but that of Ar and Rabba has been disputed; and on the ground of <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-36.htm">Numbers 22:36</a>, where it seems to be placed nearer the Arnon, it has been transposed to the ruins on the pasture land at the confluence of the Lejm and Mujib ( equals  "the city that is by the river" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-16.htm">Joshua 13:16</a> : see Comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-15.htm">Numbers 21:15</a>) - a conjecture which has this against it, that the name Areopolis, which has been formed from Ar, is attached to the "metropolis civitas Ar," which was called Rabba as the metropolis, and of which Jerome relates (on the passage before us), as an event associated with his own childhood, that it was then destroyed by an earthquake (probably in 342). The two names of the cities are used as masculine here, like Dammesek in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1</a>, and Tzor in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1</a>, though it cannot therefore be said, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-1.htm">Micah 5:1</a>, that the city stands for the inhabitants (Ges. Lehrgebude, p. 469). "In a night" (&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; absolute, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-11.htm">Isaiah 21:11</a>, not construct, which would give an illogical assertion, as shuddad and nidma&#770;h are almost coincident, so far as the sense is concerned) the two pillars of the strength of Moab are overthrown. In the space of a night, and therefore very suddenly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-14.htm">Isaiah 17:14</a>), Moab is destroyed. The prophet repeats twice what it would have been quite sufficient to say once, just as if he had been condemned to keep his eye fixed upon the awful spectacle (on the asyndeton, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-9.htm">Isaiah 33:9</a>; and on the anadiplosis, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-8.htm">Isaiah 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-9.htm">Isaiah 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-11.htm">Isaiah 21:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12-13</a>). His first sensation is that of horror. </body></html>
