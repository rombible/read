The consolations and graces of his Spirit are as rivers of water in this dry land; and as the overhanging rock affords refreshing shade and shelter to the weary traveller in the desert, so his power, truth, and love, yield the believer the only real protection and refreshment in the weary land through which he journeys to heaven. Christ bore the storm himself, to keep it off from us. To him let the trembling sinner flee for refuge; for he alone can protect and refresh us in every trial. See what pains sinners take in sin; they labour at it, their hearts are intent upon it, and with art they work iniquity; but this is our comfort, that they can do no more mischief than God permits. Let us seek to have our hearts more freed from selfishness. The liberal soul devises liberal things concerning God, and desires that He will grant wisdom and prudence, the comforts of his presence, the influence of his Spirit, and in due time the enjoyment of his glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The instruments also - In the Hebrew here there is a paronomasia which cannot be imitated in a translation. The word 'instruments' here denotes evidently the means by which the churl accomplishes his object; whether it be by words, by judicial decisions, or by crafty devices. This is also a kind of proverbial expression, and is given as a further reason why such a person would not be employed by a wise and virtuous prince.<p>Are evil - He will make use of any unprincipled means, any wicked plan or device, to accomplish his purpose. "With lying words." With false representations; or with deceitful promises and assurances. His aim would be particularly directed to the poor and humble, as more easily deprived of their rights than the rich and powerful. It was also of greater importance to defend the rights of the poor, and therefore the prophet says that such a person should not be in the employ of a just and virtuous ruler.<p>Even when the needy speaketh right - That is, although the cause of the needy is one of truth and equity. When this would be manifest, the unprincipled man in power would deprive him of his rights, and, therefore, under a wise and virtuous administration, such a person should not be employed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. churl&#8212;"the fraudulent"; this verse refers to the last clause of Isa 32:5; as Isa 32:6 referred to its first clause.<p>speaketh right&#8212;pleadeth a just cause (Isa 29:21); spiritually, "the poor man's cause" is the divine doctrine, his rule of faith and practice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The instruments also of the churl are evil, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">The vessels</span>, &c., which is a word of a very general signification among the Hebrews, and signifies any person or thing which is employed in a man’s use and service.

Righteous government, as a blessing for the people, is the first beneficent fruit. "Behold, the king will reign according to righteousness; and the princes, according to right will they command. And every one will be like a shelter from the wind, and a covert from the storm; like water-brooks in a dry place, like the shadow of a gigantic rock in a languishing land." The kingdom of Asshur is for ever destroyed; but the kingdom of Judah rises out of the state of confusion into which it has fallen through its God - forgetting policy and disregard of justice. King and princes now rule according to the standards that have been divinely appointed and revealed. The Lamed in u&#772;lesa&#770;r&#305;&#772;m (and the princes) is that of reference (quod attinet ad, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-3.htm">Psalm 16:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:4</a>), the exponent of the usual casus abs.

The figures in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a> are the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4</a>. The rock of Asshur (i.e., Sennacherib) has departed, and the princes of Asshur have deserted their standards, merely to save themselves. The king and princes of Judah are now the defence of their nation, and overshadow it like colossal walls of rock. This is the first fruit of the blessing. </body></html>
