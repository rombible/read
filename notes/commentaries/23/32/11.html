The call to repentance includes their stripping themselves of their costly finery, and putting on the “sackcloth” (the word is implied, though not expressed in the Hebrew), which was the outward symbol of repentance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jonah/3-5.htm" title="So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.">Jonah 3:5-8</a>).

Alas! how many careless ones there are, who support self-indulgence by shameful niggardliness! We deserve to be deprived of the supports of life, when we make them the food of lusts. Let such tremble and be troubled. Blessed times shall be brought in by the pouring out of the Spirit from on high; then, and not till then, there will be good times. The present state of the Jews shall continue until a more abundant pouring out of the Spirit from on high. Peace and quietness shall be found in the way and work of righteousness. True satisfaction is to be had only in true religion. And real holiness is real happiness now, and shall be perfect happiness, that is, perfect holiness for ever.

The speaker calls on his female auditors at once to assume the garb of mourners; so certain is the calamity.

"The fool will no more be called a nobleman, nor the crafty a gentleman. For a fool speaks follies, and his heart does godless things, to practise tricks and to speak error against Jehovah, to leave the soul of hungry men empty, and to withhold the drink of thirsty ones. And the craft of a crafty man is evil, who devises stratagems to destroy suffering ones by lying words, even when the needy exhibits his right. But a noble man devises noble things, and to noble things he adheres." Nobility of birth and wealth will give place to nobility of character, so that the former will not exist or not be recognised without the latter. Na&#770;d&#305;&#772;bh is properly one who is noble in character, and then, dropping the ethical meaning, one who is noble by rank. The meaning of the word generosus follows the same course in the opposite direction. Sho&#772;a&#774;&#8219; is the man who is raised to eminence by the possession of property; the gentleman, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-19.htm">Job 34:19</a>. The prophet explains for himself in what sense he uses the words na&#770;bha&#770;l and k&#305;&#772;lai. We see from his explanation that k&#305;&#772;lai neither signifies the covetous, from ku&#772;l (Saad.), nor the spendthrift, from killa&#770;h (Hitzig). Jerome gives the correct rendering, viz., fraudulentus; and Rashi and Kimchi very properly regard it as a contraction of nekh&#305;&#772;lai. It is an adjective form derived from &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;  equals  &#1504;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;, like &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488;  equals  &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-6.htm">Job 20:6</a>). The form &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1</a> is used interchangeably with this, merely for the sake of the resemblance in sound to &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; (machinatoris machinae pravae). In <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-6.htm">Isaiah 32:6</a>, commencing with ki (for), the fact that the na&#770;bha&#770;l (fool) and k&#305;&#772;lai (crafty man) will lose their titles of honour, is explained on the simple ground that such men are utterly unworthy of them. Na&#770;bha&#770;l is a scoffer at religion, who thinks himself an enlightened man, and yet at the same time has the basest heart, and is a worthless egotist. The infinitives with Lamed show in what the immorality ('a&#770;ven) consists, with which his heart is so actively employed. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-6.htm">Isaiah 32:6</a>, u&#772;bhedabbe&#772;r ("and if he speak") is equivalent to, "even in the event of a needy man saying what is right and well founded:" Va&#770;v  equals  et in the sense of etiam ((cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-12.htm">Psalm 31:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-6.htm">Hosea 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:6</a>); according to Knobel, it is equivalent to et quidem, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-11.htm">Amos 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-10.htm">Amos 4:10</a>; whereas Ewald regards it as Vav conj. (283, d), "and by going to law with the needy," but &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; would be the construction in this case (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-6.htm">2 Kings 25:6</a>). According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-8.htm">Isaiah 32:8</a>, not only does the noble man devise what is noble, but as such (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;) he adheres to it. We might also adopt this explanation, "It is not upon gold or upon chance that he rises;" but according to the Arabic equivalents, qu&#772;m signifies persistere here. </body></html>
