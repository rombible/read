Alas! how many careless ones there are, who support self-indulgence by shameful niggardliness! We deserve to be deprived of the supports of life, when we make them the food of lusts. Let such tremble and be troubled. Blessed times shall be brought in by the pouring out of the Spirit from on high; then, and not till then, there will be good times. The present state of the Jews shall continue until a more abundant pouring out of the Spirit from on high. Peace and quietness shall be found in the way and work of righteousness. True satisfaction is to be had only in true religion. And real holiness is real happiness now, and shall be perfect happiness, that is, perfect holiness for ever.

The marginal readling has originated from the supposition that the word &#1499;&#1497;  k&#305;&#770;y is derived from &#1499;&#1497;&#1492;  ka&#770;va&#770;h, "to be burned." This conjecture has been adopted by Junius and Tremellius, and by some others. But it is evidently mere conjecture, and is not demanded. The word 'yea' will express the sense, meaning that desolation, indicated by the growth of thorns and briers, would come upon the cities that were then filled with joy. This does not refer to Jerusalem, which was not taken by Sennacherib, but to the other cities that were destroyed by him in his march, and this account accords with the statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-20.htm">Isaiah 7:20-25</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

The curse of the earth, the spontaneous productions of it, being uncultivated, and this through want of men, they being destroyed or carried captive by the enemy; this is to be understood of the land of Judea, and not Samaria, as Aben Ezra; where the professing and covenant people of God dwelt; which is mentioned to show the apostasy of this people, for which ruin came upon their land, and the aggravation of it, as well as the goodness of God to them, which continued to the last, still considering them as his people. This respects not the desolation of the country by the Assyrian army, nor by the Chaldeans, but rather by the Romans, even their last destruction: <p>yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city; not Samaria, the head of the ten tribes, as some; but Jerusalem, the joy of the whole earth, as Jarchi; and the "houses of joy" in it mean not public houses, as taverns, and the like, where persons meet to revel and carouse, but the houses of nobles, princes, and rich men, who lived voluptuously, in great sensuality and carnal mirth, drinking wine in bowls, and chanting to the sound of the viol, and using all instruments of music; but now their houses, in which they enjoyed so much pleasure, should be demolished, and briers and thorns should grow upon the spot where they stood. Some render the word  "burning", as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-24.htm">Isaiah 3:24</a> "burning shall be on all the houses" (o), &amp;c.; and think it refers to the burning of the city of Jerusalem, and the palaces or houses of nobles and rich men in it, which was done both by the Chaldeans and by the Romans. <p>(o) Junius &amp; Tremellius, Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/32.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">Upon the land … briers</span>] It is perhaps better to take this as continuing <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-12.htm" title="They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.">Isaiah 32:12</a></span>, rendering thus: <span class="bld">For the</span> (<span class="bld">cultivated</span>) <span class="bld">land of my people, which goes up in thorns and briers</span> (cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-6.htm" title="And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor dig; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain on it.">Isaiah 5:6</a>); <span class="bld">yea, for all</span>, &c.

The women require, like the men, to be both warned and comforted, wherefore the prophet addresses to them, as to the men in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30</a>. and 31, an intermixture of threatening (vers. 13, 14) with promise (vers. 15-20). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briars.</span> This was the punishment with which the unfruitful vineyard was threatened in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>.

"The fool will no more be called a nobleman, nor the crafty a gentleman. For a fool speaks follies, and his heart does godless things, to practise tricks and to speak error against Jehovah, to leave the soul of hungry men empty, and to withhold the drink of thirsty ones. And the craft of a crafty man is evil, who devises stratagems to destroy suffering ones by lying words, even when the needy exhibits his right. But a noble man devises noble things, and to noble things he adheres." Nobility of birth and wealth will give place to nobility of character, so that the former will not exist or not be recognised without the latter. Na&#770;d&#305;&#772;bh is properly one who is noble in character, and then, dropping the ethical meaning, one who is noble by rank. The meaning of the word generosus follows the same course in the opposite direction. Sho&#772;a&#774;&#8219; is the man who is raised to eminence by the possession of property; the gentleman, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-19.htm">Job 34:19</a>. The prophet explains for himself in what sense he uses the words na&#770;bha&#770;l and k&#305;&#772;lai. We see from his explanation that k&#305;&#772;lai neither signifies the covetous, from ku&#772;l (Saad.), nor the spendthrift, from killa&#770;h (Hitzig). Jerome gives the correct rendering, viz., fraudulentus; and Rashi and Kimchi very properly regard it as a contraction of nekh&#305;&#772;lai. It is an adjective form derived from &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;  equals  &#1504;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;, like &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488;  equals  &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-6.htm">Job 20:6</a>). The form &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1</a> is used interchangeably with this, merely for the sake of the resemblance in sound to &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; (machinatoris machinae pravae). In <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-6.htm">Isaiah 32:6</a>, commencing with ki (for), the fact that the na&#770;bha&#770;l (fool) and k&#305;&#772;lai (crafty man) will lose their titles of honour, is explained on the simple ground that such men are utterly unworthy of them. Na&#770;bha&#770;l is a scoffer at religion, who thinks himself an enlightened man, and yet at the same time has the basest heart, and is a worthless egotist. The infinitives with Lamed show in what the immorality ('a&#770;ven) consists, with which his heart is so actively employed. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-6.htm">Isaiah 32:6</a>, u&#772;bhedabbe&#772;r ("and if he speak") is equivalent to, "even in the event of a needy man saying what is right and well founded:" Va&#770;v  equals  et in the sense of etiam ((cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-12.htm">Psalm 31:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-6.htm">Hosea 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:6</a>); according to Knobel, it is equivalent to et quidem, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-11.htm">Amos 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-10.htm">Amos 4:10</a>; whereas Ewald regards it as Vav conj. (283, d), "and by going to law with the needy," but &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; would be the construction in this case (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-6.htm">2 Kings 25:6</a>). According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-8.htm">Isaiah 32:8</a>, not only does the noble man devise what is noble, but as such (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;) he adheres to it. We might also adopt this explanation, "It is not upon gold or upon chance that he rises;" but according to the Arabic equivalents, qu&#772;m signifies persistere here. </body></html>
