The state of the Christian Church, during the dark and persecuting ages of Popery, is here described, in language borrowed from Jerusalem lying in desolation. <span class="ital">I will make thee an eternal excellency </span>— Being reformed from idolatry and other superstitions and abominations, and thy members being enlightened with the truth, and regenerated by the grace of God, and thereby rendered wise and holy, thou shalt be blessed and exalted with continual tokens of the divine favour, and made a lasting and increasing blessing in the world. The Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">לגאון עולם</span>, is literally, <span class="ital">for a lifting up, </span>or, <span class="ital">an exaltation, continually, </span>or, <span class="ital">for ever. A joy of many generations</span> — Hebrew, <span class="ital">Of generation and generation. </span>The meaning is, that the church’s prosperity and happiness should be the rejoicing and comfort of many succeeding ages, or the matter of their great and continual rejoicing. Bishop Lowth translates this clause, <span class="ital">I will make thee an everlasting boast, a subject of joy for perpetual generations. </span>It cannot be said of the Jewish nation, since this was uttered, that it has in any degree answered these characters. For after their restoration to their own land, they were first in subjection to the Persians, afterward to the Macedonians, the successors of Alexander the Great; whose yoke they had scarcely shaken off, when they fell under the power of the Romans, who treated them with great severity, and at last destroyed them, together with their city of Jerusalem, almost to an entire extirpation. So that we are compelled to look for the accomplishment of this prophecy in the Christian Church, the perpetual excellences of which far exceed those of the Jewish, and in the glorious privileges and blessings of the religion of Christ, which are indeed, and will be, <span class="ital">the joy of many generations.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/60.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>60:15-22 We must look for the full accomplishment in times and things, exceeding those of the Old Testament church. The nations and their kings shall lay themselves out for the good of the church. Such a salvation, such a redemption, shall be wrought out for thee, as discovers itself to be the work of the Lord. Every thing shall be changed for the better. In thy land shall no more be heard threats of those that do violence, nor complaints of those that suffer violence. Thy walls shall be means of safety, thy gates shall be written upon with praises to God. In the close of this chapter are images and expressions used in the description of the New Jerusalem, Re 21:23; 22:5. Nothing can answer to this but some future glorious state of the church on earth, or the state of the church triumphant in heaven. Those that make God their only light, shall have him their all-sufficient light. And the happiness shall know no change or alloy. No people on earth are all righteous; but there are no mixtures in heaven. They shall be wholly righteous. The spirits of just men shall there be made perfect. The glory of the church shall be to the honour of God. When it shall be finished, it will appear a work of wonder. It may seem too difficult to be brought about, but the God of almighty power has undertaken it. It may seem to be delayed and put off; but the Lord will hasten it in the time appointed by his wisdom, though not in the time prescribed by our folly. Let this hope cheer us under all difficulties, and stir us up to all diligence, that we may have an abundant entrance into this everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/60.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whereas thou hast been forsaken - Hebrew, 'Instead of (&#1514;&#1495;&#1514;  tachath) thy being forsaken,' that is, thy subsequent prosperity shall come in the place of thy being formerly forsaken.

Zion has been a wife repudiated for her adulteries, "forsaken" by her husband, and the object of his just "hate." So that no man went through thee. The mixed metaphor is awkward, but readily intelligible. Zion is at once a city and a wife. As a wife, she is "hated and forsaken," as a city, no man goes through her.

"Who are these who fly hither as a cloud, and like the doves to their windows? Yea, the islands wait for me; and the ships of Tarshish come first, to bring thy children from far, their silver and gold with them, to the name of thy God, and to the holy One of Israel, because He hath ornamented thee." Upon the sea there appear first of all enigmatical shapes, driving along as swiftly as if they were light clouds flying before the wind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-22.htm">Isaiah 45:22</a>), or like doves flying to their dovecots (celeres cavis se turribus abdunt, as Ovid says), i.e., to the round towers with their numerous pigeon-holes, which are provided for their shelter. The question is addressed to Zion, and the answer may easily be anticipated - namely, that this swarm of swiftly flying figures are hurrying to a house which they long to reach, as much as pigeons do to reach their pigeon-house. The k&#305;&#772; which follows is explanatory: this hurrying presents itself to thine eyes, because the isles wait for me. The reason for all this haste is to be found in the faith of those who are hurrying on. The Old Testament generally speaks of faith as hope (&#1500; &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-5.htm">Isaiah 51:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-4.htm">Isaiah 42:4</a>); not that faith is the same as hope, but it is the support of hope, just as hope is the comfort of faith. In the Old Testament, when the true salvation existed only in promise, this epithet, for which there were many synonyms in the language, was the most appropriate one. The faith of the distant lands of the west is now beginning to work. The object of all this activity is expressed in the word &#1500;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;. The things thus flying along like clouds and doves are ships; with the Tartessus ships, which come from the farthest extremity of the European insular quarter of the globe, at their head (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; with munach instead of metheg, in the same sense as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-14.htm">Numbers 10:14</a>; lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;; Jerome, in principio, in the foremost rank), i.e., acting as the leaders of the fleet which is sailing to Zion and bringing Zion's children from afar, and along with them the gold and silver of the owners of the vessels themselves, to the name (&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, to the name, dative, not equivalent to &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503;; lxx &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-5.htm">Isaiah 55:5</a>) of thy God, whom they adore, and to the Holy One of Israel, because He hath ornamented thee, and thereby inspired them with reverence and love to thee (&#1508;&#1488;&#1512;&#1498; for &#1508;&#1488;&#1512;&#1498;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-6.htm">Isaiah 54:6</a>, where it even stands out of pause). </body></html>
