And if God's glory is seen upon us to our honour, we ought, not only with our lips, but in our lives, to return its praise. We meet with nothing in the history of the Jews which can be deemed a fulfilment of the prophecy in this chapter; we must conclude it relates principally to future events. It predicts the purity and enlargement of the church. The conversion of souls is here described. They fly to Christ, to the church, to the word and ordinances, as doves to their own home; thither they fly for refuge and shelter, thither they fly for rest.

She is directed to lift them up, and to see the great multitudes that were flocking to her. Wherever she could turn her eyes, she would behold them hastening to come to her. In this verse and the following verses, the prophet goes into a particular statement of what he referred to in general terms in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>. The first thing which be specifies is, that the dispersed sons and daughters of the Jewish people would be gathered back.<p>Thy sons shall come from far - They who have been driven into exile into distant lands shall again return. This is in accordance with the predictions so often made in Isaiah, that the scattered sons of the Jewish people would be again collected (see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-17.htm">Isaiah 49:17-18</a>.)<p>And thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side - The Septuagint renders this, 'And thy daughters shall be borne upon the shoulders' (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3c9;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  ep' o&#772;mo&#772;n arthe&#772;sontai). Lowth also says, that one manuscript reads it 'upon shoulders,' and another has both 'shoulder' and 'side.' The translation of the Septuagint, and these different readings of the manuscripts have probably been caused by the supposed improbability of the fact, that children were nursed or carried on the side (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-22.htm">Isaiah 49:22</a>). But Sir John Chardin says that it is the general custom in the East to carry the children astride upon the hip, with the arms around the body. The word, however, which is rendered 'nursed' in our translation (&#1514;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492;  te&#772;'a&#770;mana&#770;h from           &#1488;&#1502;&#1503;  'a&#770;man), means, properly, "to stay, to sustain, support; to bear or carry a child" <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-12.htm">Numbers 11:12</a>; hence, "to be faithful, firm." It is not certain that it is in any instance used in the sense of nursing; but it more probably means here, they shall be borne. It implies that the church would evince deep solicitude for the education and welfare of the young - as a mother does for her children; and that it would be one of the blessings of those times that that solicitude should be felt and manifested. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/60.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

"And they will fear the name of Jehovah from the west, and His glory from the rising of the sun: for He will come like a stream dammed up, which a tempest of Jehovah drives away. And a Redeemer comes for Zion, and for those who turn from apostasy in Jacob, saith Jehovah." Instead of &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, Knobel would strike out the metheg, and read &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, "and they will see;" but "seeing the name of Jehovah" (the usual expression is "seeing His glory") is a phrase that cannot be met with, though it is certainly a passable one; and the relation in which <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-19.htm">Isaiah 59:19</a> stands to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-19.htm">Isaiah 59:19</a> does not recommend the alteration, since <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-19.htm">Isaiah 59:19</a> attributes that general fear of the name of Jehovah (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-58.htm">Deuteronomy 28:58</a>) and of His glory (see the parallel overlooked by Knobel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-16.htm">Psalm 102:16</a>), which follows the manifestation of judgment on the part of Jehovah, to the manner in which this manifestation occurs. Moreover, the true Masoretic reading in this passage is not &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-17.htm">Micah 7:17</a>), but &#1493;&#1497;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493; (see Norzi). The two &#1502;&#1503; in &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489; (with the indispensable metheg before the chateph, and a second to ensure clearness of pronunciation)<p>(Note: See the law in Br's Metheg-Setzung, 29.)<p>and &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1495;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473; (also with the so-called strong metheg)<p>(Note: See idem, 28.)<p>indicate the terminus a quo. From all quarters of the globe will fear of the name and of the glory of Jehovah become naturalized among the nations of the world. For when God has withdrawn His name and His glory from the world's history, as during the Babylonian captivity (and also at the present time), the return of both is all the more intense and extraordinary; and this is represented here in a figure which recals <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27-28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22-23</a> (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>). The accentuation, which gives pashta to &#1499;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;, does indeed appear to make &#1510;&#1512; the subject, either in the sense of oppressor or adversary, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-12.htm">Lamentations 4:12</a>, or in that of oppression, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-16.htm">Isaiah 26:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-20.htm">Isaiah 30:20</a>. The former is quite out of the question, since no such transition to a human instrument of the retributive judgment could well take place after the &#1500;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; &#1495;&#1502;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-18.htm">Isaiah 59:18</a>. In support of the latter, it would be possible to quote <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-18.htm">Isaiah 48:18</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-12.htm">Isaiah 66:12</a>, since &#1510;&#1512; is the antithesis to sha&#770;lo&#772;m. But according to such parallels as <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27-28</a>, it is incomparably more natural to take Jehovah (His name, His glory) as the subject. Moreover, &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;, which must in any case refer to &#1499;&#1504;&#1492;&#1512;, is opposed to the idea that &#1510;&#1512; is the subject, to which &#1489;&#1493; would have the most natural claim to be referred - an explanation indeed which Stier and Hahn have really tried, taking &#1504;&#1493;&#1505;&#1505;&#1495; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-4.htm">Psalm 60:4</a>, and rendering it "The Spirit of Jehovah holds up a banner against him, viz., the enemy." If, however, Jehovah is the subject to &#1497;&#1489;&#1488;, &#1510;&#1512; &#1499;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512; must be taken together (like &#1502;&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; ... &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1498;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-10.htm">Psalm 143:10</a>; Ges. 111, 2, b), either in the sense of "a hemming stream," one causing as it were a state of siege (from tsu&#772;r, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-3.htm">Isaiah 29:3</a>), or, better still, according to the adjective use of the noun &#1510;&#1512; (here with tzakeph, &#1510;&#1512; from &#1510;&#1512;&#1512;) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-20.htm">Isaiah 28:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-7.htm">Job 41:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-1.htm">2 Kings 6:1</a>, a closely confined stream, to whose waters the banks form a compressing dam, which it bursts through when agitated by a tempest, carrying everything away with it. <p>Accordingly, the explanation we adopt is this: Jehovah will come like the stream, a stream hemmed in, which a wind of Jehovah, i.e., (like "the mountains of God," "cedars of God," "garden of Jehovah," <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-3.htm">Isaiah 51:3</a>, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-6.htm">Numbers 24:6</a>) a strong tempestuous wind, sweeps away (&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; &#1504;&#1505;&#1505;&#1492;, no&#772;sesa-b-bo&#770;, with the tone drawn back and dagesh forte conj. in the monosyllable, the pilel of nu&#772;s with Beth: to hunt into, to press upon and put to flight) - a figure which also indicates that the Spirit of Jehovah is the driving force in this His judicially gracious revelation of Himself. Then, when the name of Jehovah makes itself legible once more as with letters of fire, when His glory comes like a sea of fire within the horizon of the world's history, all the world form west to east, from east to west, will begin to fear Him. But the true object of the love, which bursts forth through this revelation of wrath, is His church, which includes not only those who have retained their faith, but all who have been truly converted to Him. And He comes (&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;) a continuation of &#1497;&#1489;&#1488;) for Zion a Redeemer, i.e., as a Redeemer (a closer definition of the predicate), and for those who turn away from apostasy (&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;, compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-27.htm">Isaiah 1:27</a>, and for the genitive connection <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/2-8.htm">Micah 2:8</a>, &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;, those who have turned away form the war). The Vav here does not signify "and indeed," as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-18.htm">Isaiah 57:18</a>, but "more especially." He comes as a Redeemer for Zion, i.e., His church which has remained true, including those who turn again to Jehovah from their previous apostasy. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a> the apostle quotes this word of God, which is sealed with "Thus saith Jehovah," as a proof of the final restoration of all Israel; for &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; (according to the Apocalypse, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c9;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) is to him the God who moves on through the Old Testament towards the goal of His incarnation, and through the New Testament towards that of His parousia in Christ, which will bring the world's history to a close. But this final close does not take place without its having become apparent at the same time that God "has concluded all in unbelief that He may have compassion upon all" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-32.htm">Romans 11:32</a>). </body></html>
