And if God's glory is seen upon us to our honour, we ought, not only with our lips, but in our lives, to return its praise. We meet with nothing in the history of the Jews which can be deemed a fulfilment of the prophecy in this chapter; we must conclude it relates principally to future events. It predicts the purity and enlargement of the church. The conversion of souls is here described. They fly to Christ, to the church, to the word and ordinances, as doves to their own home; thither they fly for refuge and shelter, thither they fly for rest. What a pleasant sight to see poor souls hastening to Christ!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/60.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All the flocks of Kedar - On the word 'Kedar,' see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-16.htm">Isaiah 21:16</a>. The Kedarenians were a wandering tribe that frequently changed their residence, though it is probable they usually dwelt in the south part of Arabia Deserta, or the north of Arabia Petraea. They are mentioned as dwelling in beautiful tents Sol 1:5 : 'I am black, but comely as the tents of Kedar,' see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-5.htm">Psalm 120:5</a>; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-16.htm">Isaiah 21:16-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-11.htm">Isaiah 42:11</a>. The language here also means that that which constituted their principal wealth would come and enrich Jerusalem, or the church of God.<p>The rams of Nebaioth - Nebaioth was also a son of Ishmael <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-29.htm">1 Chronicles 1:29</a>, and was the father of the Nabatheans. They were a people of Arabia Petraea, and lived principally by plunder, trade, and the keeping of flocks. The country of Nabathea extended, it is supposed, from the Euphrates to the Red Sea, and embraced Petra, the capital of Arabia Deserts, and also Medaba. It is not possible, however, to fix the exact boundaries of the various tribes of Arabians. The general idea is, that their most valuable possessions would be devoted to God.<p>Shall minister unto thee - That is, by coming up as an acceptable sacrifice on the altar.<p>They shall come up with acceptance on mine altar - It is by no means necessary to understand this literally. The Jews were accustomed to express their ideas of worship by sacrifices, and the prophet naturally employed that language. The sense is, that the conversion of the wandering tribes of Arabia would be as certain and as signal as if the numerous flocks of Kedar and Nebaioth should be devoted to Yahweh in sacrifice. All that was valuable there would be employed in his service; the people would come with their most precious offerings and consecrate them to God. It is evident that this remains to be fulfilled. Paul, indeed, preached in Arabia <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17</a>; and, doubtless, there were some conversions to Christianity there. But, as a people, they never have been converted to the true God; and in all ages they have been the victims of either idolatry or superstition. The time will come, however, when Arabia, so interesting as settled by the descendants of Abraham; so interesting in the bold, active, and energetic character of its tribes; so interesting as using a language that is one of the most refined and far-spoken of the earth; and so interesting as being, in some parts at least, among the most fertile and beautiful of the earth, shall be converted to God. Probably the most balmy, pure, and pleasant climate of the world is the southern part of Arabia Felix - the country of Yemen; and when the Arabs shall bring their energy of character to the service of the true God, and the gospel shall be preached in their language to all their tribes, no one can predict the effect which this shall have on the entire conversion of the world.<p>And I will glorify - I will honor my glorious house, that is, the temple. Lowth, 'And my beauteous house I will yet beautify.' The idea is, that he would adorn the temple by bringing the distant nations, with their most valuable possessions, to worship there. That is, the true religion would yet appear glorious when the nation should acknowledge it and submit to its requirements. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/60.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

The identification of the latter tribe with the Nabatæans of the classical writers is disputed by some eminent authorities, but it is at least a significant circumstance that “Nabataei et Cedrei” are bracketed together by Pliny, as Nabaitai and Kidrai are associated in Assyrian inscriptions (Schrader, <span class="ital">Cuneiform Inscriptions</span>, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-13.htm" title="And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,">Genesis 25:13</a> f.).

During the Maccabee period we find the Nabataeans in alliance with the Jews, and giving them some valuable assistance (1 Macc. 5:25 1 Macc. 9:35). The locality of the Nabataeans was northern Arabia, or the tract lying between the Elanitic Gulf and the Lower Euphrates. The wealth of the Nabataeans and the Kedarenes was in their flocks and herds; and this wealth, it is prophesied, they will place, at the disposal of Israel<span class="cmt_word">.

The renovated Zion contains a glorious temple, and the temple has in it an altar, to which the sheep and rams are brought - not, however, to be offered in sacrifice, but to be presented to God and become a part of the wealth of the Church. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/60.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>It is still night. The inward and outward condition of the church is night; and if it is night followed by a morning, it is so only for those who "against hope believe in hope." The reality which strikes the senses is the night of sin, of punishment, of suffering, and of mourning - a long night of nearly seventy years. In this night, the prophet, according to the command of God, has bee prophesying of the coming light. In his inward penetration of the substance of his own preaching, he has come close to the time when faith is to be turned to sight. And now in the strength of God, who has made him the mouthpiece of His own creative fiat, he exclaims to the church, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1</a> : "Arise, grow light; for thy light cometh, and the glory of Jehovah riseth upon thee." The appeal so addressed to Zion-Jerusalem, which is regarded (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-1.htm">Isaiah 50:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-1.htm">Isaiah 52:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-1.htm">Isaiah 54:1</a>) as a woman, and indeed as the mother of Israel. Here, however, it is regarded as the church redeemed from banishment, and settled once more in the holy city and the holy land, the church of salvation, which is now about to become the church of glory. Zion lies prostrate on the ground, smitten down by the judgment of God, brought down to the ground by inward prostration, and partly overcome by the sleep of self-security. She now hears the cry, "Arise" (qu&#772;m&#305;&#772;). This is not a mere admonition, but a word of power which puts new life into her limbs, so that she is able to rise from the ground, on which she has lain, as it were, under the ban. The night, which has brought her to the ground mourning, and faint, and intoxicated with sleep, is now at an end. The mighty word qu&#772;m&#305;&#772;, "arise," is supplemented by a second word: 'o&#772;r&#305;&#772;. What creative force there is in these two trochees, qu&#772;m&#305;&#772; 'o&#772;r&#305;&#772;, which hold on, as it were, till what they express is accomplished; and what force of consolation in the two iambi, ki-bha&#770; 'o&#772;re&#772;kh, which affix, as it were, to the acts of Zion the seal of the divine act, and add to the &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (or elevation) its &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (or foundation)! Zion is to become light; it is to, because it can. But it cannot of itself, for in itself it has no light, because it has so absolutely given itself up to sin; but there is a light which will communicate itself to her, viz., the light which radiates from the holy nature of God Himself. And this light is salvation, because the Holy One loves Zion: it is also glory, because it not only dispels the darkness, but sets itself, all glorious as it is, in the place of the darkness. Za&#770;rach is the word commonly applied to the rising of the sun (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>). The sun of suns is Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-12.htm">Psalm 84:12</a>), the God who is coming (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-20.htm">Isaiah 59:20</a>). </body></html>
