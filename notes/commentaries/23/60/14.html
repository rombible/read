It seems better, however, to see in the words an expression of the law of inherited retribution, which entered so largely into the Hebrew’s thought of the moral government of the world. That law will show itself in the prostrate homage with which the descendants of the old oppressors will recognise that the restored city is indeed the Zion of the Holy One of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/60.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-14.htm" title="The sons also of them that afflicted you shall come bending to you; and all they that despised you shall bow themselves down at the soles of your feet; and they shall call you; The city of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.">Isaiah 60:14</a></span>. <span class="ital">The sons of them, that afflicted thee — </span>Their posterity, or themselves, for it is the manner of the Hebrews so to speak; <span class="ital">shall come bending unto thee </span>— Humbling themselves as penitents, and thus manifesting their respect and reverence for thee.

But those who will not be subject to Christ's golden sceptre, to his word and Spirit, who will not be kept in by the laws and rules of his family, shall be broken in pieces by his iron rod. The peculiar advantages of every nation, and of every description of men, shall join to beautify the church of Christ.

Here, to give variety and interest to the description, he says, that even the descendants of those who had oppressed them would become tributary to them, and acknowledge them as favored by Yahweh.<p>Shall come bending unto thee - Shall come to time in a posture of humiliation and respect, In regard to the fulfillment of this, we may observe:<p>1. That there was a partial fulfillment of it in the conquest of Babylon. The sons, the descendants of those who had destroyed Jerusalem, and led the Jews into captivity, were constrained to acknowledge them, and, under Cyrus, to reconduct them to the land of their fathers (see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-1.htm">Isaiah 14:1-2</a>).<p>2. It has often occurred, in times of persecution, that the immediate descendants of the persecutors, and that too by means of the persecution, became converted to the true religion, and acknowledged the God of those whom they bad persecuted to be the true God.<p>3. It often occurs in times when there is no open and public persecution. Many of those now in the church are the children or descendants of those who had been the enemies of the gospel. They themselves did all that could be done, by their lives and examples, to train up their children in opposition to it. But the sovereign mercy of God interposed, and from such he selected heralds of salvation and preachers of righteousness to a lost world, or such as should become shining lights in the more obscure walks of the Christian life.<p>And all they that despised thee - There shall yet be a universal acknowledgment of the true religion even in those nations that have spurned the gospel. This does not mean that all who have ever despised the true religion shall be converted and saved, but that there shall be a universal acknowledgement that it is of God, and that the church is under his care.

"Who are these who fly hither as a cloud, and like the doves to their windows? Yea, the islands wait for me; and the ships of Tarshish come first, to bring thy children from far, their silver and gold with them, to the name of thy God, and to the holy One of Israel, because He hath ornamented thee." Upon the sea there appear first of all enigmatical shapes, driving along as swiftly as if they were light clouds flying before the wind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-22.htm">Isaiah 45:22</a>), or like doves flying to their dovecots (celeres cavis se turribus abdunt, as Ovid says), i.e., to the round towers with their numerous pigeon-holes, which are provided for their shelter. The question is addressed to Zion, and the answer may easily be anticipated - namely, that this swarm of swiftly flying figures are hurrying to a house which they long to reach, as much as pigeons do to reach their pigeon-house. The k&#305;&#772; which follows is explanatory: this hurrying presents itself to thine eyes, because the isles wait for me. The reason for all this haste is to be found in the faith of those who are hurrying on. The Old Testament generally speaks of faith as hope (&#1500; &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-5.htm">Isaiah 51:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-4.htm">Isaiah 42:4</a>); not that faith is the same as hope, but it is the support of hope, just as hope is the comfort of faith. In the Old Testament, when the true salvation existed only in promise, this epithet, for which there were many synonyms in the language, was the most appropriate one. The faith of the distant lands of the west is now beginning to work. The object of all this activity is expressed in the word &#1500;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;. The things thus flying along like clouds and doves are ships; with the Tartessus ships, which come from the farthest extremity of the European insular quarter of the globe, at their head (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; with munach instead of metheg, in the same sense as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-14.htm">Numbers 10:14</a>; lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;; Jerome, in principio, in the foremost rank), i.e., acting as the leaders of the fleet which is sailing to Zion and bringing Zion's children from afar, and along with them the gold and silver of the owners of the vessels themselves, to the name (&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, to the name, dative, not equivalent to &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503;; lxx &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-5.htm">Isaiah 55:5</a>) of thy God, whom they adore, and to the Holy One of Israel, because He hath ornamented thee, and thereby inspired them with reverence and love to thee (&#1508;&#1488;&#1512;&#1498; for &#1508;&#1488;&#1512;&#1498;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-6.htm">Isaiah 54:6</a>, where it even stands out of pause). </body></html>
