The sense is, that the church should draw, or receive, the wealth of nations, and the riches and power of kings, and whatever is most excellent; and that it should come freely and affectionately, as milk flows from the breast of the mother. <span class="ital">And thou shalt know </span>— Namely, shall experience; <span class="ital">that I the Lord</span> — Hebrew, <span class="ital">Jehovah; am thy Saviour </span>— That I have undertaken to save, and that I do and will save thee; <span class="ital">the mighty One of Jacob </span>— Not only of the literal, but also, and especially, of the spiritual Jacob, or Israel: as if he had said, These things will certainly be accomplished, for he is <span class="ital">the mighty God, </span>and so is able; and <span class="ital">the God of Jacob, </span>and so is obliged by covenant with, and relation to them, to deliver and protect his people. <span class="ital">For brass I will bring gold, </span>&c. — Here we have the effect of the preceding promise: Thy poverty shall be turned to riches, all things shall be altered for the best: it is an allusion to the days of Solomon, when gold was as plentiful as brass. If these words be considered as intended to be taken literally, it is sufficiently evident that they are not applicable to Jerusalem, which was never so enriched, after it was rebuilt, as to have greater riches than the Jews possessed before the wars which they waged with the Babylonians; nor was their state happier. And after Herod the Great, they were in a much worse condition, Judea being reduced to a province of the Roman empire, and governed and pillaged by the deputies or vicegerents of the emperors. Therefore all this is undoubtedly spoken of the Christian Church and of spiritual riches, namely, the privileges and blessings of the gospel. <span class="ital">I will also make thy officers peace </span>— That is, <span class="ital">men of peace, loving, meek, </span>and <span class="ital">friendly. </span>This was far from being the case with the Jews after their return out of captivity; for, though those who were first set over them, after their return, namely, Zerubbabel, Nehemiah, and others, governed them peaceably and mildly, yet it was not so in the following times; and after their high-priests took upon them the government, they grievously plundered and oppressed the people, and contended with one another with the most outrageous and cruel discord, as appears from Josephus, the Jewish historian. But the governors of the Christian Church, that is, of that church which only deserves the name of Christian, have been, and always will be, mild and gentle, and men of peace and clemency. <span class="ital">And thine exactors </span>— Or <span class="ital">rulers, </span>as Dr. Waterland renders <span class="greekheb">נגשׂי</span>Š. <span class="ital">Righteousness </span>— Most righteous, as before <span class="ital">peace </span>was put for peaceable.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/60.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>60:15-22 We must look for the full accomplishment in times and things, exceeding those of the Old Testament church. The nations and their kings shall lay themselves out for the good of the church. Such a salvation, such a redemption, shall be wrought out for thee, as discovers itself to be the work of the Lord. Every thing shall be changed for the better. In thy land shall no more be heard threats of those that do violence, nor complaints of those that suffer violence. Thy walls shall be means of safety, thy gates shall be written upon with praises to God. In the close of this chapter are images and expressions used in the description of the New Jerusalem, Re 21:23; 22:5. Nothing can answer to this but some future glorious state of the church on earth, or the state of the church triumphant in heaven. Those that make God their only light, shall have him their all-sufficient light. And the happiness shall know no change or alloy. No people on earth are all righteous; but there are no mixtures in heaven. They shall be wholly righteous. The spirits of just men shall there be made perfect. The glory of the church shall be to the honour of God. When it shall be finished, it will appear a work of wonder. It may seem too difficult to be brought about, but the God of almighty power has undertaken it. It may seem to be delayed and put off; but the Lord will hasten it in the time appointed by his wisdom, though not in the time prescribed by our folly. Let this hope cheer us under all difficulties, and stir us up to all diligence, that we may have an abundant entrance into this everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/60.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou shalt suck the milk of the Gentiles - This expression means, 'Whatever is valuable and rich which they possess shall contribute to your welfare.' The idea is the same substantially which occurs in the previous parts of the chapter, that the riches of the pagan world would become tributary to the advancement of the true religion.<p>And thou shall suck the breast of kings - The Chaldee renders this, 'And thou shalt be satisfied with the riches of the people, and shalt delight thyself with the spoil of kings.' The phrase to suck 'the breast of kings is unusual; but the sense is simple and plain, that kings and their wealth should be made to contribute to sustain the church. See the sentiment explained in the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-23.htm">Isaiah 49:23</a>.<p>And thou shalt know - By the protection which shall be extended to thee, and by the accession which shall be made to thee, thou shalt have full proof that Yahweh is thy protector and friend. The conversion of the pagan world shall demonstrate that Yahweh is the friend of his church and people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/60.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. suck&#8212;Thou shalt draw to thyself and enjoy all that is valuable of the possessions of the Gentiles, &c.

Partake of their riches and wealth; so the Targum, <p>"and ye shall be satisfied with the substance of the people:'' <p>or drink of the sincere milk of the word of the Gospel, which Gentiles have been favoured with for many ages; for this seems to have regard to Jewish converts, though not to them only, but as they, with the converted Gentiles, will make up one church state, and partake of the same privileges: <p>and shall suck the breast of kings; who shall now be converted in various places, come into the church, and be nursing fathers to it; help and assist the people of God with their riches to carry on divine worship in an honourable manner; and to protect and defend them with their power; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-9.htm">Psalm 72:9</a>. The Targum is, <p>"in the spoil of kings ye shall delight yourselves;'' <p>and it may also design the breasts of consolation, the ordinances of the Gospel, such as Christian kings will suck, and Jews and Gentiles shall do the same, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-11.htm">Isaiah 66:11</a>, <p>and thou shalt know that I the Lord am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob; the Jews, being called, shall seek the Lord their God, the true Messiah, and shall look unto him by faith, whom they have pierced; shall know, own, and acknowledge him to be their Redeemer and Saviour; who must be fit and qualified for such an office and work, and equal to it, being the mighty One of Jacob, whom before they and their ancestors rejected and despised. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/60.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the LORD <i>am</i> thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.</span><p>(q) Both high and low will be ready to help and comfort you.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/60.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>.

As a   child at the mother's breast, thou shall obtain kindly nourishment through the means of the Gentiles, who acknowledge thee for their superior, and place all their means at thy disposal (<span class="accented">supra</span>, vers. 5-11). Among these, the most liberal, and the most prompt to render aid, will be their kings (see the comment on ver. 10). Thou shall know that I the Lord am thy Saviour. This clause is repeated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>. It is a phrase containing in it a mysterious depth of promise. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/60.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The first turn (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1-3</a>) described the glorification of Zion through the rising of the glory of Jehovah; the second (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-4.htm">Isaiah 60:4-9</a>) her glorification through the recovery of her scattered children, and the gifts of the Gentiles who bring them home; and now the third depicts her glorification through the service of the nations, especially of her former persecutors, and generally through the service of all that is great and glorious in the world of nature and the world of men. Not only do the converted heathen offer their possessions to the church on Zion, but they offer up themselves and their kings to pay her homage and render service to her. "And sons of strangers build thy walls, and their kings serve thee: for in my wrath I have smitten thee, and in my favour I have had mercy upon thee. And thy gates remain open continually day and night, they shall not be shut, to bring in to thee the possessions of the nations and their kings in triumph. For the nation and the kingdom which will not serve thee will perish, and the nations be certainly laid waste." The walls of Zion (&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; doubly defective) rise up from their ruins through the willing co-operation of converted foreigners (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-6.htm">Isaiah 56:6-7</a>), and foreign kings place themselves at the service of Zion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-23.htm">Isaiah 49:23</a>); the help rendered by the edicts of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes Longimanus being only a prelude to events stretching on to the end of time, though indeed, in the view of the prophet himself, the period immediately succeeding the captivity really would be the end of time. Of the two perfects in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-10.htm">Isaiah 60:10</a>, &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; points to the more remote past; &#1512;&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1498; to the nearer past, stretching forward into the present (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-8.htm">Isaiah 54:8</a>). On pitte&#772;a&#774;ch, patescere, hiscere, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-8.htm">Isaiah 48:8</a>, where it is applied to the ear, as in Sol 7:13 to a bud. The first clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-11.htm">Isaiah 60:11</a> closes with &#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;; tiphchah divides more strongly than tebir, which is subordinate to it. At the same time, "day and night" may be connected with "shall not be shut," as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-25.htm">Revelation 21:25-26</a>. The gates of Zion may always be left open, for there is no more fear of a hostile attack; and they must be left open ad importandum, that men may bring in the possession of the heathen through them (a thing which goes on uninterruptedly), &#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;. The last words are rendered by Knobel, "and their kings are leaders (of the procession);" but na&#770;hu&#772;g would be a strange substantive, having nothing to support it but the obscure &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513; from &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, for &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; in Sol 3:8 does not mean a support, but amplexus (Ewald, 149, d). The rendering "and their kings escorted," i.e., attended by an escort, commends itself more than this; but in the passage quoted in support of this use of na&#770;hag, viz., <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/2-8.htm">Nahum 2:8</a>, it is used as a synonym of ha&#770;ga&#770;h, signifying gemere. It is better to follow the lxx and Jerome, and render it, "and their kings brought," viz., according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-4.htm">Isaiah 20:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-2.htm">1 Samuel 30:2</a>, as prisoners (Targ. zeq&#305;&#772;q&#305;&#772;n, i.e., beziqq&#305;&#772;m, in fetters) - brought, however, not by their several nations who are tired of their government and deliver them up (as Hitzig supposes), but by the church, by which they have been irresistibly bound in fetters, i.e., inwardly conquered (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/149-8.htm">Psalm 149:8</a>), and thus suffer themselves to be brought in a triumphal procession to the holy city as the captives of the church and her God. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-12.htm">Isaiah 60:12</a> is connected with this nehu&#772;g&#305;&#772;m; for the state of every nation and kingdom is henceforth to be determined by its subjection to the church of the God of sacred history (&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;, &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, in distinction from she&#772;re&#772;th, &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;), and by its entrance into this church - the very same thought which Zechariah carries out in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-16.htm">Isaiah 14:16</a>. Instead of &#1499;&#1497;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1493;&#1497;, &#1499;&#1497; is more properly pointed according to certain MSS with munach (without makkeph); the article before haggo&#772;yim is remonstrative, and the inf. intens. cha&#770;ro&#772;bh makes the thing threatened unquestionable. </body></html>
