The nations and their kings shall lay themselves out for the good of the church. Such a salvation, such a redemption, shall be wrought out for thee, as discovers itself to be the work of the Lord. Every thing shall be changed for the better. In thy land shall no more be heard threats of those that do violence, nor complaints of those that suffer violence. Thy walls shall be means of safety, thy gates shall be written upon with praises to God. In the close of this chapter are images and expressions used in the description of the New Jerusalem, Re 21:23; 22:5. Nothing can answer to this but some future glorious state of the church on earth, or the state of the church triumphant in heaven. Those that make God their only light, shall have him their all-sufficient light. And the happiness shall know no change or alloy. No people on earth are all righteous; but there are no mixtures in heaven. They shall be wholly righteous. The spirits of just men shall there be made perfect. The glory of the church shall be to the honour of God. When it shall be finished, it will appear a work of wonder. It may seem too difficult to be brought about, but the God of almighty power has undertaken it. It may seem to be delayed and put off; but the Lord will hasten it in the time appointed by his wisdom, though not in the time prescribed by our folly. Let this hope cheer us under all difficulties, and stir us up to all diligence, that we may have an abundant entrance into this everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/60.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy sun shall no more go down - There shall be no total and long night of calamity, error, and sin. This is designed to describe the flourishing and glorious state of the church. It, of course, does not mean that there should be no times of calamity, no period of ignorance, no scenes of persecution; but it means that there should not be total night. Truth should reign on the earth, and there never would be a time when the light of salvation would be extinct. There never would be a time like that when Jerusalem was wholly destroyed, and a long total night came over the land. There never would be a time when the Sun of righteousness would not shine, or when the world would be wholly deprived of the illumination of his beams. The church would be perpetual. It would live through all changes, and survive all revolutions, and to the end of time the light of salvation would shine upon a darkened world. Since the Messiah came the light of revelation has never been wholly withdrawn from the world, nor has there been a period in which total and absolute night has come over all the church of God. But the prophet, probably, referred to far more glorious times than have yet occurred. The period is coming when the light of salvation will shine upon the earth with unclouded and universal splendor, as if the sun having ascended to the meridian should stand there in a blaze of glory age after age; when there shall be no alternation of day and night when the light shall not be obscured by clouds; and when there shall be no eclipse of his glory.<p>Neither shall thy moon - This language is poetic, and means that there would be no such obscurity in the church as there would be in the world should the sun and moon be withdrawn. Light and beauty unobscured would fill the whole heavens, and the darkness of night would be henceforward unknown.<p>Withdraw itself - Hebrew, &#1497;&#1488;&#1505;&#1507;  ye&#772;'a&#770;se&#772;p - 'Be collected,' that is, shall not be withdrawn, or shall not wane. The Septuagint, &#x39f;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  Ouk ekleipsei - 'Shall not be eclipsed,' or shall not fail.<p>The days of thy mourning - (See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>). The description here, therefore, is one of great glory and happiness in the church. That period will yet arrive; and no friend of God and of the happiness of man can think of that time without praying most sincerely that it may soon come, when the Sun of righteousness, in the fullness of his glory, shall ascend to the meridian, and stand there without one obscuring cloud, and pour the splendor of the noontide beams all over a darkened world. Some of the ideas in this chapter, descriptive of the glorious times of the gospel, have been beautifully versified by Pope in his Messiah:<p>Rise, crown'd with light, imperial Salem, rise!<p>Exalt thy tow'ry head, and lift thy eyes!<p>See a long race thy spacious courts adorn;<p>See future sons and daughters yet unborn,<p>In crowding ranks on every side arise,<p>Demanding life, impatient for the skies!<p>See barbarous nations at thy gates attend,<p>Walk in thy light, and in thy temple bend:<p>See thy bright altars throng'd with prostrate kings,<p>And heap'd with products of Sabcan springs!<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/60.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20.

This is a different sun from the former; this is the church's sun, and no other than the sun of righteousness, Christ Jesus; who has his risings and settings now, at least, in the apprehensions of his people; he sometimes withdraws himself, and is gone; and then returns again: but so it will not be in this state: the saints shall be for ever with him, and he shall be for ever with them; who will always behold his glory, and be enlightened by him; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>, <p>neither shall thy moon withdraw itself; or, "shall not be gathered" (i), under a cloud; or "fail" (k), as the Septuagint version; or, "suffer a defect", as the Arabic version; as the moon does when in the wane, or is eclipsed. This may refer to this then present state of the church, which shall not fail; and to the blessings and comforts of it from Christ the sun, which will not cease, the enjoyment of them be ever interrupted. The Targum is, <p>"thy kingdom shall cease no more, and thy glory shall not be removed;'' <p>and so Maimonides (l) interprets it of the kingdom of the Messiah, that shall endure for ever: <p>for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light; this is repeated for the confirmation of it: <p>and the days of thy mourning shall be ended (m); or, "completed"; shall be fully up, and so at an end: or, "shall be recompensed" (n); with an everlasting day of joy and pleasure; there will now be no more sin to distress the saints; no more temptations of Satan to annoy them; no more afflictions either of body or mind to trouble them; no more pain, or crying, or death; and so no more mourning; sorrow and sighing will flee away; all tears will be wiped from their eyes; and everlasting joy be upon their heads; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>. <p>(i) "non colligetur", Montanus, Vitringa; "vel recolligetur", Vatablus; "occultabitur", Munster, Tigurine version.

Till the new Jerusalem descends from heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>), and Christ reigns personally over his people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a>), the Church is always, more or less, in a state of mourning. The Bridegroom is away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>); his light shines upon his Church only by snatches; his Church feels itself unworthy of him - cold, unloving, stained with sin. Fasting, weeping, and mourning befit such a state of things. But in the final condition of the redeemed their mourning shall be ended, "sorrow and sighing shall have fled away" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>); God shall have "wiped away all tears from their eyes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>); "There shall be no more death" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>); "no more curse" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-3.htm">Revelation 22:3</a>); "neither sorrow, nor crying; neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).

"The children also of thy tormentors come bending unto thee, and all thy despisers stretch themselves at the soles of thy feet, and call thee 'City of Jehovah, Zion of the Holy One of Israel.'" The persecutors of the church both in work and word are now no more (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-14.htm">Isaiah 26:14</a>), and their children fell themselves disarmed. They are seized with shame and repentance, when they see the church which was formerly tormented and despised so highly exalted. They come shecho&#772;a&#774;ch (an inf. noun of the form &#1496;&#1495;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-13.htm">Lamentations 5:13</a>; used here as an accusative of more precise definition, just as nouns of this kind are frequently connected directly with the verb &#1492;&#1500;&#1498;, Ewald, 279, c), literally a bow or stoop, equivalent to bowing or stooping (the opposite to ro&#772;ma&#770;h in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-3.htm">Micah 2:3</a>), and stretch themselves "at the soles of thy feet," i.e., clinging to thee as imploringly and obsequiously as if they would lay themselves down under thy very feet, and were not worthy to lie anywhere but there (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-23.htm">Isaiah 49:23</a>); and whereas formerly they called thee by nicknames, they now give thee the honourable name of "City of Jehovah, Zion of the Holy One of Israel," not "Sanctuary of Israel," as Meier supposes, since qedo&#772;sh Israel is always a name of Jehovah in the book of Isaiah. It is a genitive construction like Bethlehem of Judah, Gibeah of Saul, and others. </body></html>
