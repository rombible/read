Guided by <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-1.htm" title="Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew their strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us come near together to judgment.">Isaiah 41:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/1-4.htm" title="Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger, they are gone away backward.">Isaiah 1:4-9</a>, we recognise here, as there, the utterance of the ideal Servant of Jehovah. That view, it needs scarcely be said, is the one suggested to all Christian minds by our Lord’s application of the passage to His own work in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/4-16.htm" title="And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.">Luke 4:16-22</a>. The opening words repeat what had been said by Jehovah of the Servant in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.">Isaiah 42:1</a>. The “anointing,” as it stands, might be that of king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-16.htm" title="To morrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked on my people, because their cry is come to me.">1Samuel 9:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-1.htm" title="Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD has anointed you to be captain over his inheritance?">1Samuel 10:1</a>), or priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-2.htm" title="And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour shall you make them.">Exodus 29:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-36.htm" title="Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their generations.">Leviticus 7:36</a>), or prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-16.htm" title="And Jehu the son of Nimshi shall you anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shall you anoint to be prophet in your room.">1Kings 19:16</a>). As interpreted by its fulfilment, it may be held to include all three.<p><span class= "bld">To preach good tidings . . .</span>—Comp.

To this passage, more than any other, even than <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-9.htm" title="O Zion, that bring good tidings, get you up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bring good tidings, lift up your voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say to the cities of Judah, Behold your God!">Isaiah 40:9</a>, we may trace the use of the word “gospel” (“evangel,” “good tidings”) in our Lord’s teaching and that of the Apostles. Claiming the promise as fulfilled in Himself, He became the great evangelist, and all who followed Him were called to the same office.<p><span class= "bld">To bind up the broken-hearted . . .</span>—The primary thought is that of a healing bandage applied to the heart’s wounds. (Comp. 1:6), The Servant of Jehovah is the great physician as well as the evangelist.<p><span class= "bld">To proclaim liberty.</span>—Phrase and thought are taken from the law of the Year of Jubilee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-10.htm" title="And you shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee to you; and you shall return every man to his possession, and you shall return every man to his family.">Leviticus 25:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-17.htm" title="But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons' for them.">Ezekiel 46:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-8.htm" title="This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them;">Jeremiah 34:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The opening of the prison.</span>—The LXX., adopted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-18.htm" title="The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,">Luke 4:18</a>, gives “recovery of sight to the blind;” and as the verb is never used for the opening of a room or door, and is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-5.htm" title="Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.">Isaiah 35:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-7.htm" title="To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.">Isaiah 42:7</a>, for the opening of the eyes, that is probably its meaning here.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/61.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-1.htm" title="The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on me; because the LORD has anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;">Isaiah 61:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Spirit of the Lord is upon me </span>— To qualify me for effecting what is foretold and promised in the foregoing chapter. As Christ has applied this passage to himself, (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-16.htm" title="And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.">Luke 4:16</a>,) and assured us that it was fulfilled in him, we may, with the utmost reason, conclude that he is here introduced by the prophet in his own person, and not that the prophet speaks of himself, as some have thought. <span class="ital">Because, </span>or rather, <span class="ital">for, the Lord hath anointed me </span>— Hath commissioned me with authority, qualified me with gifts, and set me apart, for the important offices here mentioned. Prophets, priests, and kings, among the Jews, were usually appointed and set apart to their several offices, as we have repeatedly seen, by anointing them with oil, which ceremony was used by the express command of God, and was intended to show, not only that the persons so anointed were called to, but were, or should be, qualified for, these offices, with suitable gifts and graces. But the anointing of Christ, who was to sustain offices incomparably more important, and productive of infinitely greater effects, was of another nature, he being anointed, not with external and corruptible oil, but with the eternal Spirit of the incorruptible God, which qualified him for every part of the great work to which he was called, beyond all others that were before him. Which Spirit he had without measure, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-34.htm" title="For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God: for God gives not the Spirit by measure to him.">John 3:34</a>; and therefore is said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-7.htm" title="You love righteousness, and hate wickedness: therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.">Psalm 45:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-9.htm" title="You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.">Hebrews 1:9</a>) to be anointed <span class="ital">with the oil of gladness above his fellows. To preach good tidings </span>— Namely, tidings of salvation, of pardoning mercy, of renewing grace, and of eternal glory; <span class="ital">unto the meek </span>— Or, <span class="ital">poor, </span>as the words are rendered by the LXX., whom the evangelists follow <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-18.htm" title="The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,">Luke 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-5.htm" title="The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.">Matthew 11:5</a>; namely, to the penitent, the humble, and <span class="ital">poor in spirit; </span>to whom the tidings of a Redeemer, and of salvation through him, are indeed good tidings, <span class="ital">faithful sayings, and worthy of all acceptation. </span>These, and even the poor, as to worldly circumstances, are best disposed to receive the gospel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-5.htm" title="Listen, my beloved brothers, Has not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them that love him?">James 2:5</a>; and then it is likely to profit them when it is received <span class="ital">with meekness, </span>as it ought to be. This relates to Christ’s prophetic office. <span class="ital">To bind up the broken-hearted </span>— To give relief and comfort to persons burdened and distressed with a sense of the guilt and power of their sins, and of the wrath of God, to which they are obnoxious. It is a metaphor taken from surgeons binding up wounds: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-6.htm" title="From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.">Isaiah 1:6</a>. This relates to Christ’s priestly office, his blood being the true expiation of sin, and the procuring cause of pardon and peace to the guilty. <span class="ital">To proclaim liberty to the captives</span> — Namely, liberty from the dominion and bondage of sin and Satan, of the world and the flesh, and from the slavish, tormenting fear of death and hell. This appertains to his kingly office. And those whom he, who is exalted to be a <span class="ital">prince, </span>as well as a Saviour, <span class="ital">makes free, are free indeed; </span>not only discharged from the miseries of captivity and bondage, but advanced to all the immunities and dignities of citizens. This is the gospel proclamation, and it is like the blowing of the jubilee trumpet, which proclaimed the great year of release, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-9.htm" title="Then shall you cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.">Leviticus 25:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-40.htm" title="But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with you, and shall serve you to the year of jubilee.">Leviticus 25:40</a>; in allusion to which, it is here called <span class="ital">the acceptable year of the Lord; </span>the time in which men should find acceptance with God, which is the origin of their liberties: or, it is called <span class="ital">the year of the Lord, </span>because it publishes his free grace, to his own glory; <span class="ital">and an acceptable year, </span>because it brings glad tidings to us; and what cannot but be very acceptable to those who know the capacities and necessities of their own souls.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/61.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>61:1-3 The prophets had the Holy Spirit of God at times, teaching them what to say, and causing them to say it; but Christ had the Spirit always, without measure, to qualify him, as man, for the work to which he was appointed. The poor are commonly best disposed to receive the gospel, Jas 2:5; and it is only likely to profit us when received with meekness. To such as are poor in spirit, Christ preached good tidings when he said, Blessed are the meek. Christ's satisfaction is accepted. By the dominion of sin in us, we are bound under the power of Satan; but the Son is ready, by his Spirit, to make us free; and then we shall be free indeed. Sin and Satan were to be destroyed; and Christ triumphed over them on his cross. But the children of men, who stand out against these offers, shall be dealt with as enemies. Christ was to be a Comforter, and so he is; he is sent to comfort all who mourn, and who seek to him, and not to the world, for comfort. He will do all this for his people, that they may abound in the fruits of righteousness, as the branches of God's planting. Neither the mercy of God, the atonement of Christ, nor the gospel of grace, profit the self-sufficient and proud. They must be humbled, and led to know their own character and wants, by the Holy Spirit, that they may see and feel their need of the sinner's Friend and Saviour. His doctrine contains glad tidings indeed to those who are humbled before God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/61.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Spirit of the Lord God - Hebrew, The Spirit of the Lord Yahweh.' The Chaldee renders this, 'The prophet said, the spirit of prophecy from the presence of Yahweh God is upon me.' The Syriac, 'The Spirit of the Lord God.' The Septuagint, &#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  Pneuma Kuriou - 'The Spirit of the Lord,' omitting the word &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;  'a&#774;dona&#772;y. So Luke quotes it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>. That this refers to the Messiah is abundantly proved by the fact that the Lord Jesus expressly applied it to himself (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-21.htm">Luke 4:21</a>). Rosenmuller, Gesenius, and some others, suppose that it refers to Isaiah himself, and that the idea is, that the prophet proclaims his commission as authorized to administer consolation to the suffering exiles in Babylon. It cannot be denied that the language is such as may be applied in a subordinate sense to the office of the prophet, and that the work of the Redeemer is here described in terms derived from the consolation and deliverance afforded to the long-suffering exiles. But in a much higher sense it refers to the Messiah, and received an entire completion only as applied to him and to his work. Even Grotius, who has been said to 'find Christ nowhere in the Old Testament,' remarks, 'Isaiah here speaks of himself, as the Chaldee observes; but in him we see not an obscure image of Christ.' Applied to the Redeemer, it refers to the time when, having been baptized and set apart to the work of the Mediatorial office, he began publicly to preach (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-21.htm">Luke 4:21</a>). The phrase 'the Spirit of Yahweh is upon me,' refers to the fact; that he had been publicly consecrated to his work by the Holy Spirit descending on him at Iris baptism <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32</a>, and that the Spirit of God had been imparted to him 'without measure' to endow him for his great office (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-34.htm">John 3:34</a>; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>).<p>Because the Lord hath anointed me - The word rendered 'hath anointed' (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;  ma&#770;shach), is that from which the word Messiah is derived (see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>). prophets and kings were set apart to their high office, by the ceremony of pouring oil on their heads; and the idea here is that God had set apart the Messiah for the office which he was to bear, and had abundantly endowed him with the graces of which the anointing oil was an emblem. The same language is used in reference to the Messiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7</a> (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-9.htm">Hebrews 1:9</a>).<p>To preach good tidings - On the meaning of the word (&#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;  ba&#770;s'ar) rendered here 'to preach good tidings,' see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>. The Septuagint renders it, &#x395;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  Euangelisasthai - 'To evangelize,' to preach the gospel.<p>Unto the meek - The word rendered 'meek' (&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;  &#8219;a&#774;na&#770;viym) properly denotes the afflicted, the distressed, the needy. The word 'meek' means those who are patient in the reception of injuries, and stands opposed to revengeful and irascible. This is by no means the sense of the word here. It refers to those who were borne down by calamity in any form, and would be particularly applicable to those who had been sighing in a long captivity in Babylon. It is not improperly rendered by the Septuagint by the word &#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;  pto&#772;chois, 'poor,' and in like manner by Luke Luk 4:18; and the idea is, that the Redeemer came to bring a joyful message to those who were oppressed and borne down by the evils of poverty and calamity (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-5.htm">Matthew 11:5</a>).<p>To bind up the broken-hearted - (See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a>). The broken-hearted are those who are deeply afflicted and distressed on any account. It may be either on account of their sins, or of captivity and oppressionk, or of the loss of relations and friends. The Redeemer came that he might apply the balm of consolation to all such hearts, and give them joy and peace. A similar form of expression occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-3.htm">Psalm 147:3</a> :<p>He healeth the broken in heart,<p>And bindeth up their wounds.<p>To proclaim liberty to the captives - This evidently is language which is taken from the condition of the exiles in their long captivity in Babylon. The Messiah would accomplish a deliverance for those who were held under the captivity of sin similar to that of releasing captives from long and painful servitude. The gospel does not at once, and by a mere exertion of power, open prison doors, and restore captives to liberty. But it accomplishes an effect analogous to this: it releases the mind captive under sin; and it will finally open all prison doors, and by preventing crime will prevent the necessity of prisons, and will remove all the sufferings which are now endured in confinement as the consequence of crime. It may be remarked further, that the word here rendered 'liberty' (&#1491;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512;  dero&#770;r) is a word which is properly applicable to the year of Jubilee, when all were permitred to go free <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a> : 'And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty (&#1491;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512;  dero&#770;r) throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof.' So in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-8.htm">Jeremiah 34:8-9</a>, it is used to denote the manumission of slaves: 'To proclaim liberty (&#1491;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512;  dero&#770;r) unto them; that every man should let his man-servant and every man his maid-servant, being an Hebrew, or an Hebrewess, go free.' So also <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, of the same chapter.<p>So also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-17.htm">Ezekiel 46:17</a>, it is applied to the year in which the slave was by law restored to liberty. Properly, therefore, the word has reference to the freedom of those who are held in bondage, or to servitude; and it may be implied that it was to be a part of the purpose of the Messiah to proclaim, ultimately, universal freedom, and to restore all people to their just rights. If this is the sense - and I see no reason to doubt it - while the main thing intended was that he should deliver people from the inglorious servitude of sin, it also means, that the gospel would contain principles inconsistent with the existence of slavery, and would ultimately produce universal emancipation. Accordingly it is a matter of undoubted fact that its influence was such that in less than three centuries it was the means of abolishing slavery throughout the Roman empire; and no candid reader of the New Testament can doubt that if the principles of Christianity were universally followed, the last shackle would soon fall from the slave. Be the following facts remembered:<p>1. No man ever made another originally a slave under the influence of Christian principle. No man ever kidnapped another, or sold another, BECAUSE it was done in obedience to the laws of Christ.<p>2. No Christian ever manumitted a slave who did not feel that in doing it he was obeying the spirit of Christianity, and who did not have a more quiet conscience on that account.<p>3. No man doubts that if freedom were to prevail everywhere, and all men were to be regarded as of equal civil rights, it would be in accordance with the mind of the Redeemer.<p>4. Slaves are made in violation of all the precepts of the Saviour. The work of kidnapping and selling men, women, and children; of tearing them from their homes, and confining them in the pestilential holds of ships on the ocean, and of dooming them to hard and perpetual servitude, is not the work to which the Lord Jesus calls his disciples.<p>5. Slavery, in fact, cannot be maintained without an incessant violation of the principles of the New Testament. To keep people in ignorance; to witchold from them the Bible; to prevent their learning to read; to render nugatory the marriage contract, or to make it subject to the will of a master; to deprive a man of the avails of Iris own labor without his consent; to make him or his family subject to a removal against his will; to prevent parents from training up their children according to their own views of what is right; to fetter and bind the intellect and shut up the avenues to knowledge as a necessary means of continuing the system; and to make people dependent wholly on others whether they shall hear the gospel or be permitted publicly to embrace it, is everywhere deemed essential to the existence of slavery, and is demanded by all the laws which rule over the regions of a country cursed with this institution. In the whole work of slavery, from the first capture of the unoffending person who is made a slave to the last act which is adopted to secure his bondage, there is an incessant and unvarying trampling on the laws of Jesus Christ. Not one thing is done to make and keep a slave in accordance with any command of Christ; not one thing which would be done if his example were followed and his law obeyed. Who then can doubt that he came ultimately to proclaim freedom to all captives, and that the prevalence of his gospel will yet be the means of universal emancipation?

Language drawn from the deliverance of the Babylonian captives, to describe the deliverance from sin and death (Heb 2:15); also from the "liberty proclaimed" to all bond-servants in the year of jubilee (Isa 61:2; Le 25:10; Jer 34:8, 9).<p>opening of the prison&#8212;The Hebrew rather is, "the most complete opening," namely, of the eyes to them that are bound, that is, deliverance from prison, for captives are as it were blind in the darkness of prison (Isa 14:17; 35:5; 42:7) [Ewald]. So Lu 4:18 and the Septuagint interpret it; Lu 4:18, under inspiration, adds to this, for the fuller explanation of the single clause in the Hebrew, "to set at liberty them that are bruised"; thus expressing the double "opening" implied; namely, that of the eyes (Joh 9:39), and that of the prison (Ro 6:18; 7:24, 25; Heb 2:15).

According to the Targum, these are the words of the prophet concerning himself; and so say Aben Ezra and Kimchi; but the latter elsewhere says (p) they are the words of the Messiah, who should say, "because the Lord hath anointed me", &amp;c.; and another of their writers (q) is in a doubt about them; either, says he, they are the words of the prophet with respect to the Messiah, or the words of the prophet concerning himself; but there is no doubt but the Messiah himself is the person speaking, as appears from <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/4-17.htm">Luke 4:17</a>, on whom the Spirit of God was; not his grace and gifts only, but the person of the Spirit, the third Person in the Trinity, equal with the Father and the Son; to whom several divine actions are ascribed, and to whom many things relating to Christ are attributed, and who is described as residing on him, and who, by the baptist, was seen upon him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a> the phrase denotes his continuance with him, whereby he was qualified, as man and Mediator, for his office: <p>because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek: not the Lord, the Spirit that was upon him, for Christ was anointed with the Holy Ghost; but Jehovah the, Father, he was the anointer of Christ, by whom he was anointed in some sense from everlasting, being invested by him with the office of Mediator, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-21.htm">Proverbs 8:21</a> and in the fulness of time, in the human nature, at his birth and baptism, with the Holy Spirit, his gifts and grace, without measure, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7</a>, hence he has the name of Messiah or Anointed, and from him his people have the anointing which teacheth all things: and hereby he was qualified, as a prophet, to preach good tidings to the meek; such as are sensible of sin, and humbled for it; submit to the righteousness of Christ; ascribe all they have to the grace of God and have a mean opinion of themselves, and patiently bear every affliction: or "poor", as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>, the poor of this world, and as to their intellectuals, and spirit, who are sensible of their spiritual poverty, and seek the true riches, to these the Gospel is "good tidings"; and to such Christ preached good tidings concerning, the love, grace, and mercy of God; concerning peace, pardon, righteousness, life and salvation, by himself; concerning the kingdom of God, and the things appertaining to it: <p>he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted; whose hearts are smitten and made contrite by the Spirit and Word of God, and are truly humbled under a sense of sin; who are cut to the heart, have wounded spirits, and in great pain; these Christ binds up, by speaking comfortably to them; by applying his blood; by discovering the free and full pardon of their sins; and for this, as Mediator, he had a mission and commission from his Father; he came not of himself, but he sent him: <p>to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening, of the prison to them that are bound; to such who were captives to sin, Satan, and the law, and as it were prisoners to them, shut up by them, and in them, and held fast there; but Christ, as he is the author of liberty; obtains it for his people, and makes them free with it, so he proclaims it in the Gospel; a liberty from sin, from the damning and governing power of it; a freedom from the curse and condemnation of the law; a deliverance from Satan, as of a prey from the mighty, or as of prisoners from the prison house.

It is simply astonishing that some Christian commentators (Ewald, Hitzig, Knobel) have not seen the force of this argument, but, with the Jews, imagine the prophet to be speaking of his own ministry. It is contrary to the entire spirit of Isaiah's writings so to glorify himself, and specially unsuitable that, after having brought forward with such emphasis the Person of "the Servant" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-1.htm">Isaiah 49:1-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1-12</a>), he should proceed to take his place, and to "ascribe to himself those very same official attributes which he has already set forth as characteristic features in his portrait of the predicted One" (Delitzsch).

"For copper I bring gold, and for iron I bring silver, and for wood copper, and for stones iron, and make peace thy magistracy, and righteousness thy bailiffs. Injustice is no more seen in thy land, wasting and destruction in thy borders; and thou callest salvation thy walls, and renown thy gates." Wood and stone are not used at all in the building of the new Jerusalem. Just as in the time of Solomon silver was counted as nothing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21</a>) and had only the value of stones (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-27.htm">1 Kings 10:27</a>), so here Jehovah gives her gold instead of copper, silver instead of iron; whilst copper and iron are so despised with this superabundance of the precious metals, that they take the place of such building materials as wood and stones. Thus the city will be a massive one, and not even all of stone, but entirely built of metal, and indestructible not only by the elements, but by all kinds of foes. The allegorical continuation of the prophecy shows very clearly that the prophet does not mean his words to be taken literally. The lxx, Saad., and others, are wrong in adopting the rendering, "I make thy magistracy peace," etc.; since sha&#770;lo&#772;m and tseda&#770;qa&#770;h are not accusatives of either the predicate or the object, but such personifications as we are accustomed to in Isaiah (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-16.htm">Isaiah 32:16-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-14.htm">Isaiah 59:14</a>; cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-8.htm">Isaiah 45:8</a>). Jehovah makes peace its pequdda&#770;h, i.e., its "overseership" (like gebhu&#772;ra&#770;h, heroship, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-25.htm">Isaiah 3:25</a>, and &#8219;ezra&#770;h, helpership, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-2.htm">Isaiah 31:2</a>), or magistracy; and righteousness its bailiffs. The plural &#1504;&#1490;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1498; is no disproof of the personification; the meaning is, that tseda&#770;qa&#770;h (righteousness) is to Jerusalem what the whole body of civil officers together are: that is to say, righteousness is a substitute for the police force in every form. Under such magistracy and such police, nothing is ever heard within the land, of which Jerusalem is the capital, of either cha&#770;ma&#770;s, i.e., a rude and unjust attack of the stronger upon the weaker, or of sho&#772;d, i.e., conquest and devastation, and shebher, i.e., dashing to pieces, or breaking in two. It has walls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-10.htm">Isaiah 60:10</a>); but in truth "salvation," the salvation of its God, is regarded as its impregnable fortifications. It has gates (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-11.htm">Isaiah 60:11</a>) but tehilla&#770;h, the renown that commands respect, with which Jehovah has invested it, is really better than any gate, whether for ornament or protection. </body></html>
