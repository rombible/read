Whether (1) Isaiah borrowed from Micah, or (2) Micah from Isaiah, or (3) both from some earlier prophet, or (4) whether each received an independent yet identical revelation, is a problem which we have no adequate data for solving. Micah prophesied, like Isaiah, under Ahaz, Jotham, and Hezekiah, and so either may have heard it from the other. On the other hand, the prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem, on which these verses follow, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-12.htm" title="Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.">Micah 3:12</a>, appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-18.htm" title="Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus said the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.">Jeremiah 26:18</a> to have been spoken in the days of Hezekiah.

Zion, with the Temple, was to be no longer surrounded by hills as high as, or higher than, itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-2.htm" title="As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from now on even for ever.">Psalm 125:2</a>), scorned by other mountains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/68-16.htm" title="Why leap you, you high hills? this is the hill which God desires to dwell in; yes, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.">Psalm 68:16-17</a>); but was to be to Israel as a Sinai or a Lebanon, as a Mount Meru, or an Olympus, “an exceeding high mountain” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-2.htm" title="In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me on a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south.">Ezekiel 40:2</a>), whose physical elevation should answer to its spiritual. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm" title="All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel to the king's winepresses.">Zechariah 14:10</a>.) So in that vision of the future, the waters of Shiloah, that went softly, were to become a broad and rushing river (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-21.htm" title="But there the glorious LORD will be to us a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.">Isaiah 33:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/47-3.htm" title="And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters were to the ankles.">Ezekiel 47:3-12</a>). So, when men had been taught by experience that this ideal was to be realised in no Jerusalem or earth, the seer of Patmos saw a yet more transcendent vision of the glories of the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-10.htm" title="And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,">Revelation 21:10</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-5.htm" title="And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God gives them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 22:5</a>), and yet even these were but types and figures of divine and ineffable realities.<p><span class= "bld">All nations shall flow unto it.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">all the nations</span>—i.e., the heathen as distinct from Israel. The prophet sees and welcomes the approach of pilgrims from all regions of the earth to the new sanctuary. Thus early in his work was Isaiah (half unconsciously as to the manner in which his vision was to be realised) the prophet of a universal religion, of which the truths of Judaism were the centre, and of a catholic Church. In the admission of proselytes, commemorated in Psalms 87 (probably written about this time), we may see what may either have suggested the prophecy, or have seemed as the first-fruits of its fulfilment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.">Isaiah 2:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">And </span>— Or rather, <span class="ital">now, it shall come to pass in the last days </span>— The times of the Messiah, which are always spoken of by the prophets as <span class="ital">the last days, </span>because they are the last times and state of the church, Christ’s institutions being to continue to the end of the world.

The Jews, it must be observed, divided the times or succession of the world into three ages or periods: the first, before the law; the second, under the law; the third, under the Messiah: which they justly considered as the last dispensation, designed of God to remain till the consummation of all things. “Accordingly St. Paul tells us, that Christ appeared <span class="greekheb">επι συντελεια των αιωνων</span>, <span class="ital">at the consummation of the ages, </span>or several periods of the world, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm" title="For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.">Hebrews 9:26</a>; and, speaking of his own times, saith, <span class="greekheb">τελη των αιωνων</span>, <span class="ital">the ends of the world, </span>or <span class="ital">conclusion of the ages, are come, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-11.htm" title="Now all these things happened to them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the world are come.">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>. <span class="ital">The mountain of the Lord’s house </span>— Mount Moriah, on which the Lord’s house stood, or rather, the Lord’s house upon that mount, <span class="ital">shall be established upon the top of the mountains </span>— Shall be raised above, be rendered more conspicuous than, and shall be preferred before, all other mountains on which houses are built, and altars erected and dedicated to any god or gods. The prophet speaks figuratively. He means, that the worship of the true God should be established on the ruins of idolatry, that the true religion should swallow up all false religions, and the church of God, typified by the temple at Jerusalem, become most eminent and conspicuous, as a city on a high mountain: <span class="ital">and shall be exalted above the hills </span>— Above all churches, states, and kingdoms in the world, and all that is excellent and glorious therein. <span class="ital">The stone cut out of the mountain, without hands, shall become itself a mountain, and shall fill the whole earth, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/2-34.htm" title="You saw till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image on his feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces....">Daniel 2:34-35</a>. <span class="ital">And all nations </span>— Even the Gentile nations; <span class="ital">shall flow unto it </span>— Shall come in great abundance and with great eagerness to embrace the true religion, and become members of the true church, like broad streams, or mighty rivers, flowing swiftly and impetuously toward the ocean, as the word <span class="greekheb">נהרי</span>, here used, signifies. Now, it is well known, this was not the case with respect to the Jewish Church at Jerusalem, or the worship there established. It never happened, during the ages that intervened between the time of Isaiah and the destruction of their city and temple, and the dispersion of their nation by the Romans, that their religion was so exalted, or made such great account of, by any nations remote or near, as is here expressed: much less did whole nations flow unto them, or unite themselves with them in the service of God, and in church fellowship. But this prophecy has been in a great measure fulfilled with regard to the Christian Church, which has so drawn to it the greater part of the civilized nations, that it has far, very far, surpassed all other religious institutions, whether Jewish, heathen, or Mohammedan: and when the last of the four kingdoms, spoken of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-35.htm" title="Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.">Daniel 2:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/2-40.htm" title="And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: for as much as iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things: and as iron that breaks all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise....">Daniel 2:40-45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/7-19.htm" title="Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;...">Daniel 7:19-27</a>, shall be destroyed, and thereby all obstructions removed, it shall be fully and perfectly accomplished, and the <span class="ital">kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the Most High. </span>For the Messiah <span class="ital">shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the</span> <span class="ital">river to the ends of the earth: yea, all kings shall fall down before him, and all nations shall serve him, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-8.htm" title="He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.">Psalm 72:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-11.htm" title="Yes, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.">Psalm 72:11</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 The calling of the Gentiles, the spread of the gospel, and that far more extensive preaching of it yet to come, are foretold. Let Christians strengthen one another, and support one another. It is God who teaches his people, by his word and Spirit. Christ promotes peace, as well as holiness. If all men were real Christians, there could be no war; but nothing answering to these expressions has yet taken place on the earth. Whatever others do, let us walk in the light of this peace. Let us remember that when true religion flourishes, men delight in going up to the house of the Lord, and in urging others to accompany them. Those are in danger who please themselves with strangers to God; for we soon learn to follow the ways of persons whose company we keep. It is not having silver and gold, horses and chariots, that displeases God, but depending upon them, as if we could not be safe, and easy, and happy without them, and could not but be so with them. Sin is a disgrace to the poorest and the lowest. And though lands called Christian are not full of idols, in the literal sense, are they not full of idolized riches? and are not men so busy about their gains and indulgences, that the Lord, his truths, and precepts, are forgotten or despised?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the last days - &#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;  be'acha&#774;r&#305;&#770;yth ha&#772;ya&#770;m&#305;&#770;ym. In the "after" days; in the "futurity" of days; that is, in the time to come. This is an expression that often occurs in the Old Testament. It does not of itself refer to any "particular" period, and especially not, as our translation would seem to indicate, to the end of the world. The expression properly denotes "only future time" in general. But the prophets were accustomed to concentrate all their hopes on the coming of the Messiah. They saw his advent as giving character, and sublimity, and happiness to all coming times. Hence, the expression came to denote, by way of eminence, the times of the Messiah, and is frequently used in the New Testament, as well as the Old, to designate those times; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-5.htm">1 Peter 1:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-1.htm">Genesis 49:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-30.htm">Deuteronomy 4:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-47.htm">Jeremiah 48:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-28.htm">Daniel 11:28</a>.<p>The expressions which follow are figurative, and cannot well be interpreted as relating to any other events than the times of the Messiah. They refer to that future period, then remote, which would constitute the "last" dispensation of things in this world - the "last" time - the period, however long it might be, in which the affairs of the world would be closed. The patriarchal times had passed away; the dispensation under the Mosaic economy would pass away; the times of the Messiah would be the "last" times, or the last dispensation, under which the affairs of the world would be consummated. Thus the phrase is evidently used in the New Testament, as denoting the "last" time, though without implying that that time would be short. It might be longer than "all" the previous periods put together, but it would be the "last" economy, and under that economy, or "in" that time, the world would be destroyed, Christ would come to judgment, the dead would be raised, and the affairs of the world would be wound up. The apostles, by the use of this phrase, never intimate that the time would be short, or that the day of judgment was near, but only that "in" that time the great events of the world's history would be consummated and closed; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:1-5</a>. This prophecy occurs in Micah M<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1-5</a> with scarcely any variation. It is not known whether Isaiah made use of Micah, or Micah of Isaiah, or both of an older and well-known prophecy. Hengstenberg ("Chris." i., pp. 289, 290) supposes that Isaiah copied from Micah, and suggests the following reasons:<p>1. The prediction of Isaiah is disconnected with what goes before, and yet begins with the copulative &#1493;  (v), "and." In Micah, on the contrary, it is connected with what precedes and follows.<p>2. In the discourses of the prophets, the promise usually follows the threatening. This order is observed by Micah; in Isaiah, on the contrary, the promise contained in the passage precedes the threatening, and another promise follows. Many of the older theologians supposed that the passages were communicated alike by the Holy Spirit to both writers. But there is no improbability in supposing that Isaiah may have availed himself of language used by Micah in describing the same event.<p>The mountain of the Lord's house - The temple was built on mount Moriah, which was hence called the mountain of the Lord's house. The temple, or the mountain on which it was reared, would be the object which would express the public worship of the true God. And hence, to say that that should be elevated higher than all other hills, or mountains, means, that the worship of the true God would become an object so conspicuous as to be seen by all nations; and so conspicuous that all nations would forsake other objects and places of worship, being attracted by the glory of the worship of the true God.<p>Shall be established - Shall be fixed, rendered permanent.<p>In the top of the mountains - To be in the top of the mountains, would be to be "conspicuous," or seen from afar. In other words, the true religion would be made known to all people.<p>Shall flow unto it - This is a figurative expression, denoting that they would be converted to the true religion. It indicates that they would come in multitudes, like the flowing of a mighty river. The idea of the "flowing" of the nations, or of the movement of many people toward an object like a broad stream, is one that is very grand and sublime; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-7.htm">Psalm 65:7</a>. This cannot be understood of any period previous to the establishment of the gospel. At no time of the Jewish history did any events occur that would be a complete fulfillment of this prophecy. The expressions evidently refer to that period elsewhere often predicted by this prophet <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-22.htm">Isaiah 49:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-3.htm">Isaiah 54:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-10.htm">Isaiah 60:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-2.htm">Isaiah 62:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-12.htm">Isaiah 66:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-19.htm">Isaiah 66:19</a>, when "the Gentiles" would be brought to the knowledge of the true religion. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-12.htm">Isaiah 66:12</a>, there occurs a passage remarkably similar, and which may serve to explain this:<p>'Behold I will extend peace to her (to Zion) as a river;<p>And the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream.'<p>Under the Messiah, through the preaching of the apostles and by the spread of the gospel, this prophecy was to receive its full accomplishment. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

The days of the Messiah commenced in the latter part of the Old Testament dispensation, or Jewish world, towards the close of their civil and church state, at the end of which he was to come, <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a> and accordingly did, which is called the end of the world, and the last days; that is, of that state, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a> and ushered in the world to come, or Gospel dispensation, which is properly the days of the Messiah, reaching from his first to his second coming; the first of which were the times of John the Baptist, Christ and his apostles; the latter days of that dispensation take in the rise and reign of antichrist, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm">1 Timothy 4:1</a> the last days of it are those which bring in the perilous times, the spiritual reign of Christ, and the destruction of antichrist, and which will precede the personal coming of Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-1.htm">2 Timothy 3:1</a> and these are the days here referred to. <p>That the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains; by "the mountain" of the Lord's house is meant, not Mount Moriah, on which the temple was built, as Kimchi interprets it; nor the temple itself, as the Targum; though in the last days of it, and at the first coming of the Messiah, that had a greater glory than ever it had before, through the personal presence of Christ in it; through the effusion of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles there, on the day of Pentecost; and through the Gospel being first preached here by Christ and his apostles, from whence it went forth into all the world, as is afterwards predicted it should; but the kingdom of Christ, which is his church, is here designed; called "the Lord's house", because of his building, and where he dwells, and which he will at this time beautify and glorify; the materials of it are lively stones, or true believers; laid on Christ the foundation, into which there is no right entrance but through faith in him, who is the door, and where is plenty of provisions; the pillars and beams of it are the ministers of the Gospel, and its windows are the ordinances: here Christ is as a Son over his own house; he is the Master of it, the High Priest and Prophet in it; and his servants are the stewards of it, to give to everyone their portion; and happy are they that have a name and a place in it: and it is called "the mountain", in allusion to Mount Zion, on which the temple stood; because of its immovableness, being secured in the everlasting and electing love of God, and in the unalterable covenant of grace, founded on the Rock Christ, and guarded by the mighty power of God. This is "established in the top of the mountains"; in Christ, who is higher than the kings of the earth, signified by mountains, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-9.htm">Revelation 17:9</a> who is the Head of all principality and power; not in their first head, or in themselves, is the establishment of the saints, but in Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-21.htm">2 Corinthians 1:21</a> he is the stability of their persons, of their grace, and of their life, spiritual and eternal. Here it seems to denote the superiority of the kingdom and interest of Christ to all civil and religious states; the settlement and security of it; its standing above them, and continuance when they shall be no more, even all antichristian states, both Papal, Pagan, and Mahometan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>. <p>and shall be exalted above the hills; Mount Zion is above Mount Sinai, or the Gospel dispensation is preferable to the legal one. It is an observation of Jarchi, that it shall be exalted by a greater sign or miracle that shall be done in it than was done in Sinai, Carmel, and Tabor; the law was given on Sinai, and many wonders wrought; but on Zion the Messiah himself appeared, and his Gospel was published, and miracles wrought by him. And in the latter day, when Christ, and he alone, shall be exalted, as he will at the time this prophecy refers to, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a> the church will be exalted; the glory of the Lord will be risen upon her; the interest of Christ will exceed all other interests; his religion will be the prevailing one; the kingdoms of this world will become his; and his dominion will be from sea to sea, and from the rivers to the end of the earth. This may also denote the visibility of the kingdom and church of Christ; it will be as a city on a hill; and however obscure the church is now, being in the wilderness, it will at this time be visible to all: <p>and all nations shall flow unto it; that is, many out of all nations shall be converted, and come freely and willingly to join themselves to the church of Christ; they shall come in great numbers, in company together, and that continually, like flowing streams; they shall first flow to the Lord, and to his goodness, and then to his church and ordinances; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-4.htm">Isaiah 60:4</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And it <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> shall come to pass in the last days, <i>that</i> the mount of the LORD'S house <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> flow to it.</span><p>(a) The decree and ordinance of God, concerning the restoration of the Church, which is chiefly meant by the time of Christ.<p>(b) In an evident place to be seen and discerned.<p>(c) When the kingdom of Christ will be enlarged by the preaching of the doctrine.

An exact Assyrian parallel to this use (<span class="ital">akhrat yumi</span>) is given by Cheyne and Delitzsch. By the prophets the expression is often specialised in an eschatological sense, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-5.htm" title="Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.">Hosea 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-16.htm" title="And you shall come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring you against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in you, O Gog, before their eyes.">Ezekiel 38:16</a> (cf. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-8.htm" title="Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:">Isaiah 2:8</a></span>), and probably <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-47.htm" title="Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, said the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.">Jeremiah 48:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-39.htm" title="But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring again the captivity of Elam, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 49:39</a>, where it means (as here) the final age of the world’s history following the establishment of the kingdom of God.

The phrase occurs in the parallel passage in Micah, also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-12.htm" title="Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.">Micah 3:12</a> (“mount of the house”); <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/16-20.htm" title="And others he sent to take Jerusalem, and the mountain of the temple.">1Ma 16:20</a> (“mount of the temple”). In the next verse it is resolved into the two members of a parallelism: “mountain of Jehovah” and “house of the God of Jacob.” <span class="ital">established in the top of</span> …] Better as R.V. <span class="bld">at the head of</span> … (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-22.htm" title="And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlor, and made them sit in the most chief place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.">1 Samuel 9:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-7.htm" title="Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.">Amos 6:7</a>); although the translation “as the chief of the mountains” would also be admissible (Davidson, <span class="ital">Synt.</span> § 101 R, 1 a.). A miraculous physical elevation of Zion may possibly be thought of (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-2.htm" title="In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me on a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south.">Ezekiel 40:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm" title="All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel to the king's winepresses.">Zechariah 14:10</a>); but the idea (seriously entertained by some) that Zion is to be literally set on the top of the other hills is too grotesque to be attributed to any prophet, save under compulsion. In this passage a metaphorical exaltation, in respect of political and religious importance, seems to satisfy all the requirements both of syntax and exegesis (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-15.htm" title="The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill of Bashan.">Psalm 68:15</a> f.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all</span> (<span class="bld">the</span>) <span class="ital">nations shall flow</span>] Properly “<span class="ital">shall stream</span>,” a verb only used figuratively of the movement of masses of men to great centres of intercourse like Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-12.htm" title="Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.">Jeremiah 31:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-44.htm" title="And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more to him: yes, the wall of Babylon shall fall.">Jeremiah 51:44</a>). Instead of “all the nations” Micah has (in harmony with <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm" title="And many people shall go and say, Come you, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:3</a></span> f.) simply “peoples,” which probably preserves the original text. The universality of the true religion is in either case implied; and the bare suggestion is perhaps more effective than an explicit assertion would be.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-4.</span> - PROPHECY OF THE LAST DAYS. The resemblance of this prophecy to <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1-3</a> is so close as to necessitate the conclusion either that one of the two prophets copied from the other, or that both copied from an earlier document. The latter view, which is that taken by Rosenm&uuml;ller, Maurer, De Wette, Meier, and Mr. Cheyne, seems preferable.  <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the last days</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in the sequel of the days</span>; but generally used of a remote future (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-1.htm">Genesis 49:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-14.htm">Numbers 24:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-30.htm">Deuteronomy 4:30</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The mountain of the Lord's house</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Church, the true Zion, which is to be the antitype of the existing Zion, and is therefore given its material attributes. Spiritually, it would be a "mountain," as "a city set on a hill," which "could not be hid" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14</a>); and again, as occupying a position from which it would command the whole earth. <span class="cmt_word">In the top of the mountains</span>; rather, <span class="accented">at the head of the mountains</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with pre-eminence over them. The metaphor is drawn from the common physical fact of a high mountain range culminating in a single supreme eminence. So Mount Hermon towers above the rest of the Antilibanus, Demavend over Elburz, Rowandiz over Zagros. The "mountains" above which the true Zion shall tower are the kingdoms, or perhaps the religions, of the earth. <span class="cmt_word">All nations</span>; literally, <span class="accented">all the nations</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "all the nations of the earth" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-11.htm">Psalm 72:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall flow</span>; or, <span class="accented">stream</span>. A constant accession of converts from all quarters is intended. These are represented as continually streaming upward into the holy mountain of God's house. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-27.htm">Isaiah 1:27</a> presents it in a brief and concise form: "Sion will be redeemed through judgment, and her returning ones through righteousness." Mishpat and tzeda&#770;ka&#770;h are used elsewhere for divine gifts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-5.htm">Isaiah 33:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-6.htm">Isaiah 28:6</a>), for such conduct as is pleasing to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-16.htm">Isaiah 32:16</a>), and for royal Messianic virtues (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-3.htm">Isaiah 11:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-5.htm">Isaiah 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1</a>). Here, however, where we are helped by the context, they are to be interpreted according to such parallel passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-4.htm">Isaiah 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-16.htm">Isaiah 5:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-17.htm">Isaiah 28:17</a>, as signifying God's right and righteousness in their primarily judicious self-fulfilment. A judgment, on the part of God the righteous One, would be the means by which Zion itself, so far as it had remained faithful to Jehovah, and those who were converted in the midst of the judgment, would be redeemed - a judgment upon sinners and sin, by which the power that had held in bondage the divine nature of Zion, so far as it still continued to exist, would be broken, and in consequence of which those who turned to Jehovah would be incorporated into His true church. Whilst, therefore, God was revealing Himself in His punitive righteousness; He was working out a righteousness which would be bestowed as a gift of grace upon those who escaped the former. The notion of "righteousness" is now following a New Testament track. In front it has the fire of the law; behind, the love of the gospel. Love is concealed behind the wrath, like the sun behind the thunder-clouds. Zion, so far as it truly is or is becoming Zion, is redeemed, and none but the ungodly are destroyed. But, as is added in the next verse, the latter takes place without mercy. </body></html>
