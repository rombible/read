Let Christians strengthen one another, and support one another. It is God who teaches his people, by his word and Spirit. Christ promotes peace, as well as holiness. If all men were real Christians, there could be no war; but nothing answering to these expressions has yet taken place on the earth. Whatever others do, let us walk in the light of this peace. Let us remember that when true religion flourishes, men delight in going up to the house of the Lord, and in urging others to accompany them. Those are in danger who please themselves with strangers to God; for we soon learn to follow the ways of persons whose company we keep. It is not having silver and gold, horses and chariots, that displeases God, but depending upon them, as if we could not be safe, and easy, and happy without them, and could not but be so with them. Sin is a disgrace to the poorest and the lowest. And though lands called Christian are not full of idols, in the literal sense, are they not full of idolized riches? and are not men so busy about their gains and indulgences, that the Lord, his truths, and precepts, are forgotten or despised?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore - The prophet proceeds in this and the following verses, to state the reasons of their calamities, and of the judgments that had come upon them. Those judgments he traces to the crimes which he enumerates - crimes growing chiefly out of great commercial prosperity, producing pride, luxury, and idolatry.<p>Thou hast forsaken - The address is changed from the exhortation to the house of Jacob <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-5.htm">Isaiah 2:5</a> to God, as is frequently the case in the writings of Isaiah. It indicates a state where the mind is full of the subject, and where it expresses itself in a rapid and hurried manner.<p>Hast forsaken - Hast withdrawn thy protection, and given them over to the calamities and judgments which had come upon them.<p>They be replenished - Hebrew, They are "full." That is, these things abound.<p>From the East - Margin, "More than the East." The meaning of the expression it is not easy to determine. The word translated "East," &#1511;&#1491;&#1501;  qedem denotes also "antiquity," or that which is "of old," as well as the East. Hence, the Septuagint renders it, 'their land is, as of old, filled.' The Chaldee, 'their land is filled with idols as at the beginning.' Either idea will suit the passage; though our translation more nearly accords with the Hebrew than the others. The "East," that is, Arabia, Persia, Chaldea, etc., was the country where astrology, soothsaying, and divination particularly abounded; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9-11</a>.<p>And are soothsayers - Our word "soothsayers" means "foretellers, prognosticators," persons who pretend to predict future events "without inspiration," differing in this from true prophets. What the Hebrew word means, it is not so easy to determine. The word &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;  &#8219;onen&#305;&#770;ym may be derived from &#1506;&#1504;&#1503;  &#8219;a&#770;na&#770;n, "a cloud" - and then would denote those who augur from the appearance of the clouds, a species of divination from certain changes observed in the sky; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-26.htm">Leviticus 19:26</a> : 'Neither shall ye - observe times.' <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>. This species of divination was expressly forbidden; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a> : 'There shall not be found among you anyone that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter,' etc. Or the word may be derived from &#1506;&#1497;&#1503;  &#8219;ayin, "an eye," and then it will denote those who fascinate, enchant, or bewitch by the eye. It is probable that the word includes "augury, necromancy, and witchcraft," in general - all which were expressly forbidden by the law of Moses; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>.<p>Like the Philistines - The Philistines occupied the land in the southwest part of Palestine. The Septuagint uses the word "foreigners" here, as they do generally, instead of the Philistines.<p>And they please themselves - The word used here - &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1511;  s'a&#770;phaq - means literally "to clap the hands" in token of joy. It may also mean, "to join the hands, to shake hands," and then it will signify that they "joined hands" with foreigners; that is, they made compacts or entered into alliances with them contrary to the law of Moses. The Septuagint seems to understand it of unlawful marriages with the women of surrounding nations - &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;  tekna polla allophula egene&#772;the&#772; autois; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-23.htm">Nehemiah 13:23</a>. It means probably, in general, that they entered into improper alliances, whether they were military, matrimonial, or commercial, with the surrounding nations. The words "children of strangers" may mean, with the descendants of the foreigners with whom Moses forbade any alliances. The Jews were to be a separate and special people, and, in order to this, it was necessary to forbid all such foreign alliances; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31-32</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12-15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-3.htm">Psalm 106:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-5.htm">Psalm 106:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1-15</a>, <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

These words contain a reason of the divine conduct, in calling the Gentiles, and rejecting the Jews, because of the sins of the latter hereafter mentioned; though some, as the Targum and R. Moses, refer this to the Israelites; and read, "because ye have forsaken", &amp;c. and interpret it of their forsaking the Lord, his worship, and his law. What is hereafter said does not agree with the Jews, literally understood, neither in the times of Isaiah, nor when they returned from Babylon, nor in the times of Christ, nor since the destruction of Jerusalem, or in the latter day, a little before their conversion; for after the Babylonish captivity they were not given to idolatry, nor did they abound in riches, and much less since their dispersion among the nations; nor will this be their case in the latter day: wherefore Kimchi applies the whole to the times of Solomon, when the land abounded with gold and silver, with horses and chariots, and with idolatry also, in the latter part of his life: but it seems best to interpret this of antichrist and his followers, who call themselves the people of God, and the house of Jacob, say they are Jews, but are not, and are of the synagogue of Satan; and are therefore rejected of the Lord, and will be given up to utter ruin and destruction, for the evils found in them, hereafter charged with. <p>Because they be replenished from the east, or "more than the east" (s); than the eastern people, the Syrians and Chaldeans; that is, were more filled with witchcrafts and sorceries than they, as Kimchi explains it; of the sorceries of the Romish antichrist, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-21.htm">Revelation 9:21</a> the words may be rendered, "because they be full from of old time" (t); or, as of old, or more than they were of old; namely, fuller of idols than formerly; so the Targum paraphrases it, <p>"because your land is full of idols, as of old;'' <p>and so Rome Papal is as full of idols, or fuller, than Rome Pagan was. Some, as Aben Ezra, understand this of their being filled with the wisdom of the children of the east, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-30.htm">1 Kings 4:30</a> and others of the riches of the east: <p>and are soothsayers like the Philistines: who were a people given to divination and soothsaying, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-2.htm">1 Samuel 6:2</a> and some of the popes of Rome have studied the black art, and by such wicked means have got into the Papal chair; for under this may be included all evil arts and fallacious methods, by which they have deceived themselves and others: <p>and they please themselves in the children of strangers; being brought into their convents, monasteries, and nunneries; the priests and nuns vowing celibacy and virginity, and contenting themselves with the children of others: or they love strange flesh, delight in sodomitical practices, and unnatural lusts with boys and men; wherefore Rome is called Sodom and Egypt, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-8.htm">Revelation 11:8</a> or they content and delight themselves in the laws, customs, rites, ceremonies, and doctrines of other nations; many of the Gentile notions and practices being introduced into the faith and worship of the church of Rome; wherefore the Papists go by the name of Gentiles, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a>. The Targum is, <p>"and they walk in the laws of the people,'' <p>or study strange sciences, and not the statutes and laws of God; so some interpret it, as Ben Melech observes, and who also mentions another sense some give, that they please themselves in images they renew daily. <p>(s) "prae oriente, vel filiis orientis", Vatablus.

We therefore follow the lxx, Targ., and Vulg., with Gesenius and other more recent grammarians, and adopt the rendering "his work" (opus ejus). The forms &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493; (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-14.htm">Isaiah 52:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>) are two equally admissible changes of the ground-form &#1508;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493; (&#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;). As <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-29.htm">Isaiah 1:29</a> refers to idolatrous worship, poalo (his work) is an idol, a god made by human hands (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-8.htm">Isaiah 2:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-19.htm">Isaiah 37:19</a>, etc.). The prosperous idolater, who could give gold and silver for idolatrous images out of the abundance of his possessions (Cha&#770;son is to be interpreted in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-6.htm">Isaiah 33:6</a>), becomes tow (talm. "the refuse of flax:" the radical meaning is to shake out, viz., in combing), and the idol the spark which sets this mass of fibre in flames, so that they are both irretrievably consumed. For the fire of judgment, by which sinners are devoured, need not come from without. Sin carries the fire of indignation within itself. And an idol is, as it were, an idolater's sin embodied and exposed to the light of day. <p>The date of the composition of this first prophecy is a puzzle. Caspari thoroughly investigated every imaginary possibility, and at last adopted the conclusion that it dates from the time of Uzziah, inasmuch as <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-7.htm">Isaiah 1:7-9</a> do not relate to an actual, but merely to an ideal, present. But notwithstanding all the acuteness with which Caspari has worked out his view, it still remains a very forced one. The oftener we return to the reading of this prophetic address, the stronger is our impression that <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-7.htm">Isaiah 1:7-9</a> contain a description of the state of things which really existed at the time when the words were spoken. There were actually two devastations of the land of Judah which occurred during the ministry of Isaiah, and in which Jerusalem was only spared by the miraculous interposition of Jehovah: one under Ahaz in the year of the Syro-Ephraimitish war; the other under Hezekiah, when the Assyrian forces laid the land waste but were scattered at last in their attack upon Jerusalem. The year of the Syro-Ephraimitish war is supported by Gesenius, Rosenmller (who expresses a different opinion in every one of the three editions of his Scholia), Maurer, Movers, Knobel, Hvernick, and others; the time of the Assyrian oppression by Hitzig, Umbreit, Drechsler, and Luzzatto. Now, whichever of these views we may adopt, there will still remain, as a test of its admissiblity, the difficult question, How did this prophecy come to stand at the head of the book, if it belonged to the time of Uzziah-Jotham? This question, upon which the solution of the difficulty depends, can only be settled when we come to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-13</a>. Till then, the date of the composition of chapter 1 must be left undecided. It is enough for the present to know, that, according to the accounts given in the books of Kings and Chronicles, there were two occasions when the situation of Jerusalem resembled the one described in the present chapter. </body></html>
