When reproved for their sins, and threatened with judgments, they ridiculed the word of God. The Jews were guilty of idolatry before the captivity; but not after that affliction. Their zeal in the worship of false gods, may shame our indifference in the worship of the true God. The service of sin is disgraceful slavery; those who thus debase themselves to hell, will justly have their portion there. Men incline to a religion that inflames their unholy passions. They are led to do any evil, however great or vile, if they think it will atone for crimes, or purchase indulgence for some favourite lust. This explains idolatry, whether pagan, Jewish, or antichristian. But those who set up anything instead of God, for their hope and confidence, never will come to a right end. Those who forsake the only right way, wander in a thousand by-paths. The pleasures of sin soon tire, but never satisfy. Those who care not for the word of God and his providences, show they have no fear of God. Sin profits not; it ruins and destroys.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/57.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behind the doors - In every part of their habitations - behind the doors and posts and beams of their houses, they had erected the memorials of idolatrous worship.<p>Hast thou set up thy remembrance - That is, they had filled their houses with the images of tutelary gods, or with something dedicated to them. The Greeks and Romans had their Lares and Penates - their household or domestic gods - the images of which were in every family. The same was true of the apostate Hebrews. They had filled their houses with the memorials of idol-worship, and there was no part of their dwellings in which such memorials were not to be found. When a people forget God, the memorials of their apostasy will be found in every part of their habitations. The shrines of idol-gods may not be there; the beautiful images of the Greek and Roman mythology, or the clumsy devices of less refined pagans, may not be there; but the furniture, the style of living, will reveal from 'behind every door and the posts' of the house that God is forgotten, and that they are influenced by other principles than a regard to his name. The sofa, the carpet, the chandelier, the center-table, the instruments of music, the splendid mirror, may be of such workmanship as to show, as clearly as the image of a pagan god, that Yahweh is not honored in the dwelling, and that his law does not control the domestic arrangements. It may be added here that this custom of the Hebrews of placing the images of idols in their dwellings, was in direct violation of the law of Moses. They were expressly directed to write the laws of God on the posts of the house and on the gates <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-9.htm">Deuteronomy 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-20.htm">Deuteronomy 11:20</a>; and a curse was denounced against the man who made a graven or molten image and put it in a secret place <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>.<p>For thou hast discovered thyself - This language is taken from adulterous intercourse, and is designed to show the love which they had for idolatrous worship, and the extent of their unfaithfulness to God.<p>And made thee a covenant with them - Margin, 'Hewed it for thyself larger than theirs.

They hung up household tutelary gods "behind the doors"; the very place where God has directed them to write His laws "on the posts and gates" (De 6:9; 11:20); a curse, too, was pronounced on putting up an image "in a secret place" (De 27:15).<p>discovered thyself&#8212;image from an adulteress.<p>enlarged &#8230; bed&#8212;so as to receive the more paramours.<p>made &#8230; covenant&#8212;with idols: in open violation of thy "covenant" with God (Ex 19:5; 23:32).

The first part of the verse seems to allude to some form of household idolatry. Many commentators explain the expression as a violation of the command in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-9.htm" title="And you shall write them on the posts of your house, and on your gates.">Deuteronomy 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-20.htm" title="And you shall write them on the door posts of your house, and on your gates:">Deuteronomy 11:20</a>. In these passages the Israelites are directed to write certain sentences of Scripture on the doorposts of their houses, and it is supposed that the practice here denounced is placing the texts at the <span class="ital">back</span> of the door so as to be out of sight! This is an utterly improbable interpretation. The thing called “remembrance” (<span class="ital">zikkarôn</span>, better <span class="bld">memorial,</span> as R.V.) must be some heathen emblem, whose exact nature cannot be determined; and from the fact that it stood at the entrance of the house, it may be presumed to have represented the patron deity of the family.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for thou hast discovered … bed</span>] The last word appears to be the object to each of the three verbs: <span class="bld">for away from me thou hast uncovered and ascended and enlarged thy bed</span>. The connexion (“for”) may lie in the thought that they sought every possible opportunity of being unfaithful to Jehovah, their household cults being an expression of their irresistible inclination to idolatry.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and made thee</span> a covenant <span class="ital">with them &c.</span>] The sense is uncertain: either, “and thou hast made a contract with them” &c. (?); or, substituting a verb meaning “purchase” (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-6.htm" title="You shall buy meat of them for money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy water of them for money, that you may drink.">Deuteronomy 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-2.htm" title="So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:">Hosea 3:2</a>), “and thou didst procure for thee (some) of those whose bed thou lovest.” For the idea, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-16.htm" title="And of your garments you did take, and decked your high places with divers colors, and played the harlot thereupon: the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.">Ezekiel 16:16</a> ff., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-32.htm" title="But as a wife that commits adultery, which takes strangers instead of her husband!">Ezekiel 16:32</a> ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">where thou sawest it</span>] Lit. “thou hast seen a hand.” The rendering of E.V. cannot be maintained, but the real meaning of the expression is altogether obscure.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/57.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance.</span> It has been usual to explain this of a removal from its proper place into an obscure position  of the formulae which the Israelites were commanded in the Law to write on their doorposts and on their gates (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-9.htm">Deuteronomy 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-20.htm">Deuteronomy 11:20</a>). But, in the first place, there is no evidence that anciently these passages were understood literally, or that such inscriptions were ever set up; and secondly, as Mr. Cheyne remarks, they would have been more, rather than less, conspicuous in a new place. Probably, therefore, the "memorial" (<span class="accented">zikkaron</span>) of this place is some idolatrous symbol or emblem newly adopted by the Jews, and made use of as a sort of talisman. Many commentators think that it was of a phallic character (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-17.htm">Ezekiel 16:17</a>). Discovered thyself; rather, <span class="accented">uncovered thyself. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Thou hast enlarged thy bed</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> multiplied thy idolatries (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3, 4, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3-7</a>). It is a feature of the idolatry of the time, that it was a mixture adopted from many quarters. It included Baal and Ashtoreth-worship from Phoenicia, Moloch-worship from Moab and Ammos, worship of the Queen of Heaven from Syria, high-place worship from the Canaanites, and stone-worship from their own remote Mesopotamian ancestors. And made thee a covenant with them; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "a bargain for wages," that aid and protection should be rendered in return for worship and sacrifice. <span class="cmt_word">Where thou sawest it</span>.

"The righteous perisheth, and no man taketh it to heart; and pious men are swept away, without any one considering that the righteous is swept away from misfortune. He entereth into peace: they rest upon their beds, whoever has walked straight before him." With "the righteous" the prophet introduces, in glaring contrast to this luxurious living on the part of the leading men of the nation, the standing figure used to denote the fate of its best men. With this prevailing demoralization and worldliness, the righteous succumbs to the violence of both external and internal sufferings. &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;, he dies before his time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:15</a>); from the midst of the men of his generation he is carried away from this world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-2.htm">Micah 7:2</a>), and no one lays it to heart, viz., the divine accusation and threat involved in this early death. Men of piety (chesed, the love of God and man) are swept away, without there being any one to understand or consider that (k&#305;&#772; unfolds the object to be considered and laid to heart, viz., what is involved in this carrying away when regarded as a providential event) the righteous is swept away "from the evil," i.e., that he may be saved from the approaching punishment (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-20.htm">2 Kings 22:20</a>). For the prevailing corruption calls for punishment from God; and what is first of all to be expected is severe judgment, through which the coming salvation will force its way. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-2.htm">Isaiah 57:2</a> it is intimated that the righteous man and the pious do not lose the blessings of this salvation because they lose this life: for whereas, according to the prophet's watchword, there is no peace to the wicked, it is true, on the other hand, of the departing righteous man, that "he enters into peace" (sha&#770;lo&#772;m, acc. loci s. status; Ges. 118, 1); "they rest upon their beds," viz., the bottom of the grave, which has become their mishka&#770;b (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-13.htm">Job 17:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-26.htm">Job 21:26</a>), "however has walked in that which lay straight before him," i.e., the one straight plain path which he had set before him (&#1504;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493; acc. obj. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-10.htm">Isaiah 50:10</a>, Ewald, 172, b, from &#1504;&#1499;&#1495;, that which lies straight before a person; whereas &#1504;&#1499;&#1495; with &#1504;&#1499;&#1495; &#1504;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493;, signifying probably fixedness, steadiness of look, related to Arab. nkh&#803;, to pierce, &#1504;&#1499;&#1492;, percutere, is used as a preposition: compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-25.htm">Proverbs 4:25</a>, &#1500;&#1504;&#1499;&#1495;, straight or exactly before him). The grave, when compared with the restlessness of this life, is therefore "peace." He who has died in faith rests in God, to whom he has committed himself and entrusted his future. We have here the glimmering light of the New Testament consolation, that the death of the righteous is better than life in this world, because it is the entrance into peace. </body></html>
