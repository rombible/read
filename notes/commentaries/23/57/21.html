With the Lord there is neither beginning of days, nor end of life, nor change of time. His name is holy, and all must know him as a holy God. He will have tender regard to those who bring their mind to their condition, and dread his wrath. He will make his abode with those whose hearts he has thus humbled, in order to revive and comfort them. When troubles last long, even good men are tempted to entertain hard thoughts of God. Therefore He will not contend for ever, for he will not forsake the work of his own hands, nor defeat the purchase of his Son's blood. Covetousness is a sin that particularly lays men under the Divine displeasure. See the sinfulness of sin. See also that troubles cannot reform men unless God's grace work in them. Peace shall be published, perfect peace. It is the fruit of preaching lips, and praying lips. Christ came and preached peace to Gentiles, as well as to the Jews; to after-ages, who were afar off in time, as well as to those of that age. But the wicked would not be healed by God's grace, therefore would not be healed by his comforts. Their ungoverned lusts and passions made them like the troubled sea. Also the terrors of conscience disturbed their enjoyments. God hath said it, and all the world cannot unsay it, That there is no peace to those who allow themselves in any sin. If we are recovered from such an awful state, it is only by the grace of God. And the influences of the Holy Spirit, and that new heart, from whence comes grateful praise, the fruit of our lips, are his gift. Salvation, with all its fruits, hopes, and comforts, is his work, and to him belongs all the glory. There is no peace for the wicked man; but let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, and he will abundantly pardon.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/57.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There is no peace - (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-22.htm">Isaiah 48:22</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/57.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

"For thus saith the high and lofty One, the eternally dwelling One, He whose name is Holy One; I dwell on high and in the holy place, and with the contrite one and him that is of a humbled spirit, to revive the spirit of humbled ones, and to revive the heart of contrite ones." He inflicts punishment in His wrath; but to those who suffer themselves to be urged thereby to repentance and the desire for salvation, He is most inwardly and most effectually near with His grace. For the heaven of heavens is not too great for Him, and a human heart is not too small for Him to dwell in. And He who dwells upon cherubim, and among the praises of seraphim, does not scorn to dwell among the sighs of a poor human soul. He is called ra&#770;m (high), as being high and exalted in Himself; &#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; (the lofty One), as towering above all besides; and &#1506;&#1491; &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1503;. This does not mean the dweller in eternity, which is a thought quite outside the biblical range of ideas; but, since &#1506;&#1491; stands to &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1503; not in an objective, but in an attributive or adverbial relation (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7</a>, cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-33.htm">Proverbs 1:33</a>), and &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1503;, as opposed to being violently wrested from the ordinary sphere of life and work (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-9.htm">Psalm 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-29.htm">Psalm 102:29</a>), denotes a continuing life, a life having its root in itself, &#1506;&#1491; &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1503; must mean the eternally ( equals  &#1500;&#1506;&#1491;) dwelling One, i.e., He whose life lasts for ever and is always the same. He is also called qa&#770;do&#772;sh, as One who is absolutely pure and good, separated from all the uncleanness and imperfection by which creatures are characterized. This is not to be rendered sanctum nomen ejus, but sanctus; this name is the facit of His revelation of Himself in the history of salvation, which is accomplished in love and wrath, grace and judgment. This God inhabits ma&#770;ro&#772;m veqa&#770;do&#772;sh, the height and the Holy Place (accusatives of the object, like ma&#770;ro&#772;m in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-5.htm">Isaiah 33:5</a>, and mero&#772;m&#305;&#772;m in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-16.htm">Isaiah 33:16</a>), both together being equivalent to &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>), since qa&#770;do&#772;sh (neuter, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-5.htm">Psalm 46:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-5.htm">Psalm 65:5</a>) answers to &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;, and ma&#770;ro&#772;m to &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;. But He also dwells with (&#1488;&#1514; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-16.htm">Leviticus 16:16</a>) the crushed and lowly of spirit. To these He is most intimately near, and that for a salutary and gracious purpose, namely "to revive ... ." &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;e and &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; always signify either to keep that which is living alive, or to restore to life that which is dead. The spirit is the seat of pride and humility, the heart the seat of all feeling of joy and sorrow; we have therefore spiritum humilium and cor contritorum. The selfish egotism which repentance breaks has its root in the heart; and the self-consciousness, from whose false elevation repentance brings down, has its seat in the spirit (Psychol. p. 199). </body></html>
