(Comp. Wisdom 2), and, in so doing, mocking Jehovah himself. The “wide mouth,” and the “drawn-out tongue,” are the natural symbols of derision.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/57.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>57:3-12 The Lord here calls apostates and hypocrites to appear before him. When reproved for their sins, and threatened with judgments, they ridiculed the word of God. The Jews were guilty of idolatry before the captivity; but not after that affliction. Their zeal in the worship of false gods, may shame our indifference in the worship of the true God. The service of sin is disgraceful slavery; those who thus debase themselves to hell, will justly have their portion there. Men incline to a religion that inflames their unholy passions. They are led to do any evil, however great or vile, if they think it will atone for crimes, or purchase indulgence for some favourite lust. This explains idolatry, whether pagan, Jewish, or antichristian. But those who set up anything instead of God, for their hope and confidence, never will come to a right end. Those who forsake the only right way, wander in a thousand by-paths. The pleasures of sin soon tire, but never satisfy. Those who care not for the word of God and his providences, show they have no fear of God. Sin profits not; it ruins and destroys.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/57.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Against whom do ye sport yourselves? - The word here rendered 'sport' (&#1506;&#1504;&#1490;  &#8219;a&#772;nag) means properly "to live delicately and tenderly"; then "to rejoice, to take pleasure or delight." Here, however, it is evidently used in the sense of to sport oneself over anyone, that is, to deride; and the idea is, probably, that they made a sport or mockery of God, and of the institutions of religion. The prophet asks, with deep indignation and emotion, against whom they did this. Were they aware of the majesty and glory of that Being whom they thus derided?<p>Against whom make yea wide mouth? - That is, in derision or contempt <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-21.htm">Psalm 35:21</a> : 'Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me.'<p>And draw out the tongue? - Lowth, 'Loll the tongue;' or, as we would say, 'run out the tongue.' Perhaps it was done with a rapid motion, as in mockery of the true prophets when they delivered the message of God (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-16.htm">2 Chronicles 36:16</a>). Contempt was sometimes shown also by protruding the lips <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7</a> : 'They shoot out the lip;' and also by gaping upon a person <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-13.htm">Psalm 22:13</a>; 'They gaped upon me with their mouths.'<p>Are ye not children of transgression? - That is, in view of the fact that you make a sport of sacred things, and deride the laws and the prophets of God.<p>A seed of false-hood - A generation that is unfaithful to God and to his cause. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/57.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. sport yourselves&#8212;make a mock (Isa 66:5).

"His watchmen are blind: they (are) all ignorant, they (are) all dumb dogs that cannot bark; raving, lying down, loving to slumber. And the dogs are mightily greedy, they know no satiety; and such are shepherds! They know no understanding; they have all turned to their own ways, every one for his own gain throughout his border." The "watchmen" are the prophets here, as everywhere else (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8</a>, cf., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-6.htm">Isaiah 21:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-17.htm">Jeremiah 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>). The prophet is like a watchman (tso&#772;pheh) stationed upon his watch-tower (specula), whose duty it is, when he sees the sword come upon the land, to blow the sho&#772;pha&#770;r, and warn the people (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-1.htm">Ezekiel 33:1-9</a>). But just as Jeremiah speaks of bad prophets among the captives (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29.htm">Jeremiah 29</a>), and the book of Ezekiel is full of reproaches at the existing neglect of the office of watchman and shepherd; so does the prophet here complain that the watchmen of the nation are blind, in direct opposition to both their title and their calling; they are all without either knowledge or the capacity for knowledge (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-20.htm">Isaiah 45:20</a>). They ought to resemble watchful sheep-dogs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-1.htm">Job 30:1</a>), which bark when the flock is threatened; but they are dumb, and cannot bark (na&#770;bhach, root nab), and leave the flock to all its danger. Instead of being "seers" (cho&#772;z&#305;&#772;m), they are ravers (ho&#772;z&#305;&#772;m; cf., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18</a>, where we have a play upon &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1505; in &#1492;&#1492;&#1512;&#1505;). &#1492;&#1494;&#1497;&#1501;, from &#1492;&#1494;&#1492;, to rave in sickness, n. act. hadhajan (which Kimchi compares to parlare in snno); hence the Targum &#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; A &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, S &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;, Jer. videntes vana. The predicates which follow are attached to the leading word ho&#772;z&#305;&#772;m (raving), if not precisely as adjectives, yet as more minutely descriptive. Instead of watching, praying, wrestling, to render themselves susceptible of visions of divine revelations for the good of their people, and to keep themselves in readiness to receive them, they are idle, loving comfortable ease, talkers in their sleep. And the dogs, viz., those prophets who resemble the worst of them (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>), are &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;, of violent, unrestrained soul, insatiable. Their soul lives and moves in the lowest parts of their nature; it is nothing but selfish avarice, self-indulgent greediness, violent restlessness of passion, that revolves perpetually around itself. With the words "and these are shepherds," the range of the prophet's vision is extended to the leaders of the nation generally; for when the prophet adds as an exclamation, "And such (hi  equals  tales) are shepherds!" he applies the glaring contrast between calling and conduct to the holders of both offices, that of teacher and that of ruler alike. For, apart from the accents, it would be quite at variance with the general use of the personal pronoun &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, to apply it to any other persons than those just described (viz., in any such sense as this: "And those, who ought to be shepherds, do not know"). Nor is it admissible to commence an adversative minor clause with &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, as Knobel does, "whereas they are shepherds;" for, since the principal clause has  &#1492;&#1499;&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; (dogs) as the subject, this would introduce a heterogeneous mixture of the two figures, shepherds' dogs and shepherds. We therefore take &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492; as an independent clause: "And it is upon men of such a kind, that the duty of watching and tending the nation devolves!" These &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; (for which the Targum reads &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;) are then still further described: they know not to understand, i.e., they are without spiritual capacity to pass an intelligible judgment (compare the opposite combination of the two verbs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-4.htm">Isaiah 32:4</a>); instead of caring for the general good, they have all turned to their own way (ledarka&#770;m), i.e., to their own selfish interests, every one bent upon his own advantage (&#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506; from &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506;, abscindere, as we say, seinen Schnitt zu machen, to reap an advantage, lit., to make an incision). &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1510;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, from his utmost extremity (i.e., from that of his own station, including all its members), in other words, "throughout the length and breadth of his own circle;" qa&#770;tseh, the end, being regarded not as the terminal point, but as the circumference (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-4.htm">Genesis 19:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-21.htm">Genesis 47:21</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-31.htm">Jeremiah 51:31</a>). </body></html>
