In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-18.htm" title="And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it.">Genesis 28:18</a> we have, at least, an analogous practice, which might easily become identical. Among the Phœnicians such stones were known as <span class= "ital">Bœtulia </span>(probably a Grecised form of Bethel), and were connected with the worship of the reproductive powers of nature. As the true portion of Israel was emphatically Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-16.htm" title="The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts is his name.">Jeremiah 10:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-5.htm" title="The LORD is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: you maintain my lot.">Psalm 16:5</a>) there is an indignant irony in the word thus used. The idolaters had chosen a <span class= "ital">fetish </span>instead of the Eternal One. In <span class= "ital">thy portion, </span>we have the feminine singular, designating Israel as the faithless wife.<p><span class= "bld">Should I receive comfort in these?</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> better, <span class= "ital">Should I be quiet in spite of all this? </span>(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-7.htm" title="How shall I pardon you for this? your children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses.">Jeremiah 5:7</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/57.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>57:3-12 The Lord here calls apostates and hypocrites to appear before him. When reproved for their sins, and threatened with judgments, they ridiculed the word of God. The Jews were guilty of idolatry before the captivity; but not after that affliction. Their zeal in the worship of false gods, may shame our indifference in the worship of the true God. The service of sin is disgraceful slavery; those who thus debase themselves to hell, will justly have their portion there. Men incline to a religion that inflames their unholy passions. They are led to do any evil, however great or vile, if they think it will atone for crimes, or purchase indulgence for some favourite lust. This explains idolatry, whether pagan, Jewish, or antichristian. But those who set up anything instead of God, for their hope and confidence, never will come to a right end. Those who forsake the only right way, wander in a thousand by-paths. The pleasures of sin soon tire, but never satisfy. Those who care not for the word of God and his providences, show they have no fear of God. Sin profits not; it ruins and destroys.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/57.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Among the smooth stones of the streams - In the original here, there is a paronomasia, which cannot be fully retained in our English version. There has been also considerable diversity of opinion in regard to the sense of the passage, from the ambiguity of the words in the original. Jerome (the Vulgate) renders it, In partibus torrentis pars tua - 'Thy portion is in the parts of the torrent.' The Septuagint translates it 'This is thy portion; this is thy lot. The word rendered in our version, 'smooth stones' (&#1495;&#1500;&#1511;  che&#772;leq), means properly smoothness, hence, barrenness or bare place; and supposes that the idea is, their lot was in the bare places of the valley, that is, in the open (not wooded) places where they worshipped idols - an interpretation not very consistent with the fact that groves were commonly selected as the place where they worshipped idols. It seems to me, therefore, that the idea of smoothness here, whether of the valley or of the stones, is not the idea intended. Indeed, in no place, it is believed, does the word mean 'smooth stones;' and it is difficult to conceive what was the exact idea which our translators intended to convey, or why they supposed that such worship was celebrated among the smooth or much-worn stones of the running stream. The true idea can probably be obtained by reverting to the primitive sense of the word as derived from the verb. The verb &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;  cha&#770;laq means:<p>1. To smooth.<p>2. To divide, to distribute, to appropriate - as the dividing of spoil, etc.<p>Hence, the noun also means dividing, or portion, as that which is divided - whether an inheritance, or whether the dividings of spoil after battle. Retaining this idea, the literal sense, as I conceive, would be this in which also something of the paronomasia will be retained: 'Among the dividings of the valley is thy dividing,' that is, thy portion In the places where the valley divides, is thy lot. Thy lot is there instead of the place which God appointed. There you worship; there you pour out your libations to the false gods; and there you must partake of the protection and favor which the gods whom you worship can give. You have chosen that as your inheritance, and by the results of that you must abide.<p>Of the stream - The word rendered here 'stream' (&#1504;&#1495;&#1500;  nachal), means either a stream, or a rivulet of water <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-5.htm">Numbers 34:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-4.htm">Joshua 15:4-47</a>; or it means a valley with a brook or torrent; a low place with water. Here it means evidently the latter - as it cannot be supposed they would worship in a stream, though they undoubtedly worshipped in a vale or low place where there was occasionally a rivulet of water. This entire description is strikingly applicable to the valley of Jehoshaphat - a low vale, broken by chasms and by projecting and overhanging rocks, and along the center of which flowed a small brook, much swelled occasionally by the waters that fell from the adjacent hills. At some seasons of the year, however, the valley was entirely dry. The idea here is, that they had chosen their portion in the dividings of that valley instead of the adjacent hills on which the worship of God was celebrated. That valley became afterward the emblem of punishment: and may it not be implied in this passage that they were to inherit whatever would descend on that valley; that is, that they were to participate in the punishment which would be the just expression of the divine displeasure?<p>Even to them hast thou poured out - That is, to these idols erected in the valleys.<p>A drink-offering - A libation, or drink-offering was usually poured out in the worship of pagan gods <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18</a>. It was common also in the worship of the true God (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-14.htm">Genesis 35:14</a>). Among the Hebrews it consisted of wine and oil <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-5.htm">Numbers 15:5-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-13.htm">Leviticus 23:13</a>.<p>Thou hast offered a meat-offering - On the word used here (&#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492;  mincha&#772;h) see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-23.htm">Isaiah 43:23</a>. The word 'meat' formerly denoted in the English language food in general, and was not confined as it is now to animal food. Hence, the word 'meat-offering' is so often used in the Scriptures when a sacrifice is intended which was not a bloody sacrifice. The mincha was in fact an offering of meal, fine flour, etc., mingled with oil <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-10.htm">Leviticus 14:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/7-13.htm">Numbers 7:13</a>, and was distinguished expressly from the bloody sacrifice. The word 'meal-offering' would much more appropriately express the sense of the original than 'meat-offering.' This was a common offering made to idols as well as to the true God, and was designed as an expression of thankfulness.<p>Should I receive comfort in these? - It is implied that God could not behold them but with displeasure, and that for them he would punish them.

Or thy god; but the portion of Jacob is not like them, stocks and stones, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-16.htm">Jeremiah 10:16</a>. Whenever they could pick up smooth stones, and such as were fit for their purpose, whether in the stream of a brook, or in a valley, as the word also signifies, they polished and formed them into an image, and made gods of them; and these were their portion and inheritance, and which they left to their children. There is an elegant play on words (k) in the Hebrew tongue, between the word for "smooth stones", and that for a "portion (l)", which cannot be expressed in our language: or, "in the smooth or slippery places of the valley shall be thy portions"; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-6.htm">Psalm 35:6</a>. <p>They, they are thy lot; even those stones. Jarchi's note is, to stone thee with, the punishment of idolaters with the Jews; suggesting that those idols would be their ruin; as they will be the ruin of the idolatrous members of the church of Rome, who repent not of worshipping their idols of stone among others, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-20.htm">Revelation 9:20</a>, <p>even to them hast thou poured a drink offering, thou hast offered a meat offering; or a "bread offering", as well as a libation of wine, respecting the sacrifice of the mass, which consists of bread and wine, which is offered up in honour of their idols, angels and saints; hence "Michael mass" and "Martin mass", &amp;c. <p>Should I receive comfort in these? be pleased with such idolatrous sacrifices? no. The Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and Arabic versions render it, "should I not be angry for these?" I will; I have just reason for it. Or it may be rendered, "shall I repent of these (m)?" of the evil I have threatened to bring, and am about to bring upon these idolaters? I will not. <p>(k)  .

As commonly explained, the verse refers to the worship of stone fetishes; but this is very doubtful. It is obvious, indeed, that by the <span class="bld">smooth (ones) of the wadi</span> some objects of worship are denoted, but is it necessary to suppose that they were smooth <span class="ital">stones</span>? The expression “smooth ones” (<span class="ital">ḥalqê</span>) is chosen for the sake of a play of words between it and “portion” (<span class="ital">ḥçleq</span>). If we take it literally it is of course natural to think of stones worn smooth by the winter torrents (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-40.htm" title="And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a money; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.">1 Samuel 17:40</a>), although even then there is force in Duhm’s observation that such featureless objects were least of all likely to be chosen as fetishes. (See Tylor, <span class="ital">Primitive Culture</span>3, Vol. ii. p. 144 f.) But the word occurs in the metaphorical sense of “slippery,” flattering, deceitful (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-24.htm" title="For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.">Ezekiel 12:24</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-5.htm" title="That they may keep you from the strange woman, from the stranger which flatters with her words.">Proverbs 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-21.htm" title="With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.">Proverbs 7:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-5.htm" title="A man that flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his feet.">Proverbs 29:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-9.htm" title="For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulcher; they flatter with their tongue.">Psalm 5:9</a>, &c.); and such a term might readily be applied to false gods of any kind (cf. e.g. “lies” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-4.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:">Amos 2:4</a>). We may therefore render (following Duhm), “In the deceivers of the wadi is thy portion”; although the special connexion of the deities with the wadi remains obscure.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thy portion</span>] As Jehovah is said to be the portion of His people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-19.htm" title="And lest you lift up your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, should be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD your God has divided to all nations under the whole heaven.">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-16.htm" title="The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts is his name.">Jeremiah 10:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-5.htm" title="The LORD is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: you maintain my lot.">Psalm 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-6.htm" title="Attend to my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.">Psalm 142:6</a>) so these deceitful beings are the portion of those who do homage to them in the manner described in the second half of the verse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thou hast offered a meat-offering</span>] or, more generally, <span class="bld">an oblation</span>, as R.V.
