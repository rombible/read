When reproved for their sins, and threatened with judgments, they ridiculed the word of God. The Jews were guilty of idolatry before the captivity; but not after that affliction. Their zeal in the worship of false gods, may shame our indifference in the worship of the true God. The service of sin is disgraceful slavery; those who thus debase themselves to hell, will justly have their portion there. Men incline to a religion that inflames their unholy passions. They are led to do any evil, however great or vile, if they think it will atone for crimes, or purchase indulgence for some favourite lust. This explains idolatry, whether pagan, Jewish, or antichristian. But those who set up anything instead of God, for their hope and confidence, never will come to a right end. Those who forsake the only right way, wander in a thousand by-paths. The pleasures of sin soon tire, but never satisfy. Those who care not for the word of God and his providences, show they have no fear of God. Sin profits not; it ruins and destroys.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/57.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Inflaming yourselves - Burning, that is, with lust. The whole language here is derived from adulterous intercourse. The sense is, that they were greatly addicted to idolatry, and that they used every means to increase and extend the practice of it. The Vulgate, however, renders this, 'Who console yourselves.' The Septuagint renders it, 'Invoking (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  parakalountes) idols.' But the proper meaning of the Hebrew word &#1495;&#1502;&#1501;  cha&#770;mam is, "to become warm; to be inflamed, or to burn as with lust."<p>With idols - Margin, 'Among the oaks.' Hebrew, &#1489;&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;  ba&#772;'e&#772;l&#305;&#770;ym. Vulgate, In diis - 'With the gods.' Septuagint, &#x395;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;  Eido&#772;la - 'Idols.' So the Chaldee and Syriac. The Hebrew may denote 'with gods,' that is, with idol-gods; or it may denote, as in the margin, 'among the oaks,' or the terebinth groves, from &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;  'e&#772;yl, plural &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;  'e&#772;yl&#305;&#770;ym, or &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;  'e&#772;lym (the terebinth). See the word explained in the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-29.htm">Isaiah 1:29</a>. Kimchi and Jarchi here render it by 'the terebinth tree.' Lowth renders it, 'Burning with the lust of idols;' and probably this is the correct interpretation, for, if it had meant oaks or the terebinth tree, the phrase would have been "under" (&#1514;&#1495;&#1514;  tachath) instead of "in" or "with" (&#1489;  b).<p>Under every green tree - (See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-29.htm">Isaiah 1:29</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-2.htm">Deuteronomy 22:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-4.htm">2 Chronicles 28:4</a>).<p>Slaying the children - That is, sacrificing them to the idol-gods. This was commonly done by burning them, as when they were offered to Moloch, though it is not improbable that they were sometimes sacrificed in other ways. It was a common custom among the worshippers of Moloch. Thus it is said of Ahaz <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>, that he 'burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire.' The same thing is said of Manasseh, to whose time the prophet most probably refers. 'And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-6.htm">2 Chronicles 33:6</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>). The same thing was practiced in the countries of the Babylonian empire <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-31.htm">2 Kings 17:31</a>, and from <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>, it is evident that it was commonly practiced by pagan nations. The Phenicians, according to Eusebius (Praep. Evan. iv. 16), and the Carthagenians, according to Diodorus Siculus (xx. 14), practiced it.<p>In the valleys - The place where these abominations were practiced by the Jews was the valley of the son of Hinnom (see the references above); that is, the valley of Jehoshaphat, lying to the south and the southeast of Jerusalem. A large hollow, brass statue was erected, and the fire was enkindled within it, and the child was placed in his heated arms, and thus put to death. The cries of the child were drowned by the music of the &#1514;&#1507;  to&#770;ph, or kettle-drums (see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>, where this instrument is fully described), and hence, the name of the valley was Tophet.<p>Under the clefts of the rocks - Dark and shady groves, and deep and sombre caverns were the places where the abominable rites of the pagan superstitions were practiced (compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/57.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

Or it may intend the ruining and destroying the souls of such, who, before they fell into their hands, were innocent as children, by their superstitious worship and idolatry, committed in low and dark places, under cragged rocks, and in caves and dens; such as the above mentioned commentator speaks of, a very dark one, under a prominent rock, in which the ignorant and unhappy people, some time ago, worshipped and invoked a certain blessed saint, he knew not who, which could scarce be looked into without horror; and such was the cave in which they worshipped the angel Michael. <p>(h)  "inflammati inter quercus", Gataker; "incalescentes, vel incalescitis inter quercus, vel ulmos", Vatablus.

The reference is, as Mr. Cheyne says, to the "orgiastic cults' in the sacred groves of Palestinian heathenism." The nature of these cults is well stated by Professor Dollinger ('Jew and Gentile,' vol. 1. p. 430): "At the spring festival, called by some the 'brand-feast,' by others that of torches, which was attended by streams of visitors from every country, huge trees were burnt, with the offerings suspended on them. Even children were sacrificed; they were put into a leathern bag, and thrown the whole height of the temple to the bottom, with the shocking expression that they were calves, and not children. In the fore-court stood two gigantic phalli. To the exciting din of drums, flutes, and inspired songs, the Galli cut themselves on the arms; and the effect of this act, and of the music accompanying it, was so strong upon mere spectators, that all their bodily and mental powers were thrown into a tumult of excitement; and they too, seized by the desire to lacerate themselves, deprived themselves of their manhood by means of potsherds lying ready for the purpose<span class="cmt_word">." Slaying the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks.</span> The sacrifice of their children to Moloch was largely practised by the Jews in the later period of the kingdom of Judah. It seems to have been originally introduced by the superstitious Ahaz, the father of Hezekiah, who "made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>). Suspended during the reign of Hezekiah, it was renewed under Manasseh, who followed the example of his grandfather in himself sacrificing one of his sons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>). Under the last three kings it prevailed to a very wide extent, and the prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel are loud in their denunciations of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31, 32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-2.htm">Jeremiah 19:2-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-35.htm">Jeremiah 32:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-20.htm">Ezekiel 16:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-26.htm">Ezekiel 20:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-37.htm">Ezekiel 23:37</a>, etc.). Arguments have been brought forward to prove that the child was merely passed before a fire, or between two fires, and not burnt; but the evidence to the contrary is overwhelming (see the article on "Moloch" in Dr. W. Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 2, pp. 403, 404). The rite belonged especially to the worship of Chemosh and Moloch by the Moabites and Ammonites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>), from whom it was adopted by the Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7</a>) and Jews. The sacrifice was supposed to be expiatory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>). In the later times of the Jewish kingdom the place of sacrifice was the valley of Hinnom, west and north of Jerusalem, which is overhung by rugged rocks. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/56.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet now proceeds with &#1510;&#1508;&#1493; (&#1510;&#1508;&#1497;&#1493;): the suffix refers to Israel, which was also the object to &#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;. "His watchmen are blind: they (are) all ignorant, they (are) all dumb dogs that cannot bark; raving, lying down, loving to slumber. And the dogs are mightily greedy, they know no satiety; and such are shepherds! They know no understanding; they have all turned to their own ways, every one for his own gain throughout his border." The "watchmen" are the prophets here, as everywhere else (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8</a>, cf., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-6.htm">Isaiah 21:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-17.htm">Jeremiah 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>). The prophet is like a watchman (tso&#772;pheh) stationed upon his watch-tower (specula), whose duty it is, when he sees the sword come upon the land, to blow the sho&#772;pha&#770;r, and warn the people (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-1.htm">Ezekiel 33:1-9</a>). But just as Jeremiah speaks of bad prophets among the captives (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29.htm">Jeremiah 29</a>), and the book of Ezekiel is full of reproaches at the existing neglect of the office of watchman and shepherd; so does the prophet here complain that the watchmen of the nation are blind, in direct opposition to both their title and their calling; they are all without either knowledge or the capacity for knowledge (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-20.htm">Isaiah 45:20</a>).

Instead of watching, praying, wrestling, to render themselves susceptible of visions of divine revelations for the good of their people, and to keep themselves in readiness to receive them, they are idle, loving comfortable ease, talkers in their sleep. And the dogs, viz., those prophets who resemble the worst of them (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>), are &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;, of violent, unrestrained soul, insatiable. Their soul lives and moves in the lowest parts of their nature; it is nothing but selfish avarice, self-indulgent greediness, violent restlessness of passion, that revolves perpetually around itself. With the words "and these are shepherds," the range of the prophet's vision is extended to the leaders of the nation generally; for when the prophet adds as an exclamation, "And such (hi  equals  tales) are shepherds!" he applies the glaring contrast between calling and conduct to the holders of both offices, that of teacher and that of ruler alike. For, apart from the accents, it would be quite at variance with the general use of the personal pronoun &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, to apply it to any other persons than those just described (viz., in any such sense as this: "And those, who ought to be shepherds, do not know"). Nor is it admissible to commence an adversative minor clause with &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, as Knobel does, "whereas they are shepherds;" for, since the principal clause has  &#1492;&#1499;&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; (dogs) as the subject, this would introduce a heterogeneous mixture of the two figures, shepherds' dogs and shepherds. We therefore take &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492; as an independent clause: "And it is upon men of such a kind, that the duty of watching and tending the nation devolves!" These &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; (for which the Targum reads &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;) are then still further described: they know not to understand, i.e., they are without spiritual capacity to pass an intelligible judgment (compare the opposite combination of the two verbs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-4.htm">Isaiah 32:4</a>); instead of caring for the general good, they have all turned to their own way (ledarka&#770;m), i.e., to their own selfish interests, every one bent upon his own advantage (&#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506; from &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506;, abscindere, as we say, seinen Schnitt zu machen, to reap an advantage, lit., to make an incision). &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1510;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, from his utmost extremity (i.e., from that of his own station, including all its members), in other words, "throughout the length and breadth of his own circle;" qa&#770;tseh, the end, being regarded not as the terminal point, but as the circumference (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-4.htm">Genesis 19:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-21.htm">Genesis 47:21</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-31.htm">Jeremiah 51:31</a>). </body></html>
