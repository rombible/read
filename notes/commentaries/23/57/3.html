It seems, however, by many of the expressions which the prophet uses, that he is rather giving a description of the corrupt state of the Jewish Church, before the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans. <span class="ital">Draw near hither </span>— To God’s tribunal, to receive your sentence; <span class="ital">ye sons of the sorceress </span>— Not by propagation, but by imitation, those being frequently called men’s sons that follow their example: <span class="ital">the seed of the adulterer, </span>&c. — Not the genuine children of Abraham, as you pretend and boast yourselves to be; your dispositions being far more suitable to a spurious brood than to Abraham’s seed. <span class="ital">Against whom do you sport yourselves? </span>— Consider who it is that you mock and scoff at when you deride God’s prophets, (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-14.htm" title="Why hear the word of the LORD, you scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem.">Isaiah 28:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-22.htm" title="Now therefore be you not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined on the whole earth.">Isaiah 28:22</a>,) and know that it is not so much men that you insult, as God, whose cause they plead, and in whose name they speak. <span class="ital">Are ye not a seed of falsehood </span>— A generation of liars, whose practices contradict your professions, who deal deceitfully both with God and man?<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/57.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>57:3-12 The Lord here calls apostates and hypocrites to appear before him. When reproved for their sins, and threatened with judgments, they ridiculed the word of God. The Jews were guilty of idolatry before the captivity; but not after that affliction. Their zeal in the worship of false gods, may shame our indifference in the worship of the true God. The service of sin is disgraceful slavery; those who thus debase themselves to hell, will justly have their portion there. Men incline to a religion that inflames their unholy passions. They are led to do any evil, however great or vile, if they think it will atone for crimes, or purchase indulgence for some favourite lust. This explains idolatry, whether pagan, Jewish, or antichristian. But those who set up anything instead of God, for their hope and confidence, never will come to a right end. Those who forsake the only right way, wander in a thousand by-paths. The pleasures of sin soon tire, but never satisfy. Those who care not for the word of God and his providences, show they have no fear of God. Sin profits not; it ruins and destroys.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/57.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But draw near hither - That is, come near to hear the solemn sentence which God pronounces in regard to your character and doom.

On the meaning of the word used here, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-6.htm">Isaiah 2:6</a>. The Hebrews, like other inhabitants of the East, were much addicted to this, and particularly in the time of Manasseh <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a> : 'And he made his sons pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits, and wizards.' So much were they devoted to this in his time, that they might be called, by way of eminence, 'the sons of the sorceress;' as if a sorceress had been their mother, and they had grown up to walk in her steps, and to imitate her example.<p>The seed of the adulterer - Implying that the obligations of the marriage contract were disregarded, and that licentiousness prevailed in the nation. Amidst the other abominations which existed under the wicked and corrupt reign of Manasseh <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21.htm">2 Kings 21</a>, there is every probability that these sins also abounded. Licentiousness had been the invariable attendant on idol-worship; and dissoluteness of manners is the usual accompaniment of all other crimes. It is observable also that the Saviour often charges the same sin on the nation in his own time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-39.htm">Matthew 12:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-4.htm">Matthew 16:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-1.htm">John 8:1</a> ff.) In the language here, however, there is a reference to the fact that the nation had apostatized from God, and they were guilty of spiritual adultery - that is, of unfaithfulness to God. They fixed their affections on other objects than God, and loved the images of idol-worship more than they did their Creator. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/57.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

Invective against an idolatrous party.—With regard to the reference of this obscure and difficult passage the following points have to be noticed: (1) The scenery of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/57-5.htm" title="Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks?...">Isaiah 57:5-6</a></span> is unmistakeably Palestinian (wadis, clefts of the rock, terebinths). (2) Several of the rites specified bear the complexion of Canaanitish heathenism, and could not have been performed in Babylonia. (3) The opening words (“But ye”) seem to imply that the people addressed are distinct from those whose leaders are denounced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/56-10.htm" title="His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber....">Isaiah 56:10-12</a>. (4) Those spoken of are animated by contempt and hatred of the cause and people of Jehovah (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-4.htm" title="Against whom do you sport yourselves? against whom make you a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are you not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood.">Isaiah 57:4</a></span>), while at the same time they advance pretensions to “righteousness” or correctness of religious standing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-12.htm" title="I will declare your righteousness, and your works; for they shall not profit you.">Isaiah 57:12</a>). (5) They have persisted in their abominations down to the time of the prophecy (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/57-10.htm" title="You are wearied in the greatness of your way; yet said you not, There is no hope: you have found the life of your hand; therefore you were not grieved....">Isaiah 57:10-13</a></span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the supposition that the prophecy was written after the return from Babylon, there is much plausibility in the view that the party here addressed is the Samaritan community. This theory is at all events simpler than that advocated by the majority of critics, who have felt the force of the objections against exilic authorship, and have accordingly supposed that the passage (or its original) was written at some time previous to the Captivity and borrowed by the great prophet of the Exile as a warning against idolatrous tendencies which still manifested themselves in Babylon. (See further Introduction, pp. lvii, lix). The connexion between this section and the preceding would be explained by the fact that the Jewish aristocracy cultivated friendly relations with the Samaritans; there was a serious danger that the struggling Jewish community should by these alliances be dragged down to the level of their semi-pagan neighbours.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/57.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-14.</span> - ISRAEL SEVERELY REBUKED FOR IDOLATRY.

We decide, for our part, in favour of the former. If <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-9.htm">Isaiah 56:9</a>. formed an antithetical second half to the promising first half in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-1.htm">Isaiah 56:1-8</a>, we should expect to find the prophets and leaders of Israel, whose licentiousness and want of principle are here so severely condemned, threatened with destruction in the heathen land, whilst true proselytes and even eunuchs were brought to the holy mountain. But we meet with this antithesis for the first time in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-13.htm">Isaiah 57:13</a>, where we evidently find ourselves in the midst of another prophetic address. And where can that address commence, if not at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-9.htm">Isaiah 56:9</a>, from which point onwards we have that hard, dull, sharp, and concise language of strong indignation, which recals to mind psalms written "in a thundering style" (Psalter, i. 80) and the reproachful addresses of Jeremiah, and which passes again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-11.htm">Isaiah 57:11</a>. into the lofty crystalline language peculiar to our prophet's "book of consolation?" The new prophetic address commences, like <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>, with a summons. "All ye beasts of the field, come near! To devour, all ye beasts in the forest!" According to the accentuation before us (&#1500;&#1499;&#1500; mercha, &#1499;&#1500;&#1495;&#1470;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; tiphchah), the beasts of the field are summoned to devour the beasts in the forest. This accentuation, however, is false, and must be exchanged for another which is supported by some MSS, viz., &#1500;&#1499;&#1500; tiphchah, &#1499;&#1500;&#1495;&#1470;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; mercha, and &#1489;&#1497;&#1506;&#1512; Beth raphatum. It is true that even with these accents we might still adhere to the view favoured by Jewish commentators, viz., that the beasts of the field are to be devoured by the beasts of the forest, if this view yielded any admissible sense (compare, for example, that supported by Meyer, "Ye enemies, devour the scattered ones of my congregation"), and had not against it the synonymous parallelism of &#1513;&#1491;&#1497; &#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; and &#1489;&#1497;&#1506;&#1512; &#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-20.htm">Isaiah 43:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-11.htm">Psalm 104:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-20.htm">Psalm 104:20</a>; cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>). But there remains another view, according to which &#1489;&#1497;&#1506;&#1512; &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; is a second vocative answering to &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497; &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;. According to the Targum, what is to be devoured is the great body of heathen kings attacking Jerusalem; according to Jerome, Cyril, Stier, etc., the pasture and food provided by the grace of God. But what follows teaches us something different from this. Israel has prophets and shepherds, who are blind to every coming danger, and therefore fail to give warning of its approach, because they are sunken in selfishness and debauchery. It resembles a flock with a keeper, and therefore an easy prey (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-5.htm">Ezekiel 34:5</a>); and the meaning of the appeal, which is certainly addressed to the nations of the world, the enemies of the people of God, is this: "Ye have only to draw near; ye can feed undisturbed, and devour as much as ye please." This is the explanation adopted by most of the more modern commentators. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-9.htm">Jeremiah 12:9</a>, which is founded upon this ("Assemble all ye beasts of the field, bring them hither to devour"), it is also Jerusalem which is assigned as food to the heathen. The parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-9.htm">Isaiah 56:9</a> is both synonymous and progressive. The writer seeks for rare forms, because he is about to depict a rare inversion of the proper state of things. &#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; (with the first syllable loosely closed) is the antiquated form of connection, which was admissible even with &#1489;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; following (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-21.htm">2 Samuel 1:21</a>). On &#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; ( equals  &#1488;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;), see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-12.htm">Isaiah 21:12</a> (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-14.htm">Isaiah 21:14</a>). </body></html>
