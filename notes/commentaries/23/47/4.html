As such it finds a parallel in the overthrow of the mystical Babylon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-20.htm" title="Rejoice over her, you heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets; for God has avenged you on her.">Revelation 18:20</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Sit thou silent.</span>—Another contrast between the stir of the rejoicing city and the stillness of its later desolation. “The lady” (we might almost say, <span class= "ital">the empress</span>) “of kingdoms” was reduced to the loneliness of widowhood.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/47.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-4.htm" title="As for our redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel.">Isaiah 47:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">As for our Redeemer, </span>&c. — The words, <span class="ital">as for, </span>not being in the Hebrew text, Bishop Lowth translates this verse, “Our Avenger, Jehovah God of hosts, the Holy One of Israel, is his name.” And he observes, “Here a chorus breaks in upon the midst of the subject, with a change of construction as well as sentiment, from the longer to the shorter kind of verse; after which, the former subject and style are resumed.” The passage seems to be inserted in the midst of this prophecy against Babylon, as Jacob inserts a like passage in the midst of his blessings and prophecies concerning his sons, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-18.htm" title="I have waited for your salvation, O LORD.">Genesis 49:18</a>.

If the words be considered as a pathetical exclamation, or acclamation of God’s people, they thereby ascribe to God, as their God and Redeemer, this wonderful work of breaking the staff of their oppressors: and they make their boast of, and celebrate him for, this glorious deliverance.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/47.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>47:1-6 Babylon is represented under the emblem of a female in deep distress. She was to be degraded and endure sufferings; and is represented sitting on the ground, grinding at the handmill, the lowest and most laborious service. God was righteous in his vengeance, and none should interpose. The prophet exults in the Lord of hosts, as the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel. God often permits wicked men to prevail against his people; but those who cruelly oppress them will be punished.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/47.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As for our Redeemer - This verse stands absolutely, and is not connected with the preceding or the following. It seems to be an expression of admiration, or of grateful surprise, by which the prophet saw Yahweh as the Redeemer of his people. He saw, in vision, Babylon humbled, and, full of the subject, he breaks out into an expression of grateful surprise and rejoicing. 'O! our Redeemer! it is the work of our Saviour, the Holy One of Israel! How great is his power! How faithful is he! How manifestly is he revealed! Babylon is destroyed. Her idols could not save her. Her destruction has been accomplished by him who is the Redeemer of his people, and the Holy One of Israel.' Lowth regards this verse as the language of a chorus that breaks in upon the midst of the subject, celebrating the praises of God. The subject is resumed in the next verse. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/47.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. As for&#8212;rather supply, "Thus saith our Redeemer" [Maurer]. Lowth supposes this verse to be the exclamation of a chorus breaking in with praises, "Our Redeemer! Jehovah of hosts," &c. (Jer 50:34).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/47.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> According to this version, the prophet inserteth this passage in the midst of this prophecy against Babylon, as Jacob inserteth a like passage in the midst of his blessings and prophecies concerning his children, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-18.htm" title="I have waited for your salvation, O LORD.">Genesis 49:18</a></span>. And this may be here interposed, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. As the reason why the judgment here denounced should be certainly inflicted, because he who had undertaken it was the <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Lord of hosts, </span> and therefore able to effect it, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the Holy One, </span> and <span class="ital">the Redeemer of Israel</span>, whom the Babylonians had cruelly oppressed, whose quarrel God would avenge upon them, and whom he had determined and promised to deliver out of their hands.

As a pathetical exclamation or acclamation of God’s people for this wonderful work of breaking the staff of their oppressors, which they here ascribe to God, as he is their God and Redeemer, whom they here make their boast of, and whom they celebrate for this glorious deliverance. But because these words, as for, are not in the Hebrew text, and therefore another word may be as conveniently supplied, this verse may be, and is by some learned interpreters, otherwise rendered, and joined with the foregoing words thus, <span class="ital">I will take vengeance, and I will not meet thee as a man, saith our Redeemer, whose name is the Lord of Hosts, the Holy One of Israel</span>. For the word <span class="ital">saith</span> or <span class="ital">saying</span> is frequently understood, and therefore supplied by translators, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-34.htm" title="And Ben-hadad said to him, The cities, which my father took from your father, I will restore; and you shall make streets for you in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.

Or, "saith our Redeemer", as it may be supplied (e): or, "our Redeemer" will do this; inflict this punishment on Babylon, even he who has undertook our cause, and will deliver us from the Babylonish yoke, and return us to our land: these are the words of the Lord's people, expressing their faith in the things foretold of Babylon, and in their own deliverance: <p>the Lord of hosts is his name; and therefore able to redeem his people, and destroy his enemies, being the Lord of armies above and below, and having all at his command: <p>the Holy One of Israel; the sanctifier of them, their covenant God, and therefore will save them, and destroy their enemies, being hateful to him, because unholy and impure. <p>(e) "Inquit viudex noster", Junius &amp; Tremellius; "hoc dicit", Piscator. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/47.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{f}</span> <i>As for</i> our redeemer, the LORD of hosts <i>is</i> his name, the Holy One of Israel.</span><p>(f) The Israelites will confess that the Lord does this for his Church's sake.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/47.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. The verse as it stands interrupts the continuity of the poem, especially in the view of those who hold that the speaker is throughout Jehovah. Lowth and others regard it as the response of a chorus of Israelites to the words of God in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-3.htm" title="Your nakedness shall be uncovered, yes, your shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet you as a man.">Isaiah 47:3</a></span>, while Dillmann and others unhesitatingly pronounce it to be an interpolation. But all reasonable objections are removed if we supply the word “saith” as in two Greek codices. Combining this with the other suggestion of Oort mentioned above, the last distich of the strophe reads thus:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will take vengeance and will not be entreated,—saith our Redeemer</span>;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Jehovah of Hosts is His name,—the Holy One of Israel</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As for our Redeemer</span>, etc. Mr. Cheyne suspects, with some reason, that this is "the marginal note of a sympathetic scribe, which has made its way by accident into the text." It is certainly quite unlike anything else in the song, which would artistically be improved by its removal. If, however, it be retained, we must regard it as a parenthetic ejaculation of the Jewish Church on hearing the first strophe of the song - the Church contrasting itself with Babylon, which has no one to stand up for it, whereas it has as "Redeemer the Lord of hosts, the Holy One of Israel." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/46.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The second admonition is addressed to those who would imitate the heathen. "Remember this, and become firm, take it to heart, ye rebellious ones! Remember the beginning from the olden time, that I am God, and none else: Deity, and absolutely none like me: proclaiming the issue from the beginning, and from ancient times what has not yet taken place, saying, My counsel shall stand, and all my good pleasure I carry out: calling a bird of prey from the east, the man of my counsel from a distant land: not only have I spoken, I also bring it; I have purposed it, I also execute it." The object to which "this" points back is the nothingness of idols and idolatry. The persons addressed are the &#1508;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; (those apostatizing), but, as &#1492;&#1514;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; shows, whether it mean &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5; or &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-13.htm">1 Corinthians 16:13</a>), such as have not yet actually carried out their rebellion or apostasy, but waver between Jehovahism and heathenism, and are inclined to the latter. &#1492;&#1514;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; is hardly a denom. hithpalel of &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; in the sense of "man yourselves," since &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, whether it signifies a husband or a social being, or like &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, a frail or mortal being, is at any rate equivalent to &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;, and therefore never shows the modification u. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473; (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;) signifies to be firm, strong, compact; in the piel (rabb.), to be well-grounded; nithpael, to be fortified, established; here hithpoel, "show yourselves firm" (Targ., Jer.: fundamini ne rursum subitus idololatriae vos turbo subvertat). That they may strengthen themselves in faith and fidelity, they are referred to the history of their nation; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; are not prophecies given at an earlier time - a meaning which the priora only acquire in such a connection as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-9.htm">Isaiah 43:9</a> - but former occurrences. They are to pass before their minds the earlier history, and indeed "from the olden time." "Remember:" zikhru&#772; is connected with the accusative of the object of remembrance, and &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; points to its result. An earnest and thoughtful study of history would show them that Jehovah alone was El, the absolutely Mighty One, and 'Elo&#772;h&#305;&#772;m, the Being who united in Himself all divine majesty by which reverence was evoked. The participles in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-11.htm">Isaiah 46:11</a> are attached to the "I" of &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;. It is Jehovah, the Incomparable, who has now, as at other times from the very commencement of the new turn in history, predicted the issue of which it would lead, and miqqedem, i.e., long before, predicted things that have not yet occurred, and which therefore lit outside the sphere of human combination - another passage like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-26.htm">Isaiah 41:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-21.htm">Isaiah 45:21</a>, etc., in which what is predicted in these prophecies lays claim to the character of a prediction of long standing, and not of one merely uttered a few years before. The &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;, in which the &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; are already in progress (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-9.htm">Isaiah 42:9</a>), is to be regarded as the prophet's ideal present; for Jehovah not only foretells before the appearance of Cyrus what is to be expected of him, but declares that His determination must be realized, that He will bring to pass everything upon which His will is set, and summons the man upon the stage of history as the instrument of its accomplishment, so that He knew Cyrus before he himself had either consciousness or being (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-4.htm">Isaiah 45:4-5</a>). The east is Persis (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>); and the distant land, the northern part of Media (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-5.htm">Isaiah 13:5</a>). Cyrus is called an eagle, or, strictly speaking, a bird of prey (&#8219;ayit),<p>(Note: The resemblance to &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; (&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;) is merely accidental. This name for the eagle is traceable, like avid, to a root va&#770;, to move with the swiftness of the wind. This was shown by Passow, compare Kuhn's Zeitschrift, i. 29, where we also find at 10, 126 another but less probable derivation from a root i, to go (compare eva, a course).)<p>just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-3.htm">Ezekiel 17:3</a> Nebuchadnezzar is called a nesher. According to Cyrop. vii. 1, 4, the campaign of Cyrus was &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. Instead of &#1506;&#1510;&#1514;&#1493; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, the keri reads more clearly, though quite unnecessarily, (&#1506;&#1510;&#1514;&#1497; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (see e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26</a>). The correlate &#1488;&#1507; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-11.htm">Isaiah 46:11</a>), which is only attached to the second verb the second time, affirms that Jehovah does not only the one, but the other also. His word is made by Him into a deed, His idea into a reality. &#1497;&#1510;&#1512; is a word used particularly by Isaiah, to denote the ideal preformation of the future in the mind of God (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-26.htm">Isaiah 37:26</a>). The feminine suffixes refer in a neuter sense to the theme of the prophecy - the overthrow of idolatrous Babel, upon which Cyrus comes down like an eagle, in the strength of Jehovah. So far we have the nota bene for those who are inclined to apostasy. They are to lay to heart the nothingness of the heathen gods, and, on the other hand, the self-manifestation of Jehovah from the olden time, that is to say, of the One God who is now foretelling and carrying out the destruction of the imperial city through the eagle from the east. </body></html>
