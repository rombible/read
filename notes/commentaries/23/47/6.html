She was to be degraded and endure sufferings; and is represented sitting on the ground, grinding at the handmill, the lowest and most laborious service. God was righteous in his vengeance, and none should interpose. The prophet exults in the Lord of hosts, as the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel. God often permits wicked men to prevail against his people; but those who cruelly oppress them will be punished.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/47.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I was worth with my people - In this verse and the following, a reason is assigned why God would deal so severely with her. One of the reasons was, that in executing the punishment which he had designed on the Jewish people, she had done it with pride, ambition, and severity; so that though God intended they should be punished, yet the feelings of Babylon in doing it, were such also as to deserve his decided rebuke and wrath.<p>I have polluted mine inheritance - Jerusalem and the land of Judea see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-28.htm">Isaiah 43:28</a>). He had stripped it of its glory; caused the temple and city to be destroyed; and spread desolation over the land. Though it had been done by the Chaldeans, yet it had been in accordance with his purpose, and under his direction <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-9.htm">Psalm 28:9</a>.<p>Thou didst show them no mercy - Though God had given up his people to be punished for their sins, yet this did not justify the spirit with which the Chaldeans had done it, or make proper the cruelty which they had evinced toward them. It is true that some of the Jewish captives, as, e. g., Daniel, were honored and favored in Babylon. It is not improbable that the circumstances of many of them were comparatively easy while there, and that they acquired possessions and formed attachments there which made them unwilling to leave that land when Cyrus permitted them to return to their own country. But it is also true, that Nebuchadnezzar showed them no compassion when he destroyed the temple and city, that the mass of them were treated with great indignity and cruelty in Babylon. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/137-1.htm">Psalm 137:1-3</a>, where they pathetically and beautifully record their sufferings:<p>By the rivers of Babylon there we sat down,<p>Yea, we wept when we remembered Zion.<p>For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song;<p>And they that wasted us rcquired of us mirth.<p>Saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.<p>Thus also Jeremiah Jer 1:17 describes the cruelty of their conquerors: 'Israel is a scattered sheep - the lions have driven him away; this Nebuchadnezzar hath broken his bones' (see also <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-5.htm">2 Kings 25:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-6.htm">2 Kings 25:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-27.htm">2 Kings 25:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-34.htm">Jeremiah 51:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-16.htm">Lamentations 4:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-11.htm">Lamentations 5:11-14</a>).<p>Upon the ancient - That is, upon the old man. The idea is, that they had oppressed, and reduced to hard servitude, those who were venerable by years, and by experience. To treat the aged with veneration is everywhere in the Scriptures regarded as an important and sacred duty <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-32.htm">Leviticus 19:32</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/32-4.htm">Job 32:4-6</a>; and to disregard age, and pour contempt on hoary hairs, is everywhere spoken of as a crime of an aggravated nature (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-23.htm">2 Kings 2:23-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-17.htm">Proverbs 30:17</a>). That the Chaldeans had thus disregarded age and rank, is a frequent subject of complaint among the sacred writers:<p>They respected not the persons of the priests,<p>They favored not the elders.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/47.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. reason for God's vengeance on Babylon: in executing God's will against His people, she had done so with wanton cruelty (Isa 10:5, &c.; Jer 50:17; 51:33; Zec 1:15).<p>polluted my inheritance&#8212;(Isa 43:28).<p>the ancient&#8212;Even old age was disregarded by the Chaldeans, who treated all alike with cruelty (La 4:16; 5:12) [Rosenmuller]. Or, "the ancient" means Israel, worn out with calamities in the latter period of its history (Isa 46:4), as its earlier stage of history is called its "youth" (Isa 54:6; Eze 16:60).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/47.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I have polluted mine inheritance; </span> I cast them away as an unclean thing; I stained their glory; I removed them from the Holy Land, and from the place of my presence and worship, which alone made them a holy and peculiar people; I banished them into a polluted land, amongst uncircumcised and unclean persons, by whom they were many ways defiled; I rejected them from being my people, and so were in my sight no better than the rest of the heathen nations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Given them into thine hand, </span> to punish them, and deal with them as thou sawest fit. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thou didst show them no mercy; </span> thou hast exceeded the bounds of thy commission, and instead of that compassion which humanity teacheth men to show to such as are in misery, thou didst add to their afflictions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid the yoke; </span> who besides their common calamity were afflicted with the miseries of old age, and therefore did require both pity and reverence. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/47.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I was wroth with my people,....

Jehovah speaks, charging Babylon with pitiless inhumanity towards His people when they were delivered to her for chastisement (for the thought cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-15.htm" title="And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.">Zechariah 1:15</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I was wroth with my people</span>] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-9.htm" title="For this is as the waters of Noah to me: for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with you, nor rebuke you.">Isaiah 54:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-16.htm" title="For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.">Isaiah 57:16</a> f., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-5.htm" title="You meet him that rejoices and works righteousness, those that remember you in your ways: behold, you are wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.">Isaiah 64:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-9.htm" title="Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech you, we are all your people.">Isaiah 64:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I have polluted</span> (R.V. <span class="bld">I profaned</span>) <span class="ital">mine inheritance</span>] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-28.htm" title="Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.">Isaiah 43:28</a>. “Profane” is the opposite of “holy;” as “holy to Jehovah” Israel was inviolable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-3.htm" title="Israel was holiness to the LORD, and the first fruits of his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come on them, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 2:3</a>), but when this relation ceased she passed under the power of the heathen.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">upon the ancient</span>] Better, as R.V.: <span class="bld">upon the aged</span>. Although the word is sing., there can be no doubt that it is used literally of the old men on whom the hardships of captivity fell most heavily (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-16.htm" title="The anger of the LORD has divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favored not the elders.">Lamentations 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-12.htm" title="Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honored.">Lamentations 5:12</a>). The idea that Israel as a nation is meant is not to be entertained (see on ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-4.htm" title="And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you.">Isaiah 46:4</a>). We have little knowledge of the circumstances of the Israelites in exile, but there is nothing improbable in the supposition that some of them were put to forced labour, and that cases of exceptional barbarity may have occurred.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I was wroth with my people</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-3.htm">2 Kings 24:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13-17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I have polluted...  and given</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I polluted and gave.</span> The reference is to the conquest of Judaea by Nebuchadnezzar. <span class="cmt_word">Thou didst show them no mercy.</span> We have very little <span class="accented">historical</span> knowledge of the general treatment of the Jewish exiles during the Captivity. A certain small number - Daniel and the Three Children - were advanced to positions of importance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-19.htm">Daniel 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-48.htm">Daniel 2:48, 49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-30.htm">Daniel 3:30</a>), and, on the whole, well treated. On the other hand, Jehoiachin underwent an imprisonment of thirty-seven years' duration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-27.htm">2 Kings 25:27</a>). Mr. Cheyne says that "the writings of Jeremiah and Ezekiel do not suggest that the [bulk of the] exiles were great sufferers." This is, no doubt, true; and we may, perhaps, regard Isaiah's words in this place as sufficiently made good by the "cruelties which disfigured the first days of the Babylonian triumph" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-16.htm">Lamentations 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-12.htm">Lamentations 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-17.htm">2 Chronicles 36:17</a>). Still, there may well have been a large amount of suffering among the rank-and-file of the captives, of which no historic record has come down to us. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/138.htm">Psalm 138</a>. reveals some of the bitter feelings of the exiles. <span class="cmt_word">Upon the ancient</span>; rather, <span class="accented">upon the aged.</span> The author of Chronicles notes that Nebuchadnezzar, on taking Jerusalem, "had no compassion on young man or maiden, old man or him that stooped for age" (<span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>).

"Hearken to me, ye strong-hearted, that are far from righteousness! I have brought my righteousness near; it is not far off, and my salvation tarrieth not: and I give salvation in Zion, my glory to Israel." All that is called in Hellenic and Hellenistic &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, is comprehended in &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;; and everything by which ba&#770;sa&#770;r and nephesh are affected comes into the light of consciousness in the heart (Psychol. p. 251). According to this biblico-psychological idea, &#1500;&#1489; &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; may signify either the courageous (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-6.htm">Psalm 76:6</a>), or, as in this instance, the strong-minded; but as a synonym of &#1500;&#1489; &#1505;&#1492;&#1494;&#1511;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-4.htm">Ezekiel 2:4</a>) and &#1500;&#1489; &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-7.htm">Ezekiel 3:7</a>), viz., in the sense of those who resist the impressions of the work and grace of God in their consciousness of mental superiority to anything of the kind, and not in the sense of those who have great mental endowments. These are "far from righteousness" (tseda&#770;qa&#770;h), that is to say, they have despaired of the true, loving fidelity of Jehovah, and have no wish for any further knowledge of it. Therefore they shall hear, and possibly not without impression, that this loving fidelity is about to manifest itself, and salvation is about to be realized. Jehovah has given salvation in Zion, that is to say, is giving it even now, so that it will become once more the centre of the renovated nation, and impart its glory to this, so that it may shine in the splendour bestowed upon it by its God. We have here the side of light and love, turned towards us by the two-faced tseda&#770;qa&#770;h, as a parallel word to theshu&#772;&#8219;a&#770;h, or salvation. With this admonition to the indifferent and careless, to whom the salvation of which they have given up all hope is proclaimed as at the door, this prophecy is brought to a close. In three distinct stages, commencing with "hearken," "remember," "hearken," it has unfolded the spiritual influences which the fact declared in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-2.htm">Isaiah 46:2</a> ought to have upon Israel, and resembles a pastoral sermon in its tone. </body></html>
