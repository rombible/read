Tyre being destroyed and laid waste, the merchants should abandon her. Flee to shift for thine own safety; but those that are uneasy in one place, will be so in another; for when God's judgments pursue sinners, they will overtake them. Whence shall all this trouble come? It is a destruction from the Almighty. God designed to convince men of the vanity and uncertainty of all earthly glory. Let the ruin of Tyre warn all places and persons to take heed of pride; for he who exalts himself shall be abased.

Sidon is here addressed as the mother of Tyre, and is called on to lament over her daughter that was destroyed. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-12.htm">Isaiah 23:12</a>, Tyre is called the 'daughter of Sidon;' and such appellations were commonly given to cities (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>). Sidon is here represented as ashamed, or grieved - as a mother is who is bereft of all her children.<p>The sea hath spoken - New Tyre was on a rock at some distance from the land, and seemed to rise out of the sea, somewhat as Venice does It is described here as a production of the sea, and the sea is represented as speaking by her.<p>Even the strength of the sea - The fortress, or strong place (&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494;  ma&#772;&#8219;o&#770;z) of the sea. Tyre, on a rock, might be regarded as the strong place, or the defense of the Mediterranean. Thus Zechariah Zechariah 9:3 says of it. 'And Tyrus did build herself a stronghold' (&#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1512;  ma&#770;tso&#770;r).<p>Saying, I travail not - The expresssions which follow are to be regarded as the language of Tyre - the founder of colonies and cities. The sense is, 'My wealth and resources are gone. My commerce is annihilated. I cease to plant cities and colonies, and to nourish and foster them, as I once did, by my trade.' The idea of the whole verse is, that the city which had been the mistress of the commercial world, and distinguished for founding other cities and colonies, was about to lose her importance, and to cease to extend her colonies and her influence over other countries. Over this fact, Sidon, the mother and founder of Tyre herself, would be humbled and grieved that her daughter, so proud, so rich, and so magnificent, was brought so low. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. Zidon&#8212;called on, as being the parent country of Tyre (Isa 23:12), and here equivalent to Phœnicia in general, to feel the shame (as it was esteemed in the East) of being now as childless as if she never had any. "I (no more now) travail, nor bring forth," &c. "Strength of the sea," that is, stronghold, namely, New Tyre, on a rock (as "Tyre" means) surrounded by the sea (Eze 26:4, 14-17; so Venice was called "Bride of the sea"; Zec 9:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Be thou ashamed, O Zidon; </span> for Zidon was a great city near Tyre, and strongly united to her by commerce and league, and called by some the mother of Tyre, which they say was built and first inhabited by a colony of the Sidonians; and therefore she must needs be greatly concerned in the destruction of Tyrus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The sea; </span> that part of the sea in which Tyrus was, and from which ships and men were sent into all countries. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The strength of the sea:</span> this is added to explain what he meant by the sea, even Tyrus, who might be called <span class="ital">the strength of the sea</span>, either actively, because it defended that part of the sea from piracies and injuries; or passively, because it was defended and strengthened by the sea, which encompassed it.

A city near to Tyre, about twenty five miles from it; Jarchi says it was within a day's walk of it; these two cities, as they were near to each other, so they were closely allied together, and traded much with one another, so that the fall of Tyre must be distressing and confounding to Zidon; and besides, Tyre was a colony of the Zidonians, and therefore, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-12.htm">Isaiah 23:12</a>, is called the daughter of Zidon, and could not but be affected with its ruin, and the more, as it might fear the same would soon be its case: <p>for the sea hath spoken; which washed the city of Tyre; or those that sailed in it; or rather Tyre itself, so called because its situation was by the sea, the island was encompassed with it: <p>even the strength of the sea; which was enriched by what was brought by sea to it, and was strengthened by it, being surrounded with the waters of it as with a wall, and had the sovereignty over it: <p>saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins; either the sea itself, which now no more brought great numbers of young people to Tyre, children to be educated, young men to be instructed in trade and business, and virgins to be given in marriage, the city being destroyed; or Tyre, which before was very populous, full of children, young men, and maidens, but now desolate; and which formerly sent out colonies abroad, and was a mother city to many, as Pliny says (s); it was famous for the birth of many cities, as Lepti, Utica, Carthage, and Gades or Cales; but now it was all over with her.

"And it will come to pass in that day, that I call to my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and invest him with thy coat, and I throw thy sash firmly round him, and place they government in his hand; and he will become a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. And I place the key of David upon his shoulder: and when he opens, no man shuts; and when he shuts, no man opens. And I fasten him as a plug in a fast place, and he becomes the seat of honour to his father's house. And the whole mass of his father's house hangs upon him, the offshoots and side-shoots, every small vessel, from the vessel of the basins even to every vessel of the pitchers." Eliakim is called the "servant of Jehovah," as one who was already a servant of God in his heart and conduct; the official service is added for the first time here. This title of honour generally embraces both kinds of service (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3</a>). It is quite in accordance with oriental custom, that this transfer of the office is effected by means of investiture (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-19.htm">1 Kings 19:19</a>): chizze&#772;k, with a double accusative, viz., that of the person and that of the official girdle, is used here according to its radical signification, in the sense of girding tightly or girding round, putting the girdle round him so as to cause the whole dress to sit firmly, without hanging loose. The word memshalteka&#770; (thy government) shows how very closely the office forfeited by Shebna was connected with that of the king. This is also proved by the word "father," which is applied in other cases to the king as the father of the land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-5.htm">Isaiah 9:5</a>). The "key" signifies the power of the keys; and for this reason it is not given into Eliakim's hand, but placed upon his shoulder (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-5.htm">Isaiah 9:5</a>). This key was properly handled by the king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a>), and therefore by the "house-mayor" only in his stead. The power of the keys consisted not only in the supervision of the royal chambers, but also in the decision who was and who was not to be received into the king's service. There is a resemblance, therefore, to the giving of the keys of the kingdom of heaven to Peter under the New Testament. But there the "binding" and "loosing" introduce another figure, though one similar in sense; whereas here, in the "opening" and "shutting," the figure of the key is retained. The comparison of the institution of Eliakim in his office to the fastening of a tent-peg was all the more natural, that ya&#770;the&#772;d was also used as a general designation for national rulers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-4.htm">Zechariah 10:4</a>), who stand in the same relation to the commonwealth as a tent-peg to the tent which it holds firmly and keeps upright. As the tent-peg is rammed into the ground, so that a person could easily sit upon it, the figure is changed, and the tent-peg becomes a seat of honour. As a splendid chair is an ornament to a room, so Eliakim would be an honour to his hitherto undistinguished family. The thought that naturally suggests itself - namely, that the members of the family would sit upon this chair, for the purpose of raising themselves to honour - is expressed by a different figure. Eliakim is once more depicted as a ya&#770;thed, but it is as a still higher one this time - namely, as the rod of a wardrobe, or a peg driven high up into the wall. Upon this rod or peg they hang (tha&#770;lu, i.e., one hangs, or there hangs) all the ca&#770;bo&#772;d of the house of Eliakim, i.e., not every one who wished to be honoured and attained to honour in this way (cf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-13.htm">Isaiah 5:13</a>), but the whole weight of his family (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>). This family is then subdivided into its separate parts, and, as we may infer from the juxtaposition of the masculine and feminine nouns, according to its male and female constituents. In &#1510;&#1488;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; (offshoots) and &#1510;&#1508;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; ("side-shoots," from &#1510;&#1508;&#1506;, to push out; compare &#1510;&#1508;&#1497;&#1506;, dung, with &#1510;&#1488;&#1492;, mire) there is contained the idea of a widely ramifying and undistinguished family connection. The numerous rabble consisted of nothing but vessels of a small kind (hakka&#770;ta&#770;n), at the best of basons (agga&#770;noth) like those used by the priests for the blood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-6.htm">Exodus 24:6</a>), or in the house for mixing wine (Sol 7:3; Aram. aggono, Ar. igga&#770;ne, inga&#770;n, a washing bason), but chiefly of neba&#770;lim, i.e., leather bottles or earthenware pitchers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-14.htm">Isaiah 30:14</a>). The whole of this large but hitherto ignoble family of relations would fasten upon Eliakim, and climb through him to honour. Thus all at once the prophecy, which seemed so full of promise of Eliakim, assumes a satirical tone. We get an impression of the favouring of nephews and cousins, and cannot help asking how this could be a suitable prophecy for Shebna to hear. </body></html>
