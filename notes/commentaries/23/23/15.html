It seems better, however, with Cheyne, to take it as a symbolic number for a long period of indefinite duration, and so, bringing it into closer connection with the context, to reckon the period from its conquest by the Assyrians.<p><span class= "bld">According to the days of one king.</span>—We look in vain for any ruler of Assyria or Babylon whose reign was of this length, and the words probably mean, <span class= "ital">as the days fixed by a king</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>by a despotic and absolute decree.

The prophet foretels, 1st, “That God would circumscribe within certain bounds his severity to Tyre, and within seventy years restore it to its former state;” and, 2d, “That in process of time the Tyrians should be converted to the true religion,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-18.htm" title="And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the LORD: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the LORD, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.">Isaiah 23:18</a>.

So long the nations were to groan under that tyrannical yoke, though these nations were subdued, some sooner, some later than others, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/25-11.htm" title="And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years....">Jeremiah 25:11-12</a>. Accordingly, at the end of seventy years, Cyrus and the Persians subverted the Babylonian empire, and restored the conquered nations to their liberty.” The bishop observes further, that these seventy years may also be computed after another manner. “Tyre was taken by Nebuchadnezzar in the thirty-second year of his reign, and in the five hundred and seventy-third before Christ. Seventy years from thence will bring us down to the year five hundred and three before Christ, and the nineteenth of Darius Hystaspis. At that time, it appears from history that the Ionians had rebelled against Darius, and the Phenicians assisted him with their fleets: and, consequently, it is reasonable to conclude that they were now restored to their former privileges. In the succeeding reign we find that they, together with the Sidonians, furnished Xerxes with several ships for his expedition into Greece. And, by the time of Alexander, the Tyrians were grown to such power and greatness that they stopped the progress of that rapid conqueror longer than any part of the Persian empire besides. But this is to be understood of the insular Tyre; for, as the old city flourished most before the time of Nebuchadnezzar, so the new city flourished most afterward, and this is the Tyre that henceforth is so much celebrated in history.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:15-18 The desolations of Tyre were not to be for ever. The Lord will visit Tyre in mercy. But when set at liberty, she will use her old arts of temptation. The love of worldly wealth is spiritual idolatry; and covetousness is spiritual idolatry. This directs those that have wealth, to use it in the service of God. When we abide with God in our worldly callings, when we do all in our power to further the gospel, then our merchandise and hire are holiness to the Lord, if we look to his glory. Christians should carry on business as God's servants, and use riches as his stewards.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Tyre shall be forgotten - Shall cease to be a place of importance in commerce; shall be unheard of in those distant places to which ships formerly sailed.<p>Seventy years, according to the days of one king - 'That is, of one kingdom (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-17.htm">Daniel 7:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20</a>).' (Lowth) The word 'king' may denote dynasty, or kingdom. The duration of the Babylonian monarchy was properly but seventy years. Nebuchadnezzar began his conquest in the first year of his reign, and from thence to the taking of Babylon by Cyrus was seventy years. And at that time the nations that had been conquered and subdued by the Babylonians would be restored to liberty. Tyre was, indeed, taken toward the middle of that period, and its subjugation referred to here was only for the remaining part of it. 'All these nations,' says Jeremiah Jer 25:11, 'shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.' Some of them were conquered sooner, and some later; but the end of this period was the common time of deliverance to them all. So Lowth, Newton, Vitringa, Aben Ezra, Rosenmuller, and others, understand this. That 'the days at one king' may denote here kingdom or dynasty, and be applied to the duration of the kingdom of Babylon, is apparent from two considerations, namely,<p>(1) The word 'king' must be so understood in several places in the Scriptures; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-17.htm">Daniel 7:17</a> : 'These great beasts which are four, are four great kings which shall arise out of the earth,' that is, dynasties, or succession of kings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20</a>; so <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-12.htm">Revelation 17:12</a>).<p>(2) The expression is especially applicable to the Babylonian monarchy, because, during the entire seventy years which that kingdom lasted, it was under the dominion of one family or dynasty. Nebuchadnezzar founded the Babylonian empire, or raised it to so great splendor, that he was regarded as its founder, and was succeeded in the kingdom by his son Evil-Merodach, and his grandson Belshazzar, in whose reign the kingdom terminated; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-7.htm">Jeremiah 27:7</a> : 'And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son.' The period of seventy years is several times mentioned, as a period during which the nations that were subject to Babylon would be oppressed, and after that they should be set at liberty (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-26.htm">Jeremiah 46:26</a>).<p>Shall Tyre sing as an harlot - Margin, as the Hebrew, 'It shall be unto Tyre as the song of an harlot.' That is, Tyre shall be restored to its former state of prosperity and opulence; it shall be adorned with the rich productions of other climes, and shall be happy and joyful again. There are two ideas here; one that Tyre would be again prosperous, and the other that she would sustain substantially the same character as before. It was common to compare cities with females, whether virtuous or otherwise (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>). The same figure which is used here occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-3.htm">Revelation 17:3-19</a> (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-4.htm">Nahum 3:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-3.htm">Revelation 18:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-9.htm">Revelation 18:9</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. forgotten&#8212;Having lost its former renown, Tyre shall be in obscurity.<p>seventy years&#8212;(so Jer 25:11, 12; 29:10).<p>days of one king&#8212;that is, a dynasty. The Babylonian monarchy lasted properly but seventy years. From the first year of Nebuchadnezzar to the taking of Babylon, by Cyrus, was seventy years; then the subjected nations would be restored to liberty. Tyre was taken in the middle of that period, but it is classed in common with the rest, some conquered sooner and others later, all, however, alike to be delivered at the end of the period. So "king" is used for dynasty (Da 7:17; 8:20): Nebuchadnezzar, his son Evil-merodach, and his grandson, Belshazzar, formed the whole dynasty (Jer 25:11, 12; 27:7; 29:10).<p>shall Tyre sing as &#8230; harlot&#8212;It shall be to Tyre as the song of the harlot, namely, a harlot that has been forgotten, but who attracts notice again by her song. Large marts of commerce are often compared to harlots seeking many lovers, that is, they court merchants of all nations, and admit any one for the sake of gain (Na 3:4; Re 18:3). Covetousness is closely akin to idolatry and licentiousness, as the connection (Eph 5:5; Col 3:5) proves (compare Isa 2:6-8, 16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Forgotten; </span> neglected and forsaken by those who used to resort thither. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Seventy years; </span> during the whole time of the Jewish captivity in Babylon.

Jarchi is of opinion King David is meant, whose age was seventy years, though he is at a loss to give a reason for this his opinion; but Kimchi suggests one, and that is, the covenant which was between Hiram king of Tyre and David; and this is mentioned to put the Tyrians in mind of the breach of it, which had brought desolation upon them; some understand this of the King Messiah (i): <p>after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot; being rebuilt and restored to its former state; as a harlot who has been cast off by her lovers, on account of some disease she has laboured under, and through a dislike of her; but, having recovered her health, makes use of her arts, and this among others, to sing a song, in order to draw, by her melodious voice, her lovers to her again; and so Tyre being built again, and out of the hands of its oppressors, and restored to its former liberty, should make use of all arts and methods to recover her trade, and draw merchants from all parts to her again. <p>(i) T.

The number occurs frequently in the later literature: <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-12.htm" title="Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which you have had indignation these three score and ten years?">Zechariah 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-5.htm" title="Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did you at all fast to me, even to me?">Zechariah 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-2.htm" title="In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.">Daniel 9:2</a> ff.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-21.htm" title="To fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfill three score and ten years.">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>. It is to be noted that in all these cases there is a reference more or less explicit to Jeremiah’s prediction; and the use of the number here is probably to be accounted for in the same way. Ezekiel had used the number “forty” in a precisely similar manner (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-6.htm" title="And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.">Isaiah 4:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-13.htm" title="Why the Lord said, For as much as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:">Isaiah 29:13</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">according to the days of one king</span>] The meaning is uncertain.

After an interval, expressed by the symbolic number of" <span class="accented">seventy</span> years," Tyre is to rise from her ashes, and become once more a prosperous state, resuming her former occupation of a "merchant city," and once more making great gains, which she will devote to the service of Jehovah. St. Jerome thought that this prophecy had not been accomplished in his day. If so, it cannot be said to have been accomplished yet; unless, indeed, Tyre may be regarded as representing the commercial spirit, which. under Christianity, is not necessarily alien from religion, but shows itself sometimes altogether friendly to the Church, supplying ways and means for ten thousand  philanthropic and praiseworthy enterprises (ver. 18). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tyro shall be forgotten</span>; i.e. "shall cease to occupy men's thoughts, as a factor in politics - shall pass out of their calculations, and count for nothing." <span class="cmt_word">Seventy years</span>. "Forty years" and "seventy years" are the chief representatives in Scripture of an indefinite time. The week of creation seems to have given to seven its quasi-sacred character, which passed from the primary number to the corresponding decimal one. The sacred use of "seventy" appears first in the "seventy elders" who accompanied Moses to the covenant-feast on Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-9.htm">Exodus 24:9</a>). After this, "seventy 'talents are mentioned as the weight of the bronze offerings for the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-29.htm">Exodus 38:29</a>), and "seventy" shekels as the weight of the silver bowls offered by the heads of tribes when the tabernacle was set up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-13.htm">Numbers 7:13-85</a>). The "indefinite" us, of "seventy" is most apparent in such expressions as that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-24.htm">Genesis 4:24</a>, "If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, surely Lamech <span class="accented">seventy</span> and sevenfold;" and that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-22.htm">Matthew 18:22</a>, "I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until <span class="accented">seventy</span> times seven." "Seventy" seems also to be indefinite in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-27.htm">Exodus 15:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-9.htm">Numbers 33:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-7.htm">Judges 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-13.htm">Judges 12:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-15.htm">2 Samuel 24:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-15.htm">1 Kings 5:15</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-14.htm">1 Chronicles 21:14</a>, etc. It is absurd to count the "seventy years" of the present passage, as some do, from the accession of Nebuchadnezzar to the death of Nabonidus, for neither did Tyro begin to be forgotten in the first year of the one prince, nor did she immediately recover herself on the death of the other. <span class="cmt_word">According to the days of one king</span>; or, <span class="accented">like the days of one king</span>.

"Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the coast! Is this your fate, thou full of rejoicing, whose origin is from the days of the olden time, whom her feet carried far away to settle? Who hath determined such a thing concerning Tzor, the distributor of crowns, whose merchants are princes, whose traders are the chief men of the earth? Jehovah of hosts hath determined it, to desecrate the pomp of every kind of ornament, to dishonour the chief men of the earth, all of them." The exclamation "howl ye" (he&#772;illu) implies their right to give themselves up to their pain. In other cases complaint is unmanly, but here it is justifiable (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-4.htm">Isaiah 15:4</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-7.htm">Isaiah 23:7</a> the question arises, whether &#8219;alliza&#770;h is a nominative predicate, as is generally assumed ("Is this, this deserted heap of ruins, your formerly rejoicing city?"), or a vocative. We prefer the latter, because there is nothing astonishing in the omission of the article in this case (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-2.htm">Isaiah 22:2</a>; Ewald, 327, a); whereas in the former case, although it is certainly admissible (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-13.htm">Isaiah 32:13</a>), it is very harsh (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-16.htm">Isaiah 14:16</a>), and the whole expression a very doubtful one to convey the sense of &#1500;&#1499;&#1501; &#1488;&#1513;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1494;&#1492; &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; &#1492;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514;. To &#8219;alliza&#770;h there is attached the descriptive, attributive clause: whose origin (kadma&#770;h, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-55.htm">Ezekiel 16:55</a>) dates from the days of the olden time; and then a second "whose feet brought her far away (raglaim construed as a masculine, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-16.htm">Jeremiah 13:16</a>, for example) to dwell in a foreign land. This is generally understood as signifying transportation by force into an enemy's country. But Luzzatto very properly objects to this, partly on the ground that &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; &#1497;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; (her feet carried her) is the strongest expression that can be used for voluntary emigration, to which la&#770;gu&#772;r (to settle) also corresponds; and partly because we miss the antithetical &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, which we should expect with this interpretation. The reference is to the trading journeys which extended "far away" (whether by land or sea), and to the colonies, i.e., the settlements founded in those distant places, that leading characteristic of the Tyro-Phoenician people (this is expressed in the imperfect by yobilua&#770;h, quam portabant; gur is the most appropriate word to apply to such settlements: for me&#772;ra&#770;cho&#772;k, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>). Sidon was no doubt older than Tyre, but Tyre was also of primeval antiquity. Strabo speaks of its as the oldest Phoenician city "after Sidon;" Curtius calls it vetustate originis insignis; and Josephus reckons the time from the founding of Tyre to the building of Solomon's temple as 240 years (Ant. viii. 3, 1; compare Herod. ii. 44). Tyre is called hammae&#772;atira&#770;h, not as wearing a crown (Vulg. quondam coronata), but as a distributor of crowns (Targum). Either would be suitable as a matter of fact; but the latter answers better to the hiphil (as hikr&#305;&#772;n, hiphr&#305;&#772;s, which are expressive of results produced from within outwards, can hardly be brought into comparison). Such colonies as Citium, Tartessus, and at first Carthage, were governed by kings appointed by the mother city, and dependent upon her. Her merchants were princes (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-8.htm">Isaiah 10:8</a>), the most honoured of the earth; &#1504;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; acquires a superlative meaning from the genitive connection (Ges. 119, 2). From the fact that the Phoenicians had the commerce of the world in their hands, a merchant was called cena&#8219;ani or cena&#8219;an (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-8.htm">Hosea 12:8</a>; from the latter, not from cin&#8219;a&#770;ni, the plural cin&#8219;a&#770;nim which we find here is formed), and the merchandise cin&#8219;a&#770;h. The verb chille&#772;l, to desecrate or profane, in connection with the "pomp of every kind of ornament," leads us to think more especially of the holy places of both insular and continental Tyre, among which the temple of Melkarth in the new city of the former was the most prominent (according to the Arrian, Anab. ii. 16, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c9;&#788;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;). These glories, which were thought so inviolable, Jehovah will profane. "To dishonour the chief men:" leha&#770;ke&#772;l (ad ignominiam deducere, Vulg.) as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-22.htm">Isaiah 8:22</a>. </body></html>
