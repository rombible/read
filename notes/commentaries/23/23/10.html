She was noted for mirth and diversions; and this made her loth to consider the warnings God gave by his servants. Her merchants were princes, and lived like princes. Tyre being destroyed and laid waste, the merchants should abandon her. Flee to shift for thine own safety; but those that are uneasy in one place, will be so in another; for when God's judgments pursue sinners, they will overtake them. Whence shall all this trouble come? It is a destruction from the Almighty. God designed to convince men of the vanity and uncertainty of all earthly glory. Let the ruin of Tyre warn all places and persons to take heed of pride; for he who exalts himself shall be abased.

Vitringa supposes that it means that all that held the city together - its fortifications, walls, etc., would be laid waste, and that as a river flows on without obstruction, so the inhabitants would be scattered far and near. Everything, says he, would be leveled, and the field would not be distinguishable from the city. Grotius thus renders it: 'Pass to some one of thy colonies; as a river flows from the fountain to the sea, so do you go to the ocean.' Lowth understands it also as relating to the time of the destruction of Tyre, and to the escape which the inhabitants would then make.<p>'Overflow thy land like a river,<p>O daughter of Tarshish; the mound (that kept in thy waters)<p>Is no more.'<p>The Septuagint renders it, 'Cultivate (&#x395;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  Ergazon) thy land, for the ships shall no more come from Carthage' (&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  Karche&#772;donos) Probably the true meaning is that which refers it to the time of the siege, and to the fact that the inhabitants would seek other places when their defense was destroyed. That is, 'Pass through thy territories, thy dependent cities, states, colonies, and seek a refuge there; or wander there like a flowing stream.'<p>As a river - Perhaps the allusion is to the Nile, as the word &#1497;&#1488;&#1512;  ye'or is usually given to the Nile; or it may be to any river that flows on with a mighty current when all obstructions are removed. The idea is, that as waters flow on when the barriers are removed, so the inhabitants of Tyre would pour forth from their city. The idea is not so much that of rapidity, as it is they should go like a stream that has no dikes, barriers, or obstacles now to confine its flowing waters.<p>O daughter of Tarshish - Tyre; so called either because it was in some degree sustained and supplied by the commerce of Tarshish; or because its inhabitants would become the inhabitants of Tarshish, and it is so called by anticipation. The Vulgate renders this, "Filia marias" - 'Daughter of the sea. Juntos supposes that the prophet addresses those who were then in the city who were natives of Tarshish, and exhorts them to flee for safety to their own city.<p>There is no more strength - Margin, 'Girdle.' The word &#1502;&#1494;&#1495;  me&#772;zach means properly a girdle <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-31.htm">Job 12:31</a>. It is applied to that which binds or secures the body; and may be applied here perhaps to that which secured or bound the city of Tyre; that is, its fortifications, its walls, its defenses. They would all be leveled; and nothing would secure the inhabitants, as they would flow forth as waters that are pent up do, when every barrier is removed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. a river&#8212;Hebrew, "the river," namely, Nile.<p>daughter of Tarshish&#8212;Tyre and its inhabitants (Isa 1:8), about henceforth, owing to the ruin of Tyre, to become inhabitants of its colony, Tartessus: they would pour forth from Tyre, as waters flow on when the barriers are removed [Lowth]. Rather, Tarshish, or Tartessus and its inhabitants, as the phrase usually means: they had been kept in hard bondage, working in silver and lead mines near Tarshish, by the parent city (Eze 26:17): but now "the bond of restraint" (for so "strength," Margin, "girdle," that is, bond, Ps 2:3, ought to be translated) is removed, since Tyre is no more.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/isaiah/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Pass through the land; </span> tarry no longer in thy own territories, but flee through them, and beyond them, into other countries, for safety and relief. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As a river; </span> swiftly, lest you be prevented; and continually, till you be all gone; and in shoals and multitudes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">O daughter of Tarshish; </span> O Tyrus; for of her he speaks both in the foregoing and following words.

Or, "of the sea", as the Vulgate Latin; meaning Tyre, which was situated in the sea, and did, as it were, spring from it, and was fortified by it, and supported by ships of merchandise on it, from various places; but now, being about to be destroyed, the inhabitants of it are called upon to pass through it, and get out of it as fast as they could, even as swiftly as a river runs, and in great abundance or multitudes. Kimchi thinks the Tyrians are bid to pass to the daughter of Tarshish, that is, to Tarshish itself, to make their escape out of their own land, and flee thither for safety; this the accents will not admit of, there being an "athnach" upon the word "river"; rather the merchants of Tarshish, that were in Tyre, are exhorted to depart to their own land with all possible haste, lest they should be involved in its ruin; though the Targum inclines to the other sense, <p>"pass out of thy land, as the waters of a river flee to a province of the sea:'' <p>there is no more strength; in Tyre, to defend themselves against the enemy, to protect their trade, and the merchants that traded with them; or, "no more girdle" (e); about it; no more girt about with walls, ramparts, and other fortifications, or with soldiers and shipping, or with the sea, with which it was encompassed, while an island, but now no more, being joined to the continent by the enemy. Some think, because girdles were a part of merchandise, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-24.htm">Proverbs 31:24</a>, that this is said to express the meanness and poverty of the place, that there was not so much as a girdle left in it; rather that it was stripped of its power and authority, of which the girdle was a sign; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-21.htm">Isaiah 22:21</a>. <p>(e)   "nulla est zona amplius", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; "non est cingulum amplius", Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Pass through thy land as a river, O <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> daughter of Tarshish: <i>there is</i> no more strength.</span><p>(n) Your strength will no more serve you: therefore flee to other countries for comfort.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/23.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">as a river</span>] Rather: <span class="bld">as the Nile</span> (as R.V.).

But nowhere else is a man represented as hampered by his own girdle; the removal of it is rather a synonym for weakness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-21.htm" title="He pours contempt on princes, and weakens the strength of the mighty.">Job 12:21</a>—the same root as here—cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-27.htm" title="None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the lace of their shoes be broken:">Isaiah 5:27</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">10–14</span>. The third strophe, as usually explained, deals mainly with the emancipation of the Phœnician colonies from the somewhat stringent control of Tyre.

The sea, or more closely considered, the fortress of the sea, i.e., the rock-island on which Neo-tyrus stood with its strong and lofty houses, lifts up its voice in lamentation. Sidon, the ancestress of Canaan, must hear with overwhelming shame how Tyre mourns the loss of her daughters, and complains that, robbed as she has been of her children, she is like a barren women. For the war to have murdered her young men and maidens, was exactly the same as if she had never given birth to them or brought them up. Who is there that does not recognise in this the language of Isaiah (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>)? - Even in Egypt the fate of Phoenicia produces alarm. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-5.htm">Isaiah 23:5</a> "When the report cometh to Egypt, they tremble at the report from Tzor." In the protasis (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-5.htm">Isaiah 23:5</a>) lemitzraim (to Egypt) the verb "cometh" is implied; the Caph in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-5.htm">Isaiah 23:5</a> signifies simultaneousness, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-4.htm">Isaiah 18:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-19.htm">Isaiah 30:19</a> (Ges. Thes. p. 650). The news of the fall of Tyre spreads universal terror in Egypt, because its own prosperity depended upon Tyre, which was the great market for its corn; and when such a bulwark had fallen, a similar fate awaited itself. </body></html>
