She was noted for mirth and diversions; and this made her loth to consider the warnings God gave by his servants. Her merchants were princes, and lived like princes. Tyre being destroyed and laid waste, the merchants should abandon her. Flee to shift for thine own safety; but those that are uneasy in one place, will be so in another; for when God's judgments pursue sinners, they will overtake them. Whence shall all this trouble come? It is a destruction from the Almighty. God designed to convince men of the vanity and uncertainty of all earthly glory. Let the ruin of Tyre warn all places and persons to take heed of pride; for he who exalts himself shall be abased. God will do it, who has all power in his hand; but the Chaldeans shall be the instruments.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who hath taken this counsel? - To whom is this to be traced? Is this the work of man, or is it the plan of God? - questions which would naturally arise at the contemplation of the ruin of a city so ancient and so magnificent. The object of this question is to trace it all to God; and this perhaps indicates the scope of the prophecy - to show that God reigns, and does all his pleasure ever cities and kingdoms.<p>The crowning city - The distributer of crowns; or the city from which dependent towns, provinces, and kingdoms had arisen. Many colonies and cities had been founded by Tyre. Tartessus in Spain, Citium in Cyprus, Carthage in Africa, and probably many other places were Phenician colonies, and derived their origin from Tyre, and were still its tributaries and dependants (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-33.htm">Ezekiel 27:33</a>).<p>Whose merchants are princes - Princes trade with thee; and thus acknowledge their dependence on thee.

It was of course from the commercial proclivities of the Phœnicians themselves that the word acquired this secondary significance amongst the Hebrews. The petty trade of Palestine seems to have been largely in the hands of Tyrian dealers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-16.htm" title="There dwelled men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.">Nehemiah 13:16</a> ff.) and hence a Canaanite came to mean a merchant, just as a Chaldæan came to mean an astrologer and a Scotchman in some parts of England meant a pedlar.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who hath taken this counsel</span>?

The answer is given in the next verse. <span class="cmt_word">The crowning city</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the dispenser of crowns." Either to the governors of her colonies, or perhaps to the other cities of Phoenicia Proper.

Sidonian merchants, sailing over the sea, filled thee once. And the sowing of Sichor came upon great waters, the harvest of the Nile, her store; and she became gain for nations." The suffixes of &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488; (to fill with wares and riches) and &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; (the bringing in, viz., into barns and granaries) refer to the word &#1488;&#1497;, which is used here as a feminine for the name of a country, and denotes the Phoenician coast, including the insular Tyre. "Sidonian merchants" are the Phoenicians generally, as in Homer; for the "great Sidon" of antiquity (Zidon rabba&#770;h, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-8.htm">Joshua 11:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-28.htm">Joshua 19:28</a>) was the mother-city of Phoenicia, which so thoroughly stamped its name upon the whole nation, that Tyre is called &#1510;&#1491;&#1504;&#1501; &#1488;&#1501; upon Phoenician coins. The meaning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-3.htm">Isaiah 23:3</a> is not that the revenue of Tyre which accrued to it on the great unfruitful sea, was like a Nile-sowing, or an Egyptian harvest (Hitzig, Knobel). Such a simile would be a very beautiful one, but it is a very unlikely one, since the Phoenicians actually did buy up the corn-stores of Egypt, that granary of the ancient world, and housed the cargoes that were brought to them "upon great waters," i.e., on the great Mediterranean. Sichor is a Hebraic form of Siris (the native name of the upper Nile, according to Dionysius Perieg. and Pliny). It signifies the black river (Meals, Eust. on Dion. Per. 222), the black slime of which gave such fertility to the land. "The harvest of the Nile" is not so much an explanation as an amplification. The valley of the Nile was the field for sowing and reaping, and the Phoenician coast was the barn for this valuable corn; and inasmuch as corn and other articles of trade were purchased and bartered there, it thereby became gain (constr. of sachar, Ewald, 213, a, used in the same sense as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-1.htm">Isaiah 18:1-7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14</a>), i.e., the means of gain, the source of profit or provision, to whole nations, and even to many such. Others render the word "emporium;" but sa&#770;cha&#770;r cannot have this meaning. Moreover, foreigners did not come to Phoenicia, but the Phoenicians went to them (Luzzatto). </body></html>
