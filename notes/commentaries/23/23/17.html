The Lord will visit Tyre in mercy. But when set at liberty, she will use her old arts of temptation. The love of worldly wealth is spiritual idolatry; and covetousness is spiritual idolatry. This directs those that have wealth, to use it in the service of God. When we abide with God in our worldly callings, when we do all in our power to further the gospel, then our merchandise and hire are holiness to the Lord, if we look to his glory. Christians should carry on business as God's servants, and use riches as his stewards.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord will visit Tyre - He will restore her to her former wealth and magnificence.<p>And she shall turn to her hire - The word 'hire' here denotes the wages or reward that is given to an harlot; and the idea which was commenced in the previous verses is here continued - of Tyre as an harlot - frivolous, splendid, licentious, and holding intercourse with strangers and foreigners. The gains of that commerce with other nations are here represented as her hire.<p>And shall commit fornication ... - Shall again be the mart of commerce <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-3.htm">Isaiah 23:3</a>; shall have contact with all the nations, and derive her support, splendor, luxury, from all. The idea is, that she would be restored to her former commercial importance, and perhaps, also, the prophet intends to intimate that she would procure those gains by dishonest acts, and by fraudulent pretexts. After the destruction of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar, it remained desolate until the close of the Babyloian monarchy. Then a new city was built on the island, that soon rivaled the former in magnificence. That new city was besieged and taken by Alexander the Great, on his way to the conquests of the East. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. visit&#8212;not in wrath, but mercy.<p>hire&#8212;image from a harlot: her gains by commerce.

"His hand hath He stretched over the sea, thrown kingdoms into trembling; Jehovah hath given commandment concerning Kena'an, to destroy her fortresses. And He said, Thou shalt not rejoice any further, thou disgraced one, virgin daughter of Sidon! Get up to Kittim, go over; there also shalt thou not find rest." There is no ground whatever for restricting the "kingdoms" (mamla&#770;coth) to the several small Phoenician states (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-2.htm">Isaiah 19:2</a>). Jehovah, reaching over the sea, has thrown the lands of Hither Asia and Egypto-Ethiopia into a state of the most anxious excitement, and has summoned them as instruments of destruction with regard to Kenae&#772;an (&#1488;&#1500;, like &#1506;&#1500; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-5.htm">Esther 4:5</a>). Phoenicia called itself Kena&#8219;an (Canaan); but this is the only passage in the Old Testament in which the name occurs in this most restricted sense. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;, for &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-22.htm">Numbers 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-4.htm">Amos 8:4</a>. The form &#1502;&#1506;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492; is more rare, but it is not a deformity, as Knobel and others maintain. There are other examples of the same resolution of the reduplication and transposition of the letters (it stands for &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1494;&#1497;&#1492;, possibly a Phoenician word; see Hitzig, Grabschrift, p. 16, and Levi, Phoenizische Studien, p. 17), viz., &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22</a> (vid., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-7.htm">Psalm 64:7</a>), and &#1511;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-13.htm">Numbers 23:13</a>, at least according to the Jewish grammar (see, however, Ewald, 250, b).<p>(Note: Bttcher derives the form from &#1502;&#1506;&#1494;&#1503;, a supposed diminutive; see, however, Jesurun, pp. 212-216.)<p>"Virgin of the daughter of Sidon" (equivalent to "virgin daughter of Sidon," two epexegetical genitives; Ewald, 289, c) is synonymous with Kena&#8219;an. The name of the ancestral city (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-22.htm">Isaiah 37:22</a>) has here become the name of the whole nation that has sprung from it. Hitherto this nation has been untouched, like a virgin, but now it resembles one ravished and defiled. If now they flee across to Cyprus (cittiyim or cittim), there will be no rest for them even there, because the colony, emancipated from the Phoenician yoke, will only be too glad to rid herself to the unwelcome guests from the despotic mother country. </body></html>
