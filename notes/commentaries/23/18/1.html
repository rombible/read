The movements of Tirhakah, king of Cush or Ethiopia, from the upper valley of the Nile, subduing Egypt, and prepared to enter into conflict with the great Assyrian king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-9.htm" title="And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with you. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,">Isaiah 37:9</a>), had apparently excited the hopes of such of Hezekiah’s counsellors as put their trust in an arm of flesh. To these Isaiah now turns with words of warning. The words “shadowing with wings” have been very variously interpreted as implying (1) the image of a mighty eagle stretching out its imperial wings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/17-1.htm" title="And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 17:1-8</a>); (2) the <span class= "ital">urœus </span>or disk with outspread wings which appears in Egyptian paintings as the symbol of Ethiopian sovereignty; (3) the rendering <span class= "ital">resounding </span>being adopted instead of “shadowing,” the swarms of the <span class= "ital">tse-tse </span>fly that have been the terror of all travellers in Abyssinia. Of these (2) has most to commend it, and receives confirmation from the inscription of Piankhi-Mer-Amon, translated by Canon Cook in <span class= "ital">Records of the Past </span>(2 p. 89), in which that king, an Ethiopian, who had conquered Egypt, appears with the <span class= "ital">urœus </span>on his head, and the chiefs of the north and south cry out to him, “Grant us to be under thy shadow.” (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/30-2.htm" title="That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!">Isaiah 30:2-3</a>.) The phrase, “beyond the river,” points, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-10.htm" title="From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring my offering.">Zephaniah 3:10</a>, to the region of the White and the Blue Nile, south of Meroe or <span class= "ital">Sennar, </span>and not far from the Lake Nyanza of modern explorers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/isaiah/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-1.htm" title="Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia:">Isaiah 18:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Wo to the land </span>— Or, rather, as Bishop Lowth renders it, and as the particle <span class="greekheb">הוי</span>, here used, undoubtedly means, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-1.htm" title="Ho, every one that thirsts, come you to the waters, and he that has no money; come you, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.">Isaiah 55:1</a>, and elsewhere, <span class="ital">Ho! to the land. </span>The words seem evidently to contain an address to the land here meant, which is supposed to be Egypt, because of the attributes under which it is spoken of. 1st, It is said to be <span class="ital">shadowing, </span>or <span class="ital">shadowed with wings, </span>a description which, it is thought, agrees to Egypt, as connected with Ethiopia, because it is situated between two mountains on the eastern and western side of the Nile, which, as it were, overshadow it, especially where it is most narrow, toward Ethiopia, and which unfold themselves more and more in the manner of two wings, from the south toward the north. Thus Vitringa interprets the first member of the prophet’s description. But the Hebrew word, which our translators render <span class="ital">shadowing, </span>properly signifies a sort of timbrel, called in Latin <span class="ital">sistrum, </span>which was an instrument of music peculiar to the Egyptians in their sacrifices to Isis; and the two words here used, <span class="greekheb">צלצל כנפים</span>, <span class="ital">tziltzal kenaphim, </span>are interpreted by some, <span class="ital">a winged timbrel </span>or <span class="ital">cymbal, </span>which is an exact description of the Egyptian <span class="ital">sistrum, </span>and therefore is supposed to be made use of here as a distinguishing epithet of Egypt, termed <span class="ital">the land of the winged timbrel, </span>or <span class="ital">cymbal. </span>This interpretation is adopted by Bishop Lowth and many others. Both interpretations agree in this, that Egypt is the land intended; which is still more manifest from the second attribute mentioned as descriptive of it, that it is <span class="ital">beyond, </span>or rather <span class="ital">borders upon, the rivers of Ethiopia, </span>the word <span class="greekheb">מעבר</span>, signifying either on <span class="ital">this side, </span>or <span class="ital">on the </span>further side. The word <span class="greekheb">כושׁ</span>, <span class="ital">chush, </span>here rendered Ethiopia, sometimes signifies Arabia, and some interpreters think some rivers of a part of Arabia are meant, beyond which Egypt lay; but Vitringa, Bishop Lowth, and many others, understand the prophet as speaking of the Nile, and some great and celebrated rivers which flow into it from Ethiopia, and very much increase its waters. It is probable, that either the eastern branches of the lower Nile, the boundary of Egypt toward Arabia, are intended, or the parts of the upper Nile toward Ethiopia. It is thought the prophet the rather denominates Egypt from this epithet, because at this time it was under the power of the Ethiopians.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:1-7 God's care for his people; and the increase of the church. - This chapter is one of the most obscure in Scripture, though more of it probably was understood by those for whose use it was first intended, than by us now. Swift messengers are sent by water to a nation marked by Providence, and measured out, trodden under foot. God's people are trampled on; but whoever thinks to swallow them up, finds they are cast down, yet not deserted, not destroyed. All the dwellers on earth must watch the motions of the Divine Providence, and wait upon the directions of the Divine will. God gives assurance to his prophet, and by him to be given to his people. Zion is his rest for ever, and he will look after it. He will suit to their case the comforts and refreshments he provides for them; they will be acceptable, because seasonable. He will reckon with his and their enemies; and as God's people are protected at all seasons of the year, so their enemies are exposed at all seasons. A tribute of praise should be brought to God from all this. What is offered to God, must be offered in the way he has appointed; and we may expect him to meet us where he records his name. Thus shall the nations of the earth be convinced that Jehovah is the God, and Israel is his people, and shall unite in presenting spiritual sacrifices to his glory. Happy are those who take warning by his judgment on others, and hasten to join him and his people. Whatever land or people may be intended, we are here taught not to think that God takes no care of his church, and has no respect to the affairs of men, because he permits the wicked to triumph for a season. He has wise reasons for so doing, which we cannot now understand, but which will appear at the great day of his coming, when he will bring every work into judgment, and reward every man according to his works.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Woe to the land - (&#1492;&#1493;&#1497;  ho&#770;y). This word, as has been already remarked (the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12</a>), may be a mere interjection or salutation, and would be appropriately rendered by 'Ho!' Or it may be a word denouncing judgment, or wrath, as it is often used in this prophecy (the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8</a>).<p>Shadowing with wings - (&#1499;&#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; &#1510;&#1500;&#1510;&#1500;  ts&#305;&#770;letsal kena&#772;pa&#772;&#305;&#770;ym). This is one of the most difficult expressions in the whole chapter; and one to which as yet, probably, no satisfactory meaning has been applied. The Septuagint renders it, &#x39f;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  Ouai ge&#772c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  Ouai ge&#772;s ploio&#772;n pteruges - 'Ah! wings of the land of ships.' The Chaldee, 'Woe to the land in which they come in ships from a distant country, and whose sails are spread out as an eagle which flies upon its wings.' Grotius renders it, 'The land whose extreme parts are shaded by mountains.' The word rendered, 'shadowed' &#1510;&#1500;&#1510;&#1500;  ts&#305;&#770;letsal, occurs only in this place and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/41-7.htm">Job 41:7</a>, where it is translated 'fish-spears' - but as we know nothing of the "form" of those spears, that place throws no light on the meaning of the word here. The word is derived, evidently, from &#1510;&#1500;&#1500;  tsa&#772;lal, which has three significations:<p>(1) "To be shady, dark, obscure;" and hence, its derivatives are applied to anything that "makes" a shade or shadow - particularly "shady trees" <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/40-21.htm">Job 40:21-22</a>; the shades of night Sol 2:17; Sol 4:6; or anything that produces obscurity, or darkness, as a tree, a rock, a wing, etc.<p>(2) It means "to tingle," spoken of the ears <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-11.htm">1 Samuel 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-13.htm">2 Kings 21:13</a>; "to quiver," spoken of the lips <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-16.htm">Habakkuk 3:16</a>; and hence, its derivatives are applied to anything that makes a sound by "tinkling" - an instrument of music; a cymbal made of two pieces of metal that are struck together <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-42.htm">1 Chronicles 16:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-6.htm">1 Chronicles 25:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-27.htm">Nehemiah 12:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/150-5.htm">Psalm 150:5</a>)<p>(3) It means "to sink" <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-10.htm">Exodus 15:10</a>. From the sense of making "a shade," a derivative of the verb &#1510;&#1500;&#1510;&#1500;  tsela&#770;tsa&#770;l - the same as used here except the points - is applied to locusts because they appear in such swarms as to obscure the rays of the sun, and produce an extended shade, or shadow, over a land as a cloud does; or because they make a rustling with their wings.<p>The word used here, therefore, may mean either "shaded, or rustling, or rattling," in the manner of a cymbal or other tinkling instrument. It may be added, that the word may mean a "double shade," being a doubling of the word       &#1510;&#1500;  tse&#770;l, a "shade, or shdow," and it has been supposed by some to apply to Ethiopia as lying betwen the tropics, having a "double shadow;" that is, so that the shadow of objects is cast one half of the year on the north side, and the other half on the south. The word 'wings' is applied in the Scriptures to the following things, namely:<p>(1) The wing of a fowl. This is the literal, and common signification.<p>(2) The skirts, borders, or lower parts of a garment, from the resemblance to wings <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-5.htm">1 Samuel 24:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-11.htm">1 Samuel 24:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-13.htm">Zechariah 8:13</a>.

It has been proposed by some to apply this description to "ships," or the sails of vessels, as if a land was designated which was covered with "sails," or the "wings" of vessels. So the Septuagint, and the Chaldee. But there is no instance in which the word "wings" is so applied in the Scriptures.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 18<p>Isa 18:1-7.<p>Isaiah announces the overthrow of Sennacherib's hosts and desires the Ethiopian ambassadors, now in Jerusalem, to bring word of it to their own nation; and he calls on the whole world to witness the event (Isa 18:3). As Isa 17:12-14 announced the presence of the foe, so Isa 18:1-7 foretells his overthrow.<p>1. Woe&#8212;The heading in English Version, "God will destroy the Ethiopians," is a mistake arising from the wrong rendering "Woe," whereas the Hebrew does not express a threat, but is an appeal calling attention (Isa 55:1; Zec 2:6): "Ho." He is not speaking against but to the Ethiopians, calling on them to hear his prophetical announcement as to the destruction of their enemies.<p>shadowing with wings&#8212;rather, "land of the winged bark"; that is, "barks with wing-like sails, answering to vessels of bulrushes" in Isa 18:2; the word "rivers," in the parallelism, also favors it; so the Septuagint and Chaldee [Ewald]. "Land of the clanging sound of wings," that is, armies, as in Isa 8:8; the rendering "bark," or "ship," is rather dubious [Maurer]. The armies referred to are those of Tirhakah, advancing to meet the Assyrians (Isa 37:9). In English Version, "shadowing" means protecting&#8212;stretching out its wings to defend a feeble people, namely, the Hebrews [Vitringa]. The Hebrew for "wings" is the same as for the idol Cneph, which was represented in temple sculptures with wings (Ps 91:4).<p>beyond&#8212;Meroe, the island between the "rivers" Nile and Astaboras is meant, famed for its commerce, and perhaps the seat of the Ethiopian government, hence addressed here as representing the whole empire: remains of temples are still found, and the name of "Tirhakah" in the inscriptions. This island region was probably the chief part of Queen Candace's kingdom (Ac 8:27). For "beyond" others translate less literally "which borderest on."<p>Ethiopia&#8212;literally, "Cush." Horsley is probably right that the ultimate and fullest reference of the prophecy is to the restoration of the Jews in the Holy Land through the instrumentality of some distant people skilled in navigation (Isa 18:2; Isa 60:9, 10; Ps 45:15; 68:31; Zep 3:10). Phœnician voyagers coasting along would speak of all Western remote lands as "beyond" the Nile's mouths. "Cush," too, has a wide sense, being applied not only to Ethiopia, but Arabia-Deserta and Felix, and along the Persian Gulf, as far as the Tigris (Ge 2:13).God, in defence of his church and punishing her enemies, will destroy the Ethiopians, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/18-1.htm" title="Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia:...">Isaiah 18:1-6</a></span>: an access thereby shall be to the church, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-7.htm" title="In that time shall the present be brought to the LORD of hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people terrible from their beginning till now; a nation meted out and trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion.">Isaiah 18:7</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The land; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Of Arabia; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Of Ethiopia beyond Egypt; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Of Egypt, as some both ancient and later interpreters judge; of whom he speaks more darkly in this chapter, and then explains himself more clearly in the next chapter. But this controversy will be best determined by examining the following description. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shadowing with wings:</span> the title of wings is oft given, both in Scripture and in other authors, unto divers things which have, some general kind of resemblance to wings, as to the battlements of a house or temple, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-5.htm" title="Then the devil takes him up into the holy city, and sets him on a pinnacle of the temple,">Matthew 4:5</a></span>; to the skirts of a garment, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-9.htm" title="And he said, Who are you? And she answered, I am Ruth your handmaid: spread therefore your skirt over your handmaid; for you are a near kinsman.">Ruth 3:9</a></span>, and oft elsewhere; to an army, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-8.htm" title="And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.">Isaiah 8:8</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-40.htm" title="For thus said the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab.">Jeremiah 48:40</a> 49:22</span>; and to the sails of a ship, as this word is here commonly understood, and as it is unquestionably used in other authors. And <span class="ital">shadowing with wings</span> is nothing else but overspread or filled with them; which title may be given either to Ethiopia or Egypt, in regard of the great numbers, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Of their armies; or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Of their ships or vessels sailing upon the sea or rivers: for, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. In these they exceeded most of those nations who had dealings with the Jews, whereas other nations equalled or exceeded them in numerous armies. But they had an innumerable company of ships or boats, not only because of the commodiousness of the river Nilus, and its’ many branches, and the Red Sea, and the Midland Sea, for navigation; but also because of the frequent overflowings of the river Nilus over their land, which made them absolutely necessary. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. This best suits with the next verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Those ancient and venerable interpreters, the LXX. and the Chaldee, who best understood the Hebrew words and phrases, expound it so. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Beyond; </span> or, <span class="ital">on this side</span>, as this particle is rendered, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-13.htm" title="From there they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.">Numbers 21:13</a> 22:1</span>, and in many other places. Or, as others translate it, <span class="ital">besides</span>, which may comprehend both sides; and so the land of which he speaks is supposed to be situated on both sides of this river or rivers; which is most true both of Egypt and of Ethiopia. <span class="ital">The rivers</span>: a late learned writer understands this of three or four rivers of Arabia Chusaeea, whereof one flows into the Red Sea, another into the Midland Sea, and a third into a great lake; which being obscure and very inconsiderable rivers, and running in so distant channels, it is not probable that this land should receive its denomination from them. And therefore it seems more reasonable to understand this of the great river Nilus. which comes from Ethiopia, and runs through the length of that land, and through Egypt, into the Midland Sea; and which is here called <span class="ital">rivers</span>, in the plural number, as it is also <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-19.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take your rod, and stretch out your hand on the waters of Egypt, on their streams, on their rivers, and on their ponds, and on all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.">Exodus 7:19</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-18.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.">Isaiah 7:18</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm" title="Speak, and say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lies in the middle of his rivers, which has said, My river is my own, and I have made it for myself.">Ezekiel 29:3</a>,4</span>, and unquestionably Nab. iii. 8. And so it might well be called, either for its greatness, or for the many rivulets that run into it, or for the various streams or channels into which it is divided; as Tigris, upon the same reasons, hath the same title of rivers ascribed to it, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-6.htm" title="The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved.">Nahum 2:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">Of Ethiopia</span>, Heb. <span class="ital">of Cush</span>; by which he seems to understand either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Arabia, which in many places of Scripture comes under that name, though not in all places, as some learned men contend. Nor doth this place seem to be understood here, because these rivers were not interposed between Judea, in which Isaiah wrote this prophecy, and Arabia; nor were the rivers of Arabia, mentioned before, interposed between Judea and Egypt or Ethiopia: and besides, those rivers were but small and inconsiderable; and therefore, as was noted before, this land, whatsoever it is, would not have been denominated from them, especially when it is not properly situated either beyond them, or on this side of them. But if this Cush be Arabia, peradventure it were better to understand <span class="ital">the rivers</span>, or <span class="ital">the river</span>, as it was explained before, of the Red Sea, beyond which indeed both Egypt and Ethiopia were, in reference to Arabia. And whereas it may be objected that the title of <span class="ital">river</span> or <span class="ital">rivers</span> is very improperly given to the sea, it may be fairly answered, that as rivers are sometimes called by the name of the sea, as Euphrates is, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-1.htm" title="The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; so it comes from the desert, from a terrible land.">Isaiah 21:1</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-36.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD; Behold, I will plead your cause, and take vengeance for you; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry.">Jeremiah 51:36</a></span>; so this very word here rendered river is used concerning the sea in the Hebrew text, <span class="bld">Jonah 2 3</span>, and indeed may not unfitly be given to the Red Sea, which both for its length and breadth hath a manifest resemblance unto some large rivers which are in the world. And so the words may be very truly understood either of Egypt or of Ethiopia, both which countries in this sense are <span class="ital">beyond the rivers or river of Arabia</span>. But this I only propose, and submit to the reader’s judgment. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Ethiopia, properly so called; for the Cushites or Ethiopians are distinguished by Herodotus, and divers other both ancient and later writers, into the eastern, which seem to be the Arabians, and the western, which seem to be the Ethiopians under Egypt. And it is probably thought that these Cushites were first planted in Arabia, and, upon their increase, part of them passed over into Africa by crossing the Red Sea, which was; very short and an easy passage, and settled there. And according to this interpretation of the word, the description of the land given in the last clause of this verse agrees either to Ethiopia or to Egypt, as is evident from what hath been already said for the clearing of this dark and difficult verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/isaiah/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Woe to the land shadowing with wings,....

It is very difficult to determine what land is here meant: some think the land of Assyria is here designed, as Aben Ezra and others, and so it is a continuation of the prophecy concerning the destruction of the Assyrians, in the three last verses of the preceding chapter <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12</a>; the stretching out of whose wings is mentioned, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a> and thought to be referred to here; others are of opinion that the land of Judea is intended, which trusted under the shadow of the wings of Egypt and Ethiopia, to whom the characters in the next verse <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-2.htm">Isaiah 18:2</a> are supposed to belong: but the more generally received sense is, that either Egypt or Ethiopia themselves are pointed at, described as "shadowing with wings"; not with the wings of birds, as Jarchi interprets it, which flocked thither in great numbers, the country being hot, and so shaded it with their wings; but rather with mountains, with which Ethiopia, at least some part of it, was encompassed and shaded; or else with ships, whose sails are like wings, and which resorting hither, in numerous fleets of them, and hovering about their coasts and ports, seemed to shadow them; to which agrees the Septuagint version, "Woe to the land, the wings of ships!" and so the Targum, <p>"Woe to the land to which they come in ships from a far country, whose sails are stretched out, as an eagle that flies with its wings;'' <p>so Manasseh Ben Israel (c) renders them, <p>"Woe to the land, which, under the shadow of veils, falls beyond the rivers of Ethiopia.'' <p>The word translated "shadowing" is used for a cymbal, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/150-5.htm">Psalm 150:5</a> and so it is rendered here in the Vulgate Latin version, "Woe to the land, with the cymbal of wings": and some think the "sistrum", is meant, which was a musical instrument used by the Egyptians in their worship of Isis; and which had wings to it, or had transverse rods in the middle of it, which looked like wings, one of which may be seen in Pignorius (d); and so it describes the land of Egypt, famous for its winged cymbals. Minucius Felix (e) makes mention of the swallow along with the sistrum, which was a bird of Isis; and which some say was placed over the statue of Isis, with its wings stretched out. <p>Which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia; the principal of which were Astaboras and Astapus (f), and also Nile itself, which came out of Ethiopia into Egypt: or, "which is on this side of the rivers of Ethiopia" (g); and so may intend Egypt, which bordered on this side of it towards Judea; or, "which is beside the rivers of Ethiopia" (h); and so may denote Ethiopia itself, situated by these rivers. The Targum renders it, <p>"the rivers of Judea.'' <p>Some would have it, that the rivers of Arabia Chusaea are meant, which, lay between Judea and Egypt, as Besor, Rhinocorura, Trajan, and Corys; and Arabia seems rather to be meant by "Cush", than Ethiopia in Africa, since that lay beyond the rivers of Egypt, rather than Egypt beyond the rivers of Ethiopia. <p>(c) Spes Israelis, sect. 17. p. 57.

The word rendered <span class="ital">woe</span> is here neither a ‘cry of pity’ nor (as usually in Isaiah) of indignation. It is simply a particle of salutation (<span class="ital">heus</span>) as in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-1.htm" title="Ho, every one that thirsts, come you to the waters, and he that has no money; come you, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.">Isaiah 55:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/2-6.htm" title="Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, said the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, said the LORD....">Zechariah 2:6-7</a> (10, 11 Heb.). Render: <span class="bld">Ha, the land</span>, &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the land shadowing with wings</span>] a much disputed phrase. The most probable sense is that followed by R.V., <span class="bld">the land of the rustling of wings</span>. The Hebr. noun for “rustling” <span class="ital">çělâçâl</span> or <span class="ital">çilçal</span> means a kind of “locust” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-42.htm" title="All your trees and fruit of your land shall the locust consume.">Deuteronomy 28:42</a>), a “harpoon” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-7.htm" title="Can you fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?">Job 41:7</a>, A.V. “fish-spears”), and a very similar form means “cymbals” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/150-5.htm" title="Praise him on the loud cymbals: praise him on the high sounding cymbals.">Psalm 150:5</a>). The common root-idea is that of “clanging” or “jingling”; and if the above translation be correct the allusion is to the booming swarms of insects which abound in the Nile-lands. There may even be a special allusion to the dreaded Tsetse-fly, whose name among the Gallas (<span class="ital">çalçalja</span>) closely resembles the Hebr. word here used. The expression is to be understood literally, not metaphorically of armed hosts. Something might be said for the rendering of the LXX. and Targ. (“land of winged ships”) if it did not anticipate <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-2.htm" title="That sends ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes on the waters, saying, Go, you swift messengers, to a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their beginning till now; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled!">Isaiah 18:2</a></span>. Others render, “land with the shadow on both sides” (<span class="greekheb">ἀμφίσκιος</span>)—a supposed allusion to the fact that between the tropics the shadow falls sometimes on the north and sometimes on the south. But this seems very fanciful.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">beyond the rivers of Ethiopia</span>] The phrase is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-10.htm" title="From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring my offering.">Zephaniah 3:10</a>. Ethiopia (<span class="ital">Kush</span>) is used in the Bible somewhat vaguely of the region south of Syene (Assouan), at the first cataract of the Nile (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-10.htm" title="Behold, therefore I am against you, and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from the tower of Syene even to the border of Ethiopia.">Ezekiel 29:10</a>), corresponding generally to the modern Soudân (“land of the Blacks”). The empire of Tirhakah, which Isaiah has particularly in view, had its seat at Napata on the great westward bend of the Nile between Dongola and Berber. Hence it is not inappropriately described as lying “beyond” the rivers of Kush, i.e. the Nile itself and its numerous affluents (the Atbara, the Blue Nile, &c.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1–3</span>. The charge to the Ethiopian envoys, along with a poetic description of the land and people. The tendency of the ancient world to idealise the Ethiopians is familiar to students of classical literature. To the Greeks they were the “blameless Ethiopians” (Homer), “the tallest and handsomest of all men” (Herodotus). Isaiah would seem to have been struck by the fine physique of the ambassadors, and perhaps it was their narrative that furnished his vivid imagination with the picturesque details crowded into these three verses.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - THE HOMAGE OF ETHIOPIA TO JEHOVAH. Amid the general excitement caused by the advance of Assyria, Ethiopia also is stirred, and stirred to its furthest limits. The king sends messengers in beats upon the canals and rivers to summon his troops to his standard (vers. 1, 2). The earth stands agaze to see the result of the approaching collision (ver. 3); but God rests calmly in heaven while events are ripening (vers. 4, 5). When the time comes he will strike the blow - Assyria will be given to the fowls of the air and the beasts of the field (ver. 6). Then Ethiopia will make an act of homage to Jehovah by the sending of a present to Jerusalem (ver. 7). The time seems to be that immediately preceding the great invasion of Sennacherib (about  <span class="date">B.C. 700</span>), when Shabatok the Ethiopian was King of Egypt, and Tirhakah (Tahark) either Crown Prince under him, or more probably Lord Paramount of Egypt over him, and reigning at Napata. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe to the land</span>; rather, <span class="accented">Ho</span> <span class="accented">for the land!</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shadowing with wings</span>; literally, either <span class="accented">the land of the shadow of wings</span> or <span class="accented">the land of the noise of wings</span>, most probably the latter. Allusion is thought to be made to the swarms of buzzing flies, especially the tsetse, with which Ethiopia abounds. At the same time, these swarms are, perhaps, intended to be taken as emblems of the hosts of warriors which Ethiopia can send forth (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-18.htm">Isaiah 7:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Beyond the rivers of Ethiopia</span>. The prophet cannot be supposed to have had more than a vague knowledge of African geography. He seems, however, robe aware that Ethiopia is a land of many rivers (see Baker's 'Nile Tributaries'), and he assumes that the dominion of the Ethiopian kings extends even beyond these rivers to the south of them. His object is, as Mr. Cheyne says, "to emphasize the greatness of Ethiopia." It may be questioned, however, whether the dominion of the Ethiopian kings of the time extended so far as he supposed. The seat of their power was Napata, now <span class="accented">Gebel Berkal</span>, in the great bend of the Nile between lat. 18&deg; and 19&deg; N.; and its southern limit was probably Khar-toum and the line of the Blue Nile (see Rawlinson's 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 2. p. 436). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Third turn: "In that day will his fortified cities be like the ruins of the forest and of the mountain top, which they cleared before the sons of Israel: and there arises a waste place. For thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not thought of the Rock of thy stronghold, therefore thou plantedst charming plantations, and didst set them with strange vines. In the day that thou plantedst, thou didst make a fence; and with the morning dawn thou madest thy sowing to blossom: a harvest heap in the day of deep wounds and deadly sorrow of heart." The statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-3.htm">Isaiah 17:3</a>, "The fortress of Ephraim is abolished," is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-9.htm">Isaiah 17:9</a> in a more descriptive manner. The fate of the strongly fortified cities of Ephraim would be the same as that of the old Canaanitish castles, which were still to be discerned in their antiquated remains, either in the depths of forests or high up on the mountains. The word &#8219;azuba&#770;h, which the early translators quite misunderstood, signifies, both here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-12.htm">Isaiah 6:12</a>, desolate places that have gone to ruin. They also misunderstood &#1493;&#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512; &#1492;&#1505;&#1492;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;. The Septuagint renders it, by a bold conjecture, &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x391;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x395;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;; but this is at once proved to be false by the inversion of the names of the two peoples, which was very properly thought to be necessary. &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512; undoubtedly signifies the top of a tree, which is quite unsuitable here. But as even this meaning points back to &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, extollere, efferre (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-4.htm">Psalm 94:4</a>), it may also mean the mountain-top. The name ha&#770;'emori (the Amorites: those who dwell high up in the mountains) proves the possibility of this; and the prophet had this name in his mind, and was guided by it in his choice of a word. The subject of &#1506;&#1494;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; is self-evident. And the reason why only the ruins in forests and on mountains are mentioned is, that other places, which were situated on the different lines of traffic, merely changed their inhabitants when the land was taken by Israel. The reason why the fate of Ephraim's fortified castles was the same as that of the Amoritish castles, which were then lying in ruins, was that Ephraim, as stated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-10.htm">Isaiah 17:10</a>, had turned away from its true rocky stronghold, namely from Jehovah. It was a consequence of this estrangement from God, that Ephraim planted &#1504;&#1506;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1504;&#1496;&#1506;&#1497;, plantations of the nature of pleasant things, or pleasant plantations (compare on <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-49.htm">Psalm 78:49</a>, and Ewald, 287, ab), i.e., cultivated all kinds of sensual accompaniments to its worship, in accordance with its heathen propensities; and sowed, or rather (as zemo&#772;ra&#770;h is the layer of a vine) "set," this garden-ground, to which the suffix ennu refers, with strange grapes, by forming an alliance with a za&#770;r (a stranger), namely the king of Damascus. On the very day of the planting, Ephraim fenced it carefully (this is the meaning of the pilpel, sigse&#772;g from &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;  equals  &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;, not "to raise," as no such verb as &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;  equals  &#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1492;, &#1505;&#1490;&#1488;, can be shown to exist), that is to say, he ensured the perpetuity of these sensuous modes of worship as a state religion, with all the shrewdness of a Jeroboam (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-13.htm">Amos 7:13</a>). And the very next morning he had brought into blossom what he had sown: the foreign layer had shot up like a hot-house plant, i.e., the alliance had speedily grown into a hearty agreement, and had already produced one blossom at any rate, viz., the plan of a joint attack upon Judah. But this plantation, which was so flattering and promising for Israel, and which had succeeded so rapidly, and to all appearance so happily, was a harvest heap for the day of the judgment. Nearly all modern expositors have taken ne&#772;d as the third person (after the form me&#772;th, Ges. 72, Anm. 1), and render it "the harvest flees;" but the third person of &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; would be &#1504;&#1491;, like the participle in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-12.htm">Genesis 4:12</a>; whereas the meaning cumulus (a heap), which it has elsewhere as a substantive, is quite appropriate, and the statement of the prophet resembles that of the apostle in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>. The day of the judgment is called "the day of &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;" (or, according to another reading, &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;), not, however, as equivalent to nachal, a stream (Luzzatto, in giorno di fiumana), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/124-4.htm">Psalm 124:4</a> (the tone upon the last syllable proves this), nor in the sense of "in the day of possession," as Rosenmller and others suppose, since this necessarily gives to &#1504;&#1491; the former objectionable and (by the side of &#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;) improbable verbal sense; but as the feminine of nachleh, written briefly for macca&#770;h nachla&#770;h (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-17.htm">Jeremiah 14:17</a>), i.e., inasmuch as it inflicts grievous and mortal wounds. Ephraim's plantation is a harvest heap for that day (compare ka&#770;tzir, the harvest of punishment, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-11.htm">Hosea 6:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-33.htm">Jeremiah 51:33</a>); and the hope set upon this plantation is changed into &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489;, a desperate and incurable heartfelt sorrow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-15.htm">Jeremiah 30:15</a>). The organic connection between <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12-14</a>, which follow, and the oracle concerning Damascus and Israel, has also been either entirely misunderstood, or not thoroughly appreciated. The connection is the following: As the prophet sets before himself the manner in which the sin of Ephraim is punished by Asshur, as the latter sweeps over the Holy Land, the promise which already began to dawn in the second turn bursts completely through: the world-power is the instrument of punishment in the hands of Jehovah, but not for ever. </body></html>
