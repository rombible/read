Christ is Wisdom itself; in the work of our redemption there appeared the wisdom of God in a mystery. Those that saw him, said, Surely never man looked so miserable: never was sorrow like unto his sorrow. But God highly exalted him. That shall be discovered by the gospel of Christ, which could never be told in any other way. And Christ having once shed his blood for sinners, its power still continues. May all opposers see the wisdom of ceasing from their opposition, and be made partakers of the blood of sprinkling, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost; obeying him, and praising his salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/isaiah/52.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As many were astonished at thee - This verse is closely connected with the following, and they should be read together. The sense is, 'as many were shocked at him - his form was so disfigured, and his visage so marred - so he shall sprinkle many nations.' That is, the one fact would correspond with the other. The astonishment would be remarkable; the humiliation would be wonderful, and suited to attract the deepest attention; and so his success and his triumph would correspond with the depth of his humiliation and sufferings. As he had in his humiliation been subjected to the lowest condition, so that all despised him; so hereafter the highest possible reverence would be shown him. Kings and nobles would shut their mouths in his presence, and show him the profoundest veneration. A change of person here occurs which is not uncommon in the Hebrew poets. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13</a>, Yahweh speaks of the Messiah in the third person; here he changes the form of the address, and speaks of him in the second person.<p>In the following verse the mode of address is again changed, and he speaks of him again in the third person. Lowth, however, proposes to read this in the third person, 'As many were astonished at him,' on the authority of two ancient Hebrew manuscripts, and of the Syriac and Chaldee. But the authority is not sufficient to justify a change in the text, nor is it necessary. In the word rendered 'astonished' (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;  sha&#770;mmu&#770;), the primary idea is that of being struck dumb, or put to silence from sudden astonishment. Whether the astonishment is from admiration or abhorrence is to be determined by the connection. In the latter sense, it is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>. Here it evidently refers to the fact that he was disfigured, and destitute of apparent beauty and attractiveness from his abject condition and his sufferings. They were struck with amazement that one so abject, and that had so little that was attractive, should presume to lay claim to the character of the Messiah. This idea is more fully expressed in the following chapter. Here it is stated in general that his appearance was such as to excite universal astonishment, and probably to produce universal disgust. They saw no beauty or comeliness in him (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2</a>). This expression should also be regarded as standing in contrast with what is added in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-15.htm">Isaiah 52:15</a>. Here it is said they were amazed, astonished, silent, at his appearance of poverty and his humiliation; there it is said, 'kings should shut their mouths at him,' that is, they would be so deeply impressed with his majesty and glory that they would remain in perfect silence - the silence not of contempt, but of profound veneration.<p>His visage - &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;  mare'e&#772;hu&#770;. This word denotes properly sight, seeing, view; then that which is seen; then appearance, form, looks <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-17.htm">Exodus 24:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-16.htm">Ezekiel 1:16-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-18.htm">Daniel 10:18</a>. Here it means, his appearance, his looks. It does not necessarily refer to his face, but to his general appearance. It was so disfigured by distress as to retain scarcely the appearance of a man.<p>Was so marred - (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;  mishechath). This word properly means destruction. Here it means defaced, destroyed, disfigured. There was a disfiguration, or defacement of his aspect, more than that of man.<p>More than any man - (&#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;  me&#772;'iysh). This may either mean, more than any other man, or that he no longer retained the appearance of a man. It probably means the latter - that his visage was so disfigured that it was no longer the aspect of a man. Castellio renders it, Ut non jam sit homo, non sit unus de humano genere.<p>And his form - (&#1514;&#1488;&#1512;&#1493;  to'a&#774;ro&#770;). This word denotes a form or a figure of the body <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-14.htm">1 Samuel 28:14</a>. Here it denotes the figure, or the appearance, referring not to the countenance, but to the general aspect of the body.<p>More than the sons of men - So as to seem not to belong to people, or to be one of the human family. All this evidently refers to the disfiguration which arises from excessive grief and calamity. It means that he was broken down and distressed; that his great sorrows had left their marks on his frame so as to destroy the beautiful symmetry and proportions of the human form. We speak of being crushed with grief; of being borne down with pain; of being laden with sorrow. And we all know the effect of long-continued grief in marring the beauty of the human countenance, and in bowing down the frame. Deep emotion depicts itself on the face, and produces a permanent impression there. The highest beauty fades under long-continued trials, though at first it may seem to be set off to advantage. The rose leaves the cheek, the luster forsakes the eye, vigor departs from the frame, its erect form is bowed, and the countenance, once brilliant and beautiful, becomes marked with the deep furrows of care and anxiety.<p>Such seems to be the idea here. It is not indeed said that the sufferer before this had been distinguished for any extraordinary beauty - though this may not be improperly supposed - but that excessive grief had almost obliterated the traces of intelligence from the face, and destroyed the aspect of man. How well this applies to the Lord Jesus, needs not to be said. We have, indeed, no positive information in regard to his personal appearance. We are not told that he was distinguished for manliness of form, or beauty of countenance. But it is certainly no improbable supposition that when God prepared for him a body <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5</a> in which the divinity should dwell incarnate, the human form would be rendered as fit as it could be for the indwelling of the celestial inhabitant. And it is no unwarrantable supposition that perfect truth, benevolence, and purity, should depict themselves on the countenance of the Redeemer; as they will be manifested in the very aspect wherever they exist - and render him the most beautiful of human beings - for the expression of these principles and feelings in the countenance constitutes beauty (compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2</a>). Nor is it an improbable supposition, that this beauty was marred by his long-continued and inexpressibly deep sorrows, and that he was so worn down and crushed by the sufferings which he endured as scarcely to have retained the aspect of a man.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/isaiah/52.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14, 15. Summary of Messiah's history, which is set forth more in detail in the fifty-third chapter. "Just as many were astonished (accompanied with aversion, Jer 18:16; 19:8), &c.; his visage, &c.; so shall He sprinkle," &c.; Israel in this answers to its antitype Messiah, now "an astonishment and byword" (De 28:37), hereafter about to be a blessing and means of salvation to many nations (Isa 2:2, 3; Mic 5:7).<p>thee; his&#8212;Such changes of persons are common in Hebrew poetry.<p>marred&#8212;Hebrew, "disfigurement"; abstract for concrete; not only disfigured, but disfigurement itself.<p>more than man&#8212;Castalio translates, "so that it was no longer that of a man" (compare Ps 22:6).

These words are placed between the account of his exaltation and humiliation, and may be thought to have respect to both; and indeed it is astonishing that one so great as he was, and is, should become so low as he did; and also that one that was brought so low should be raised so high: <p>his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men; though fairer than the children of men, as he was the immediate workmanship of the divine Spirit, and without sin; yet, what with his griefs and sorrows he bore, and troubles he met with; what with watchings and fastings, with laborious preaching, and constant travelling about to do good; what with sweat and blood, with buffetings and scourgings, never was any man's face more marred, or his form more altered, than his was. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/isaiah/52.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">As many were astonished at thee; his visage was so <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:</span><p>(o) In the corrupt judgment of man, Christ in his person was not valued.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/52.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As many were astonied at thee.</span> The world was "astonied" to see, in One come to deliver it, no outward show of grandeur or magnificence, no special beauty or "comeliness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2</a>), but a Presence unattractive to the mass of men at all times, and in the end so cruelly marred and disfigured as to retain scarcely any resemblance to the ordinary form and face of man. The prophet, as Delitzsch says, sits at the foot of the cross on Calvary, and sees the Redeemer as he hung upon the accursed tree, after he had been buffeted, and crowned with thorns, and smitten, and scourged, and crucified, when his face was covered with bruises and with gore, and his frame and features distorted with agony. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/isaiah/52.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>How will the prophets rejoice, when they see bodily before them what they have already seen from afar!

It is assumed that the people of the captivity would still have prophets among them: in fact, the very first word in these prophecies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>) is addressed to them. They who saw the redemption from afar, and comforted the church therewith (different from mebhasse&#772;r, the evangelist of the fulfilment), lift up their voice together with rejoicing; for they see Jehovah bringing back Zion, as closely as one man is to another when he looks directly into his eyes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-14.htm">Numbers 14:14</a>). &#1489;&#1468; is the same as in the construction &#1489;&#1468; &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; has the transitive meaning reducere, restituere (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-7.htm">Psalm 14:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/126-1.htm">Psalm 126:1</a>, etc.), which is placed beyond all doubt by &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-5.htm">Psalm 85:5</a>. </body></html>
