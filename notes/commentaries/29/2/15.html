The sinner's supplication is, Spare us, good Lord. God is ready to succour his people; and he waits to be gracious. They prayed that God would spare them, and he answered them. His promises are real answers to the prayers of faith; with him saying and doing are not two things. Some understand these promises figuratively, as pointing to gospel grace, and as fulfilled in the abundant comforts treasured up for believers in the covenant of grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Before, he had, in these same words <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a>, called to repentance, because the Day of the Lord was coming, was near, "a day of darkness," etc. Now , because God is "gracious and merciful, slow to anger and plenteous in goodness," he agains exhorts, "Blow ye the trumpet;" only the call is more detailed, that every sex and age should form one band of suppliants to the mercy of God. : "Most full abolition of sins is then obtained, when one prayer and one confession issueth from the whole Church. For since the Lord promiseth to the pious agreement of two or three, that He will grant whatever is so asked, what shall be denied to a people of many thousands, fulfilling together one observance, and supplicating in harmony through One Spirit?"

Not a soul was to be absent. Like the fiery cross, it convened old and young, men and women, mothers with infants at their breasts, the bridegroom and the bride on their bridal day. All were there stretched in front of the altar. The altar itself presented the dreariest of all sights - a hearth without its sacred fire, a table spread without its sacred feast. The priestly caste, instead of gathering as usual upon its steps and its platform, were driven, as it were, to the further space; they turned their backs to the dead altar, and lay prostrate, gazing towards the Invisible Presence within the sanctuary. Instead of the hymns and music which, since the time of David, had entered into their prayers, there was nothing heard but the passionate sobs and the loud dissonant howls such as only an Eastern hierarchy could utter. Instead of the mass of white mantles which they usually presented, they were wrapt in black goat's-hair sackcloth, twisted round them, not with the brilliant sashes of the priestly attire, but with a rough girdle of the same texture, which they never unbound night or day. What they wore of their common dress was rent asunder or cast off. With bare breasts they waved their black drapery towards the temple, and shrieked aloud, 'Spare thy people, O Lord!'" Such is Dean Stanley's vivid picture of the circumstances and scene described by the prophet in the above verses. A scene exceedingly similar occurs in the commencement of the 'OEdipus Tyrannus' of Sophocles - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Why sit ye here, my children, younger brood<br />Of Cadmus famed of old, in solemn state,<br />Your bands thus wreathed with the suppliants' boughs?<br />And all the city reeks with incense,</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">And all re-echoes with your hymns and groans;<br />And I, my children, counting it unmeet<br />To hear report from others, I have come<br />Myself, whom all name OEdipus the Great."</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In these crimes the priests take the lead. Like highway robbers, they form themselves into gangs for the purpose of robbing travellers and putting them to death. &#1495;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, so written instead of &#1495;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; (Ewald, 16, b), is an irregularly formed infinitive for &#1495;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; (Ewald, 238, e).

Jerome has also rendered &#1499;&#1495;&#1499;&#1497; strangely, et quasi fauces (&#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;) virorum latronum particeps sacerdotum. Luther, on the other hand, has caught the sense quite correctly on the whole, and simply rendered it rather freely: "And the priests with their mobs are like footpads, who lie in wait for people.")<p>The company (chebher, gang) of the priests resembled such a man. They murder on the way (derekh, an adverbial accusative) to Sichem. Sichem, a place on Mount Ephraim, between Ebal and Gerizim, the present Nablus (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-7.htm">Joshua 17:7</a>), was set apart as a city of refuge and a Levitical city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-21.htm">Joshua 21:21</a>); from which the more recent commentators have inferred that priests from Sichem, using the privileges of their city to cover crimes of their own, committed acts of murder, either upon fugitives who were hurrying thither, and whom they put to death at the command of the leading men who were ill-disposed towards them (Ewald), or upon other travellers, either from avarice or simple cruelty. But, apart from the fact that the Levitical cities are here confounded with the priests' cities (for Sichem was only a Levitical city, and not a priests' city at all), this conclusion is founded upon the erroneous assumption, that the priests who were taken by Jeroboam from the people generally, had special places of abode assigned them, such as the law had assigned for the Levitical priests. The way to Sichem is mentioned as a place of murders and bloody deeds, because the road from Samaria the capital, and in fact from the northern part of the kingdom generally, to Bethel the principal place of worship belonging to the kingdom of the ten tribes, lay through this city. Pilgrims to the feasts for the most part took this road; and the priests, who were taken from the dregs of the people, appear to have lain in wait for them, either to rob, or, in case of resistance, to murder. The following &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; carries it still higher, and adds another crime to the murderous deeds. Zimma&#770;h most probably refers to an unnatural crime, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-17.htm">Leviticus 18:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-29.htm">Leviticus 19:29</a>.<p>Thus does Israel heap up abomination upon abomination. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-10.htm">Hosea 6:10</a>. "In the house of Israel I saw a horrible thing: there Ephraim practises whoredom: Israel has defiled itself." The house of Israel is the kingdom of the ten tribes. &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;, a horrible thing, signifies abominations and crimes of every kind. In the second hemistich, zenu&#772;th, i.e., spiritual and literal whoredom, is singled out as the principal sin. Ephraim is not the name of a tribe here, as Simson supposes, but is synonymous with the parallel Israel. </body></html>
