In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-13.htm" title="And the word of the LORD came to me the second time, saying, What see you? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof is toward the north.">Jeremiah 1:13</a> the symbolical caldron is represented as pouring its contents (the Chaldæan army) southwards from the face of the north. And even though the wind might be conceived as capriciously blowing the locusts from the north, yet the addition of the patronymic syllable to the Hebrew word indicates a <span class= "ital">native</span> of the north, which excludes a reference to locusts. Under the image of the destruction of the locusts, the prophet points to the deliverance from the northern invaders.<p>The east sea is the Dead Sea; the utmost or hinder sea is the Mediterranean; the desolate land is the southern desert. The northern invader shall be expelled all along the coasts of Palestine. His stink shall come up. In the eighth plague of Egypt, when on the repentance of Pharaoh the locusts were removed, they were cast into the Red Sea, and there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-19.htm" title="And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.">Exodus 10:19</a>). In the present instance there is the result stated in the case of the decomposition of the bodies of the locusts left on the land: the air was infected with a horrible pestilence. There are various allusions to this terrible result of their putrefaction in the writers who describe the horrors of a plague of locusts. St. Jerome tells of the awful sufferings inflicted on man and beast through this cause; and St. Augustine (<span class= "ital">De Civitate Dei,</span> iii. 31) relates that eight hundred thousand men perished from this reason in the kingdom of Masinissa alone, besides many more near the coast. Thus Joel declares the complete destruction of the enemies of Israel, who having completed the purpose of vengeance for which they were summoned, and, like the Assyrians under the walls of Jerusalem, having exalted themselves against the Lord, perish miserably under the stroke of His power.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joel/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:15-27 The priests and rulers are to appoint a solemn fast. The sinner's supplication is, Spare us, good Lord. God is ready to succour his people; and he waits to be gracious. They prayed that God would spare them, and he answered them. His promises are real answers to the prayers of faith; with him saying and doing are not two things. Some understand these promises figuratively, as pointing to gospel grace, and as fulfilled in the abundant comforts treasured up for believers in the covenant of grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I will remove far off from you the northern army - God speaks of the human agent under the figure of the locusts, which perish in the sea; yet so as to show at once, that He did not intend the locust itself, nor to describe the mode in which He should overthrow the human oppressor. He is not speaking of the locust itself, for the Northern is no name for the locust which infested Palestine, since it came from the south; nor would the destruction of the locust be in two opposite seas, since they are uniformly driven by the wind into the sea, upon whose waves they alight and perish, but the wind would not carry them into two opposite seas; nor would the locust perish in a "barren and desolate" land, but would fly further; nor would it be said of the locust that he was destroyed, Because he had done great things . But He represents to us, how this enemy should be driven quite out of the bounds of His people, so that he should not vex them more, but perish.<p>The imagery is from the holy land. The "East sea" is the Dead Sea, once the fertile "vale of Siddim" <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-3.htm">Genesis 14:3</a>, , "in which sea were formerly Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboim, until God overthrew them." This, in the Pentateuch, is called "the salt sea" <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-3.htm">Genesis 14:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/34-3.htm">Numbers 34:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/34-12.htm">Numbers 34:12</a>, or "the sea of the plain," or "desert" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-17.htm">Deuteronomy 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-49.htm">Deuteronomy 4:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-16.htm">Joshua 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-3.htm">Joshua 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-25.htm">Joshua 15:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-19.htm">Joshua 18:19</a>; also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>), explained in Deuteronomy and Joshua to be "the salt sea" <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3.htm">Deuteronomy 3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3.htm">Joshua 3</a>; 12; Ezekiel calls it "the East sea" <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-18.htm">Ezekiel 47:18</a>, and in Numbers it is said of it, "your south border shall be the salt sea eastward" <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-3.htm">Numbers 34:3</a>. The utmost, or rather, the "hinder sea" <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-2.htm">Deuteronomy 34:2</a> (i. e., that which is behind one who is looking toward the east whose Hebrew name is from "fronting" you) is the Mediterranean, "on whose shores are Gaza and Ascalon, Azotus and Joppa and Caesarea." The "land barren and desolate," lying between, is the desert of Arabia, the southern boundary of the holy land.<p>The picture then seems to be, that the "Northern" foes filled the whole of Judaea, in numbers like the locust, and that God drove them violently forth, all along the bounds of the holy land, into the desert, the Dead Sea, the Mediterranean. Jerome relates a mercy of God in his own time which illustrates the image; but he writes so much in the language of Holy Scripture, that perhaps he only means that the locusts were driven into the sea, not into both seas. "In our times too we have seen hosts of locusts cover Judaea, which afterward, by the mercy of the Lord, when the priests and people, 'between the porch and the altar,' i. e., between the place of the Cross and the Resurrection prayed the Lord and said, 'spare Thy people,' a wind arising, were carried headlong 'into the Eastern sea, and the utmost sea.'" Alvarez relates how, priests and people joining in litanies to God, He delivered them from an exceeding plague of locusts, which covered 24 English miles, as He delivered Egypt of old at the prayer of Moses . "When we knew of this plague being so near, most of the clerks of the place came to me, that I should tell them some remedy against it. I answered them, that I knew of no remedy except to commend themselves to God and to pray Him to drive the plague out of the land. I went to the Embassador and told him that to me it seemed good that we should make a procession with the people of the land and that it might please our Lord God to hear us; it seemed good to the Embassador; and, in the morning of the next day, we collected the people of the place and all the Clergy; and we took our altar-stone, and those of the place theirs, and our Cross and theirs, singing our litany, we went forth from the Church, all the Portuguese and the greater part of the people of the place. I said to them that they should not keep silence, but should, as we, cry aloud saying in their tongue Zio marinos, i. e., in our's, Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on us.<p>And with this cry and litany, we went through an open wheat-country for the space of one third of a league. It pleased our Lord to hear the sinners, and while we were turning to the place, because their (the locusts') road was toward the sea whence they had come, there were so many after us, that it seemed no otherwise than that they sought to break our ribs and heads with blows of stones, such were the blows they dealt us. At this time a great thunderstorm arose from toward the sea, which came in their face with rain and hail, which lasted three good hours; the river and brooks filled greatly; and when they had ceased to drive, it was matter of amazement, that the dead locusts on the bank of the great river measured two cubits high; and so for the rivulets, there was a great multitude of dead on their banks. On the next day in the morning there was not in the whole land even one live locust."<p>And his stink shall come up - The image is still from the locust. It, being such a fearful scourge of God, every individual full of activity and life repeated countlessly in the innumerable host, is, at God's will and in His time, cast by His word into the sea, and when thrown up by the waves on the shore, becomes in a few hours one undistinguishable, putrefying, heaving mass. Such does human malice and ambition and pride become, as soon as God casts aside the sinful instrument of His chastisement. Just now, a world to conquer could not satisfy it; superior to man, independent, it deems, of God. He takes away its breath, it is a putrid carcass. Such was Sennacherib's army; in the evening inspiring terror; "before the morning, he is not" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-14.htm">Isaiah 17:14</a>. "They were all dead corpses." <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>.<p>The likeness stops here. For the punishment is at an end. The wicked and the persecutors of God's people are cut off; the severance has taken place. On the one side, there is the putrefying mass; on the other, the jubilee of thanksgiving. The gulf is fixed between them. The offensive smell of the corruption ascends; as Isaiah closes his prophecy, "the carcases" of the wicked, the perpetual prey of the "worm and the fire, shall be an abhorring to all flesh." The righteous behold it, but it reaches them not, to hurt them. In actual life, the putrid exhalations at times have, among those on the sea-shore, produced a pestilence, a second visitation of God, more destructive than the first. This, however, has been but seldom. Yet what must have been the mass of decay of creatures so slight, which could produce a wide-wasting pestilence! What an image of the numbers of those who perish, and of the fetidness of sin! Augustine, in answer to the pagan who imputed all the calamities of the later Roman Empire to the displeasure of the gods, because the world had become Christian, says , "They themselves have recorded that the multitude of locusts was, even in Africa, a sort of prodigy, while it was a Roman province. They say that, after the locusts had consumed the fruits and leaves of trees, they were cast into the sea, in a vast incalculable cloud, which having died and being cast back on the shores, and the air being infected thereby, such a pestilence arose, that in the realm of Masinissa alone 800,000 men perished, and manymore in the lands on the coasts. Then at Utica, out of 30,000 men in the prime of life who were there, they assert that 10 only remained."<p>Jerome says of the locusts of Palestine ; "when the shores of both seas were filled with heaps of dead locusts which the waters had cast up, their stench and putrefaction was so noxious as to corrupt the air, so that a pestilence was produced among both beasts and men." Modern writers say , "The locusts not only produce a famine, but in districts near the sea where they had been drowned, they have occasioned a pestilence from the putrid effluvia of the immense numbers blown upon the coast or thrown up by the tides." : "We observed, in May and June, a number of these insects coming from the south directing their course to the northern shore; they darken the sky like a thick cloud, but scarcely have they quitted the shore before they who, a moment before, ravaged and ruined the country, cover the surface of the sea with their dead bodies, to the great distress of the Franks near the harbor, on account of the stench from such a number of dead insects, driven by the winds close to the very houses." : "All the full-grown insects were driven into the sea by a tempestuous northwest wind, and were afterward cast upon the beach, where, it is said, they formed a bank of 3 or 4 feet high, extending - a distance of near 50 English miles. It is asserted that when this mass became putrid and the wind was southeast the stench was sensibly felt in several parts of Sneuwberg. The column passed the houses of two of our party, who asserted that it continued without any interruption for more than a month." : "The south and east winds drive the clouds of locusts with violence into the Mediterranean, and drown them in such quantities that when their dead are cast on the shore, they infect the air to a great distance." Wonderful image of the instantaneous, ease, completeness, of the destruction of God's enemies; a mass of active life exchanged, in a moment, into a mass of death.<p>Because he hath done great things - Literally, (as in the English margin) ""because he hath magnified to do," i. e., as used of man, "hath done proudly." To do greatly <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-21.htm">Joel 2:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/126-2.htm">Psalm 126:2-3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-24.htm">1 Samuel 12:24</a>, or to magnify Himself, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-23.htm">Ezekiel 38:23</a>, when used of God, is to display His essential greatness, in goodness to His people, or in vengeance on their enemies. Man's great deeds are mostly deeds of great ambition, great violence, great pride, great iniquity; and so of him, the words "he magnified himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-15.htm">Isaiah 10:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-36.htm">Daniel 11:36-37</a>, he did greatly" <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-9.htm">Lamentations 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-8.htm">Zephaniah 2:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-4.htm">Daniel 8:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-8.htm">Daniel 8:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-11.htm">Daniel 8:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-25.htm">Daniel 8:25</a>, mean, he did ambitiously, proudly, and so offended God. In like way "great doings," when used of God, are His great works of good ; of man, his great works of evil . : "Man has great deserts, but evil." "To speak great things" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-3.htm">Psalm 12:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-11.htm">Daniel 7:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-20.htm">Daniel 7:20</a>, is to speak proud things: "greatness of heart" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-9.htm">Isaiah 9:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12</a> is pride of heart. He is speaking then of man who was God's instrument in chastening His people; since of irrational, irresponsible creatures, a term which involves moral fault, would not have been used, nor would a moral fault have been set down as the ground why God destroyed them. The destruction of Sennacherib or Holofernes have been assigned as the fulfillment of this prophecy. They were part of its fulfillment, and of the great law of God which it declares, that instruments, which He employs, and who exceed or accomplish for their own ends, the office which He assigns them, He casts away and destroys. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. the northern army&#8212;The Hebrew expresses that the north in relation to Palestine is not merely the quarter whence the invader comes, but is his native land, "the Northlander"; namely, the Assyrian or Babylonian (compare Jer 1:14, 15; Zep 2:13). The locust's native country is not the north, but the south, the deserts of Arabia, Egypt, and Libya.

The Hebrews, like other ancient nations, in fixing the points of the compass, faced Eastwards; hence <span class="ital">in front</span> or <span class="ital">before</span> is often used for the East, <span class="ital">behind</span> for the West, <span class="ital">the right hand</span> for the South (cf. the Arab. <span class="ital">Yemen</span>, i.e. the South part of Arabia). The description of the removal of the locusts is naturally not to be understood with prosaic literalness: it is intended rather as an imaginative representation of their rapid and complete destruction, though a wind rising first in the N.W., and afterwards gradually veering round to the N.E., would produce approximately the effects indicated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Rear</span> (<span class="greekheb">סוף</span>) is properly an Aramaic word (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-8.htm" title="But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying,">Daniel 4:8</a>, &c.), occurring otherwise only in late Hebrew, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-16.htm" title="To morrow go you down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and you shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel.">2 Chronicles 20:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-11.htm" title="He has made every thing beautiful in his time: also he has set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God makes from the beginning to the end.">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-2.htm" title="It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.">Ecclesiastes 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm" title="Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[<span class="ital">and his stink shall come up</span>,] <span class="bld">that</span> <span class="ital">his</span> <span class="bld">foulness may</span> <span class="ital">come up</span>] The tautology, and especially the tense and construction (<span class="greekheb">וְתַעַל</span>) of the second clause make it probable that the first clause (here bracketed) is a gloss, based upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-3.htm" title="Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of their carcasses, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.">Isaiah 34:3</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-10.htm" title="I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up to your nostrils: yet have you not returned to me, said the LORD.">Amos 4:10</a>), designed for the purpose of explaining the rare word (found only here) rendered <span class="ital">foulness</span>[43]. The reference is to the decaying carcases of the locusts, which often (see below) have been known to produce putrid exhalations.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[43] The meaning is fixed by the Aramaic (see Payne Smith, <span class="ital">Thes. Syr.</span> col. 3393–4).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">because he hath done great things</span>] lit. <span class="ital">hath shewn greatness in doing</span>. Applied to God (see the next verse), the phrase is used in a good sense; applied to His creatures, it implies that they have in some way done more than they should have done, or have acted overweeningly (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-9.htm" title="Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembers not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter.

There is of course a logical inexactness in the application of the expression to insects unconscious of moral distinctions; but the prophet invests them poetically with rational powers, just as other prophets for instance imagine trees or mountains as capable of rejoicing because Jehovah has redeemed His people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-23.htm" title="Sing, O you heavens; for the LORD has done it: shout, you lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, you mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD has redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.">Isaiah 44:23</a>, &c.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is a common fate of locust swarms to be driven away by the wind, and to perish in the sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-19.htm" title="And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.">Exodus 10:19</a>). Jerome says that in his own time when Judaea had been visited by locusts, he had known them to be driven by the wind into the same two seas which are mentioned by Joel, the shores of both being strewn afterwards by their carcases, cast up by the waters, producing pestilential odours. Augustine (<span class="ital">de Civ. Dei</span>, 3:31) quotes heathen writers as stating how in Africa immense swarms of locusts, cast by the wind into the sea, were afterwards thrown up by the waves, infecting the air, and giving rise to a serious pestilence. Locusts “not only produce a famine, but in districts near the sea where they had been drowned, they have occasioned a pestilence from the putrid effluvia of the immense numbers blown upon the coast or thrown up by the tides” (Forbes, <span class="ital">Memoirs</span>, 2:373). “The South and East winds drive the clouds of locusts with violence into the Mediterranean, and drown them in such quantities, that when their dead are cast on the shore they infect the air to a great distance” (Volney, 1:278).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea</span>. This verse promises the destruction of the devastator. The prophet here specifies the means by which the Eternal was going to restore the blessings of harvest. The order of sequence is inverted  - the effect preceding the cause; thus, re. storation of prosperity and plenty goes before, and the cause thereof, being relief from invasion and loss, follows after. Nor is there anything singular in this, as men are more alive to recovery from a distressful state of any kind than to the remedy which effects it. The "army" of this verse we still hold to be the tribes of locusts, which, like an invading army, with its numerous regimental divisions, had overrun the land, scattering dismay and distress wherever it advanced; yet from this very verse, and the expression "northern" in particular, it has been argued that it cannot refer to locusts, but to human invaders symbolized by locusts and the havoc wrought by them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The north is not the native land of locusts; it is rather the south  - the Arabian, Lybian, or Egyptian desert. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "northern" may denote the quarter from which the locusts appeared to the prophet in vision to enter the land; or, driven upward by a south wind which regularly blows, as we are informed, in those regions during spring, and then to the north of Palestine by an east wind which blows with similar regularity in summer, and again into and ultimately out of Palestine by the north wind blowing in the autumn. "In this case," says a writer in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' "the northern plague would have been a natural expression for an inhabitant of Jerusalem to use in speaking of the locusts; as natural as it would be for a Londoner to speak of a pestilence that had commenced its ravages in Great Britain at Edinburgh, as coming to him from the north, though it were originally imported from France or Spain." The word <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> may symbolically denote "calamitous," according to the explanation of some, since calamity is so frequently represented as coming from the north, so that the north is more or less identified with diasaster; thus we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a>, "I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction." It may, however, be safely admitted that, by the locust, the northern or Assyrian enemies of Judah, who advanced from the north as the most accessible quarter for attack, are in a subsidiary sense represented. The expulsion of these enemies brings relief; they are driven into a parched, and so desert and desolate, land; "and there," as Kimchi observes, "they shall die because they shall find nothing to eat." That land may be either the Idumaean desert south of Judah or Arabia Deserta. Thus the main body of the great locust-army perishes in the southern desert; while the van of the army is driven into the Dead Sea, and the rear of it into the Mediterranean Sea. Or, more literally, the face of this locust-host was towards the east, or front sea, that is, as already intimated, the Dead Sea eastward; his hinder part toward the west, or hinder sea, that is, the Mediterranean westward. Thus they were driven in every other direction than that by which they came, namely,  south, east, and west. In marking the quarters of the world, the Jews faced the east, so that the west was behind them, the south on their right hand, and the north on their left. We have thus a most vivid picture of the speedy and total destruction of the locusts. After expulsion, no danger was to be apprehended from them, for, blown into the sea or desert, they perished at once and for ever. The terms employed are very graphic; thus, <span class="accented">me'alekem</span> is much more than <span class="accented">mikkem</span> would be, and imply that a heavy burden was lifted <span class="accented">from upon</span>, or up off the face of a desolated land, and the heart of a distressed people. <span class="cmt_word">And his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great things;</span> margin, <span class="accented">magnified to do.</span> The stench emitted from the putrefying bodies of those locusts would be sickening and stifling - sufficient to occasion a pestilence. Many testimonies from travellers and others prove the reality of both circumstances - the ill savour and its pestiferous nature. Several expressions in this verse are applicable enough to an army, as in the last clause, where he is said to do great things, or literally, "magnified to do," that is, magnified himself in his doings; it may, however, apply equally well to the great destruction by the locust-army. There is no doubt the superadded notion of haughtiness along with that of great doings. It really means that, as an instrument of God, they had effected a fearfully violent desolation, and this is assigned as a reason for the total destruction of those locusts. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To this there is added the passion with which the people make themselves slave to idolatry, and their rulers give themselves up to debauchery (<a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/7-4.htm">Hosea 7:4-7</a>). <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-4.htm">Hosea 7:4</a>.
