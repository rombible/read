"For He hath given you the former rain moderately." The word rendered "moderately" should be rendered "unto righteosness;" the word often as it occurs never having any sense but that of "righteousness;" whether of God or man. The other word &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;  mo&#770;wreh, rendered "the former rain," confessedly has that meaning in the latter part of the verse, although "yoreh" &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;  yo&#770;wreh is the distinctive term for "latter rain" <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24</a>. "Moreh" mostly signifies "a teacher" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-28.htm">2 Kings 17:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-22.htm">Job 36:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-13.htm">Proverbs 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-15.htm">Isaiah 9:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-20.htm">Isaiah 30:20</a>, (twice); <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-18.htm">Habakkuk 2:18</a>), which is connected with the other ordinary meanings of the root, "torah, law, etc." The older translators then agreed in rendering, "of righteousness," or, "unto righteousness" , in which case the question as to "moreh," is only, whether it is to be taken literally of "a teacher," or figuratively of spiritual blessings, as we say, "the dew of His grace." Even a Jew paraphrases , "But ye, O children of Zion, above all other nations, be glad and rejoice in the Lord your God. For in Him ye shall have perfect joy, in the time of your captivity. "For He will give you an instructor to righteosness;" and He is the king Messias, which shall teach them the way in which they shall walk, and the doings which they shall do." The grounds for so rendering the word are:<p>(1) Such is almost its uniform meaning.<p>(2) The righteousness spoken of is most naturally understood of righteousness in man; it is a condition which is the result and object of God's gifts, not the Righteousness of God. But "He hath given you the early rain unto righteousness," i. e., that ye may be righteous, is an unaccustomed expression.<p>(3) There is a great emphasis on the word , which is not used in the later part of the verse, where rain, (whether actual, or symbolic of spiritual blessings) is spoken of.<p>(4) The following words, "and He maketh the rain to descend for you," according to the established Hebrew idiom  relates to a separate action, later, in order of time or of thought, than the former. But if the former word "moreh" signified "early rain," both would mean one and the same thing. We should not say, "He giveth you the former rain to righteousness, and then He maketh the rain, the former rain and the latter rain to descend;" nor doth the Hebrew.<p>It seems then most probable, that the prophet prefixes to all the other promises, that first all-containing promise of the Coming of Christ. Such is the custom of the prophets, to go on from past judgments and deliverances, to Him who is the center of all this cycle of God's dispensations, the Son manifest in the Flesh. He had been promised as a Teacher when that intermediate dispensation of Israel began, the prophet like unto Moses. His Coming old Jacob looked to, "I have longed for Thy salvation, O Lord." Him, well known and longed for by the righteous of old, Joel speaks of as the subject of rejoicing, as Zechariah did afterward, "Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion; behold thy King cometh unto thee." So Joel here, "Exult and joy in the Lord thy God, for He giveth," or "will give thee, the Teacher unto righteousness," i. e., the result and object of whose Coming is righteousness; or, as Daniel says, "to bring in everlasting righteousness;" and Isaiah, "By His knowledge," i. e., by the knowledge of Him, "shall My righteous Servant justify many," i. e., make many righteous. How His coming should issue in righteousness, is not here said. It is presupposed. But Joel speaks of His Coming, as a gift, "He shall give you;" as Isaiah says, "unto us a Son is given;" and that, as the Teacher, as Isaiah says, "I have given Him a witness to the peoples, a Prince and a Commander unto the people" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-4.htm">Isaiah 55:4</a>; and that, "for righteousness."<p>"It is the custom of the holy prophets," says Cyril, "on occasion of good things promised to a part or a few, to introduce what is more general or universal. And these are the things of Christ. To this then the discourse again proceeds. For when was ground given to the earth to rejoice? When did the Lord do mighty things, but when the Word, being God, became Man, that, flooding all below with the goods from above, He might be found to those who believe in Him, as a river of peace, a torrent of pleasure, as the former and latter rain, and the giver of all spiritual fruitfulness?"<p>The early rain and the latter rain - o: "He multiplies words, expresssive of the richness of the fruits of the earth, that so we may understand how wondrous is the plenteousness of spiritual goods." Being about to speak of the large gift of God the Holy Spirit as an "out-pouring," he says here that  "the largeness of the spiritual gifts thereafter should be as abundant as the riches temporal blessings" hitherto, when God disposed all things to bring about the fruitfulness which He had promised. "The early and latter rain," coming respectively at the seed-time and the harvest, represent the beginning and the completion; and so, by the analogy of earthly and spiritual sowing, growth and ripeness, they represent  preventing and perfecting grace; the inspiration of good purposes and the gift of final perseverance, which brings the just to glory consummated; "the principles of the doctrine of Christ" and "the going on unto perfection <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-1.htm">Hebrews 6:1</a>.<p>In the first month - This would belong only to the latter rain, which falls about the first month, Nisan, or our April, "the former rain" falling about 6 months earlier, at their seed time . Or, since this meaning is uncertain , it may be, "at the first" , i. e., as soon as ever it is needed, or in contrast to the more extensive gifts afterward; or, "as at first"  i. e., all shall, upon their penitence, be restored as at first. These lesser variations leave the sense of the whole the same, and all are supported by good authorities. It is still a reversal of the former sentence, that, whereas afore the rivers of water were dried up, now the rains should come, each in its season. "In the first month," and "at the beginning," express the same thought, the one with, the other without a figure.<p>For no one then needed to be told that the latter rain, if it fell, should fall "in the first month," which was its appointed season for falling. If then the words had this meaning, there must have been this emphasis in it, that God would give them good gifts punctually, instantly, at man's first and earliest needs, at the first moment when it would be good for him to have them. 'As at the beginning,' would express the same which he goes on to say, that God would bestow the same largeness of gifts as He did, before they forfeited His blessings by forsaking Him. So He says, "I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counselors as at the beginning" ; and, "She shall sing there as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she come up out of the land of Egypt" <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-15.htm">Hosea 2:15</a>; and, "then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old and as in the former years" <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-4.htm">Malachi 3:4</a>.<p>Likeness does not necessarily imply equality  as in the words, "The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet like unto me" <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>; and, "that they may be one, even as We are One" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-22.htm">John 17:22</a>. The good things of the Old Testament had a likeness to those of the New, else "the law" would not have been even the shadow of good things to come <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1</a>; they had not equality, else they would have been the very things themselves. : "Christ is the whole delight of the soul, from When and through whom there cometh to those who love Him, all fullness of good and supply of heavenly gifts, represented in "the early and latter rain," and "the full floor of wheat," and "the fats overflowing with wine and oil." It is true also as to the fullness of the mysteries. For the living water of Holy Baptism is given us as in rain; and as in grain, the Bread of Life, and as in wine the Blood." Before, "the barns were broken down," since there was nothing to store therein.<p>As other parts of the natural and spiritual husbandry correspond, and our Lord Himself compares His gracious trials of those who bear fruit, with the pruning of the vine <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-2.htm">John 15:2</a>; it may be that the "vat" wherein the grape or the olive, through pressure, yield their rich juice, is a symbol of the "tribulations," through which we "must enter the kingdom of God" <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>. : "The holy mind, placed as if in a winefat, is pressed, refined, drawn out pure. It is pressed by calamity; refined from iniquity, purified from vanity. Hence are elicited the groans of pure confession; hence, stream the tears of anxious compunction; hence flow the sighs of pleasurable devotion; hence melt the longings of sweetest love; hence are drawn the drops of purest contemplation. Wheat is the perfecting of righteousness; wine, the clearness of spiritual understanding; oil, the sweetness of a most pure conscience." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. rejoice in the Lord&#8212;not merely in the springing pastures, as the brute "beasts" which cannot raise their thoughts higher (Isa 61:10; Hab 3:18).<p>former rain &#8230; the rain &#8230; the former &#8230; the latter rain&#8212;The autumnal, or "former rain," from the middle of October to the middle of December, is put first, as Joel prophesies in summer when the locusts' invasion took place, and therefore looks to the time of early sowing in autumn, when the autumnal rain was indispensably required. Next, "the rain," generically, literally, "the showering" or "heavy rain." Next, the two species of the latter, "the former and the latter rain" (in March and April). The repetition of the "former rain" implies that He will give it not merely for the exigence of that particular season when Joel spake, but also for the future in the regular course of nature, the autumn and the spring rain; the former being put first, in the order of nature, as being required for the sowing in autumn, as the latter is required in spring for maturing the young crop. The Margin, "a teacher of righteousness," is wrong. For the same Hebrew word is translated "former rain" in the next sentence, and cannot therefore be differently translated here. Besides, Joel begins with the inferior and temporal blessings, and not till Joe 2:28 proceeds to the higher and spiritual ones, of which the former are the pledge.<p>moderately&#8212;rather, "in due measure," as much as the land requires; literally, "according to right"; neither too much nor too little, either of which extremes would hurt the crop (compare De 11:14; Pr 16:15; Jer 5:24; see on [1132]Ho 6:3). The phrase, "in due measure," in this clause is parallel to "in the first month," in the last clause (that is, "in the month when first it is needed," each rain in its proper season). Heretofore the just or right order of nature has been interrupted through your sin; now God will restore it.

Japhet says that signifies a prophet that should teach them in the way of righteousness; not Isaiah, as Grotius; but the King Messiah as Abarbinel interprets it; who is the teacher sent from God, and given by him, as his presence with him, and the miracles done by him, sufficiently prove, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>; for which he was abundantly qualified, being the omniscient God, and the Son of God that lay in the bosom of his Father; is the Wisdom of God, as Mediator; had the Spirit of wisdom on him, and the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hid in him; and who is able to make his teachings effectual, and to qualify others for such work. This office he performed personally on earth, both in a doctrinal way, and by way of example; and now executes it by his Spirit, and by his ministers: and a "teacher of righteousness" he may be truly said to be; since he not only taught the Gospel, the word of righteousness in general; but in particular directed men to seek in the first place the righteousness of God, which is no other than his own; and pronounced those happy that hungered after it: he declared he came to fulfil all righteousness, even the law for righteousness; and taught men to believe in him for it, and to live righteously and godly. Aben Ezra observes, that the phrase is the same with "the sun of righteousness", <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>; which is said of Christ the author of righteousness, who is our righteousness made so by imputation, the Lord our righteousness: or, as here, "a teacher unto, or for righteousness" (h), all which is matter of joy and gladness; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>; <p>and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month; alluding to the two seasons of the year in which rain was given to the Jews; the former rain fell in Marchesvan, which answers to our September and, October, part of each, at their seedtime; and the latter in Nisan, the first month of their ecclesiastical year, and answers to part of March and April, and fell some time before their harvest; and these former and latter rains now fall about the same time.

Others (placing the comma differently) render, “the former rain and the latter rain, <span class="ital">at the first</span>” (so R.V. marg.), or <span class="ital">first of all</span>,—in contrast namely to the spiritual gifts to be added <span class="ital">afterwards</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-1.htm" title="For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,">Joel 3:1</a>); this yields a tolerable sense, but implies <span class="greekheb">בראשונה</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-7.htm" title="The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah.">Zechariah 12:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-10.htm" title="And you shall stone him with stones, that he die; because he has sought to thrust you away from the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.">Deuteronomy 13:10</a> <span class="ital">al</span>.) for <span class="greekheb">בראשון</span>. <span class="ital">As aforetime</span> is perhaps the idea that would most naturally be expected: but this implies <span class="greekheb">כבראשונה</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-26.htm" title="And I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counsellors as at the beginning: afterward you shall be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.">Isaiah 1:26</a> <span class="ital">al</span>.)—or possibly (for it does not actually occur with that meaning) <span class="greekheb">בראשונה</span>—for <span class="greekheb">בראשון</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The ‘former rain’ and the ‘latter rain’ are not naturally epexegetical of the preceding <span class="ital">géshem</span>, which would denote rather the copious rains of winter; the repetition of the ‘former rain’ in the verse is also tautologous.

The sons of Zion are the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the capital, in which was the national sanctuary for the worship of Jehovah. Not only are the inhabitants of Jerusalem included, but, as the capital often stood for the whole country, all the inhabitants of Judah are comprehended under the "children of Zion." The ground of their gladness and joy in God is: <span class="cmt_word">For he hath given you the former rain moderately</span> (margin, <span class="accented">a teacher of righteousness</span>, or <span class="accented">for righteousness</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month</span>. Omitting for the present the disputed word <span class="accented">hammoreh</span>, we have the great blessing which was so much needed. The blessing bestowed was twofold - negative in the destruction of the locusts and deliverance from their ravages; and positive in the plentiful rainfall, <span class="accented">geshem</span>, <span class="accented">the</span> great and beneficent fertilizer of the dried-up and desolated land. But this abundant rain is more closely particularized as the early or October rain, <span class="accented">moreh</span>, which, falling at the seed-time in autumn, promoted the germination and growth of the seed just sown; and as the latter, or March rain, <span class="accented">malqosh</span>, which, bestowed in the spring season a short time before harvest, matured the crops. The <span class="accented">geshem</span>, or shower, may be regarded here as the generic name, and of these the two species are the <span class="accented">moreh</span> and <span class="accented">malqosh</span>, from <span class="accented">laqash</span>, to be ripe or late, just explained. The word <span class="accented">hammoreh</span> in the early part of the verse is translated <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "teacher" in the Chaldee and Vulgate, by Jerome, by Abar-banel among the Hebrew commentators, who refers it to Messiah; among modern commentators by Hofman, referring it to Joel himself, by Hengstenberg, who understands it of the ideal teacher or collective body of messengers from God. Keil also renders, "the teacher for righteousness," and applies the expression to the instructions of Moses, the priests, and the prophets, not excluding Messiah himself. He also understands the prophet to speak of both spiritual and material blessings, giving a fuller exposition of the latter in vers. 23-27, and of the former in vers. 28-32 and in the last chapter. The two considerations that seem to have most weight with Keil in inclining him to this exposition arc the presence of the article with <span class="accented">moreh</span>, and the non-physical sense of <span class="accented">litsdaqah</span>; hence Ewald's "rain for righteousness," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a sign from God of their being adopted again into righteousness. But weight-stones and scales have <span class="accented">tsedeq</span> attached in the physical sense of correctness, while ethical rightness is only an inference or subordinate notion (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-36.htm">Leviticus 19:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-3.htm">Psalm 23:3</a>). The translation <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> of "rain" is, we think, justly entitled to the preference from the context. Among promises of repairing the damage done by the locusts, it would be obviously out of place to introduce the notion of "a teacher." Of the Hebrew expositors, Aben Ezra and Kimchi both understand the word in the sense of rain; the former says, "In my opinion it is the same as <span class="accented">yoreh</span>;" and the latter, "<span class="accented">Hammoreh</span> is the same as <span class="accented">yoreh."</span> So also Calvin, Rosenmuller, Hitzig, and Wunsche. The etymology also is favourable to this view, for both <span class="accented">yoreh</span> and <span class="accented">moreh</span> are from the verb <span class="accented">yorah</span>, to throw (Hiph., cause to throw), throw down as drops, wet, besprinkle, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5e8;&#x5e7;</span>, and as the Qal and Hiph. sometimes coincide in meaning, we may safely conclude <span class="accented">moreh</span> synonymous with <span class="accented">yoreh</span>, the meaning of which is unquestionably "rain," specially <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. (<span class="accented">a</span>) Rain in right measure, then, we take to be the true meaning; not (<span class="accented">b</span>) rain according to righteousness, as though God, in accordance with his righteousness, repented of the evil he thought to do unto them, and, in consequence of their forsaking their sins, sent the fertilizing rains. Again, <span class="accented">barishon</span> is rendered by some (<span class="accented">a</span>) as if keba-<span class="accented">rishon</span> were equivalent to "as in the former time;" thus the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Sicuti in principio.</span> But we prefer (<span class="accented">b</span>) the rendering, "in the first month;" so the Chaldee, "In the month Nisan, or March." The Hebrew commentators explain it in like manner; thus Rashi, "In the first month - in Nisan;" Aben Ezra, "And the meaning of 'in the first' is in the first month;" Kimchi, "The explanation of the rain that is called <span class="accented">moreb</span>, he sends it down to you in its season, which is <span class="accented">Marchesvan</span> (or October), and he causes to descend to you in like manner the <span class="accented">malqosh</span> (the latter rain) in its season in the first month, which is Nisan." The blessing of the rain was thus greatly enhanced by being sent in the right measure and at the suitable season. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Both king and princes are addicted to debauchery (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-5.htm">Hosea 7:5</a>). "The day of our king" is either the king's birthday, or the day when he ascended the throne, on either of which he probably gave a feast to his nobles. &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; is taken most simply as an adverbial accus. loci. On this particular day the princes drink to such an extent, that they become ill with the heat of the wine. &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, generally to make ill, here to make one's self ill. Hitzig follows the ancient versions, in deriving it from &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;, and taking it as equivalent to &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; ot , "they begin," which gives a very insipid meaning. The difficult expression &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; &#1497;&#1491;&#1493; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1500;, "he draws his hand with the scoffers," can hardly be understood in any other way than that suggested by Gesenius (Lex.), "the king goes about with scoffers," i.e., makes himself familiar with them, so that we may compare &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1497;&#1491;&#1493; &#1506;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-1.htm">Exodus 23:1</a>). The scoffers are drunkards, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a> wine is directly called a scoffer. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/7-6.htm">Hosea 7:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/7-7.htm">Hosea 7:7</a>, the thought of the fourth verse is carried out still further. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; introduces the explanation and ground of the simile of the furnace; for <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-5.htm">Hosea 7:5</a> is subordinate to the main thought, and to be taken as a parenthetical remark. The words from &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; to &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1501; ot &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; form one sentence. &#1511;&#1512;&#1489; is construed with &#1489; loci, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-13.htm">Judges 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-10.htm">Psalm 91:10</a> : they have brought their heart near, brought them into their craftiness. "Like a furnace" (&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;) contains an abridged simile. But it is not their heart itself which is here compared to a furnace (their heart  equals  themselves), in the sense of "burning like a flaming furnace with base desires," as Gesenius supposes; for the idea of bringing a furnace into an 'o&#772;rebh would be unsuitable and unintelligible. "The furnace is rather 'orba&#770;m (their ambush), that which they have in common, that which keeps them together; whilst the fuel is libba&#770;m, their own disposition" (Hitzig). Their baker is the machinator doli, who kindles the fire in them, i.e., in actual fact, not some person or other who instigates a conspiracy, but the passion of idolatry. This sleeps through the night, i.e., it only rests till the opportunity and time have arrived for carrying out the evil thoughts of their heart, or until the evil thoughts of the heart have become ripe for execution. This time is described in harmony with the figure, as the morning, in which the furnace burns up into bright flames (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; points to the more remote tannu&#772;r as the subject). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-7.htm">Hosea 7:7</a> the figure is carried back to the literal fact. With the words, "they are all hot as a furnace," the expression in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/7-4.htm">Hosea 7:4</a>, "adulterous like a furnace," is resumed; and now the fruit of this conduct is mentioned, viz., "they devour their judges, cast down their kings." By the judges we are not to understand the sa&#770;r&#305;&#772;m of <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/7-5.htm">Hosea 7:5</a>, who are mentioned along with the king as the supreme guardians of the law; but the kings themselves are intended, as the administrators of justice, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/13-10.htm">Hosea 13:10</a>, where sho&#772;phet&#305;&#772;m is also used as synonymous with &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, and embraces both king and princes. The clause, "all their kings are fallen," adds no new feature to what precedes, and does not affirm that kings have also fallen in addition to or along with the judges; but it sums up what has been stated already, for the purpose of linking on the remark, that no one calls to the Lord concerning the fall of the kings. The suffix &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; does not refer to the fallen kings, but to the nation in its entirety, i.e., to those who have devoured their judges. The thought is this: in the passion with which all are inflamed for idolatry, and with which the princes revel with the kings, they give no such heed to the inevitable consequences of their ungodly conduct, as that any one reflects upon the fall of the kings, or perceives that Israel has forsaken the way which leads to salvation, and is plunging headlong into the abyss of destruction, so as to return to the Lord, who alone can help and save. The prophet has here the times after Jeroboam II in his mind, when Zechariah was overthrown by Shallum, Shallum by Menahem, and Menahem the son of Pekahiah by Pekah, and that in the most rapid succession (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-10.htm">2 Kings 15:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-14.htm">2 Kings 15:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-25.htm">2 Kings 15:25</a>), together with the eleven years' anarchy between Zechariah and Shallum (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-8.htm">2 Kings 15:8-12</a>). At the same time, the expression, "all their kings have fallen," shows clearly, not only that the words are not to be limited to these events, but embrace all the earlier revolutions, but also and still more clearly, that there is no foundation whatever for the widespread historical interpretation of these verses, as relating to a conspiracy against the then reigning king Zechariah, or Shallum, or Pakahiah, according to which the baker is either Menahem (Hitzig) or Pekah (Schmidt). </body></html>
