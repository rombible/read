The enemy had "done great things;" now the cause of joy is that God had "done great things;" the Almightiness of God overwhelming and sweeping over the might put forth to destroy. It is better rendered, "the Lord hath done great things." If Joel includes herein God's great doings yet to come, he speaks of them as, in the purpose of God, already in being; or he may, in this verse, presuppose that this new order of God's mercies has begun, in the destruction of the Pagan foe. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21-23.

Thus the promise is fully developed. In ver. 21 the prophet summons the earth; in ver. 22 the beasts of the field; and in ver. 23 the sons of Zion; all are called to joy and gladness on account of the great deliverance from destruction which the Lord had wrought for them. They are all called on to rejoice in the great deliverance; the land, personified, is summoned to exult and rejoice for the great things God now promises to do or is doing to it. If the locusts had done great things in destruction, God will do great things in deliverance. The beasts are also personified, and forbidden to be afraid; for whereas they had groaned and cried for want of herbage when the pastures were burnt up, those pastures are now beginning to spring, and the fruit trees yield their strength. The children of Zion are invited to rejoice, not only in the delivered land, or springing pastures, or fruitful figs, or blooming vines, or other trees however useful or ornamental; but, as became them with their superior intelligence, in the Lord their God, as the Father of mercies and the Giver of every good and perfect gift, whether temporal or spiritual. At the same time, their temporal wants would be attended to, and their land fertilized by the suitable and sustaining shower. The prophet individualizes the earth, the beasts of the field, and the sons of Zion. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the Lord will do great things.</span> The land had suffered severely from the drought connected with the locusts; but is now summoned to joy and gladness. The prophet assigns for this an appropriate reason: the locusts had done great things in damaging it; Jehovah now does great things in their destruction. When the earth clothes itself with verdure, and brings forth its fruits and flowers and various products, it is said, by a bold but beautiful personification, to rejoice and even exult. Thus the Latins said in like manner, <span class="accented">Rident arva</span>, <span class="accented">ridet ager.</span> Things are now reversed. Instead of mourning, is exultation; instead of mourning and its visible emblem in girding with sadness, there is joy and gladness; instead of the day of the Lord: very great and terrible or fearful, is "Fear not." <span class="accented">Se</span>-<span class="accented">machi</span> is fem. imper.

"The day of our king" is either the king's birthday, or the day when he ascended the throne, on either of which he probably gave a feast to his nobles. &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; is taken most simply as an adverbial accus. loci. On this particular day the princes drink to such an extent, that they become ill with the heat of the wine. &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, generally to make ill, here to make one's self ill. Hitzig follows the ancient versions, in deriving it from &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;, and taking it as equivalent to &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; ot , "they begin," which gives a very insipid meaning. The difficult expression &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; &#1497;&#1491;&#1493; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1500;, "he draws his hand with the scoffers," can hardly be understood in any other way than that suggested by Gesenius (Lex.), "the king goes about with scoffers," i.e., makes himself familiar with them, so that we may compare &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1497;&#1491;&#1493; &#1506;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-1.htm">Exodus 23:1</a>). The scoffers are drunkards, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a> wine is directly called a scoffer. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/7-6.htm">Hosea 7:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/7-7.htm">Hosea 7:7</a>, the thought of the fourth verse is carried out still further. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; introduces the explanation and ground of the simile of the furnace; for <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-5.htm">Hosea 7:5</a> is subordinate to the main thought, and to be taken as a parenthetical remark. The words from &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; to &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1501; ot &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; form one sentence. &#1511;&#1512;&#1489; is construed with &#1489; loci, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-13.htm">Judges 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-10.htm">Psalm 91:10</a> : they have brought their heart near, brought them into their craftiness. "Like a furnace" (&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;) contains an abridged simile. But it is not their heart itself which is here compared to a furnace (their heart  equals  themselves), in the sense of "burning like a flaming furnace with base desires," as Gesenius supposes; for the idea of bringing a furnace into an 'o&#772;rebh would be unsuitable and unintelligible. "The furnace is rather 'orba&#770;m (their ambush), that which they have in common, that which keeps them together; whilst the fuel is libba&#770;m, their own disposition" (Hitzig). Their baker is the machinator doli, who kindles the fire in them, i.e., in actual fact, not some person or other who instigates a conspiracy, but the passion of idolatry. This sleeps through the night, i.e., it only rests till the opportunity and time have arrived for carrying out the evil thoughts of their heart, or until the evil thoughts of the heart have become ripe for execution. This time is described in harmony with the figure, as the morning, in which the furnace burns up into bright flames (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; points to the more remote tannu&#772;r as the subject). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-7.htm">Hosea 7:7</a> the figure is carried back to the literal fact. With the words, "they are all hot as a furnace," the expression in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/7-4.htm">Hosea 7:4</a>, "adulterous like a furnace," is resumed; and now the fruit of this conduct is mentioned, viz., "they devour their judges, cast down their kings." By the judges we are not to understand the sa&#770;r&#305;&#772;m of <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/7-5.htm">Hosea 7:5</a>, who are mentioned along with the king as the supreme guardians of the law; but the kings themselves are intended, as the administrators of justice, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/13-10.htm">Hosea 13:10</a>, where sho&#772;phet&#305;&#772;m is also used as synonymous with &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, and embraces both king and princes. The clause, "all their kings are fallen," adds no new feature to what precedes, and does not affirm that kings have also fallen in addition to or along with the judges; but it sums up what has been stated already, for the purpose of linking on the remark, that no one calls to the Lord concerning the fall of the kings. The suffix &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; does not refer to the fallen kings, but to the nation in its entirety, i.e., to those who have devoured their judges. The thought is this: in the passion with which all are inflamed for idolatry, and with which the princes revel with the kings, they give no such heed to the inevitable consequences of their ungodly conduct, as that any one reflects upon the fall of the kings, or perceives that Israel has forsaken the way which leads to salvation, and is plunging headlong into the abyss of destruction, so as to return to the Lord, who alone can help and save. The prophet has here the times after Jeroboam II in his mind, when Zechariah was overthrown by Shallum, Shallum by Menahem, and Menahem the son of Pekahiah by Pekah, and that in the most rapid succession (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-10.htm">2 Kings 15:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-14.htm">2 Kings 15:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-25.htm">2 Kings 15:25</a>), together with the eleven years' anarchy between Zechariah and Shallum (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-8.htm">2 Kings 15:8-12</a>). At the same time, the expression, "all their kings have fallen," shows clearly, not only that the words are not to be limited to these events, but embrace all the earlier revolutions, but also and still more clearly, that there is no foundation whatever for the widespread historical interpretation of these verses, as relating to a conspiracy against the then reigning king Zechariah, or Shallum, or Pakahiah, according to which the baker is either Menahem (Hitzig) or Pekah (Schmidt). </body></html>
