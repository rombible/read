There is no escaping God's judgments; hardened sinners, in that day of wrath, shall be cut off from all comfort and joy. Most of the prophets foretell the same final victory of the church of God over all that oppose it. To the wicked it will be a terrible day, but to the righteous it will be a joyful day. What cause have those who possess an interest in Christ, to glory in their Strength and their Redeemer! The acceptable year of the Lord, a day of such great favour to some, will be a day of remarkable vengeance to others: let every one that is out of Christ awake, and flee from the wrath to come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let the pagan be awakened - This emphatic repetition of the word, "awaken," seems intended to hint at the great awakening, to Judgment , when they "who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, being awakened" from the sleep of death. Another word is used of "awakening" . On the destruction of antichrist it is thought that the general Judgment will follow, and "all who are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of Man and shall come forth" <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-27.htm">John 5:27-29</a> : They are bidden to "come up" into the valley of Jehoshaphat , "for to come into the presence of the most High God, may well be called "a coming up." For there will I sit to judge all the pagan round about," (again literally "from round about,) from every side," all nations from all the four quarters of the world. The words are the same as before. There "all nations from every side" were summoned to come, as they thought, to destroy God's people and heritage. Here the real end is assigned, for which they were brought together, for God would sit to judge them. In their own blind will and passion they came to destroy; in God's secret overruling Providence, they were dragged along by their passions - to be judged and to be destroyed. So our Lord says, "When the Son of Man shall come in His Glory, and all the Holy Angels with Him, then shall He sit on the throne of His Glory and before Him shall be gathered all nations" <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-32</a>. Our Lord, in that He uses words of Joel, seems to intend to direct our minds to the prophet's meaning.

"For Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning, the altars have become to him for sinning. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-12.htm">Hosea 8:12</a>. I wrote to him the fulnesses of my law; they were counted as a strange thing." Israel was to have only one altar, and that in the place where the Lord would reveal His name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>.). But instead of that, Ephraim had built a number of altars in different places, to multiply the sin of idolatry, and thereby heap more and more guilt upon itself. &#1500;&#1495;&#1496;&#1488; is used, in the first clause, for the act of sin; and in the second, for the consequences of that act. And this was not done from ignorance of the divine will, but from neglect of the divine commandments. &#1488;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; is a historical present, indicating that what had occurred was continuing still. These words refer unquestionably to the great number of the laws written in the Mosaic thorah. &#1512;&#1489;&#1493;, according to the chethib &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;, with &#1514; dropped, equivalent to &#1512;&#1489;&#1489;&#1492;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-7.htm">1 Chronicles 29:7</a>, ten thousand, myriads. The Masoretes, who supposed the number to be used in an arithmetical sense, altered it, as conjecturally unsuitable, into &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;, multitudes, although &#1512;&#1489; does not occur anywhere else in the plural. The expression "the myriads of my law" is hyperbolical, to indicate the almost innumerable multitude of the different commandments contained in the law. It was also in a misapprehension of the nature of the hyperbole that the supposition originated, that &#1488;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; was a hypothetical future (Jerome). &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493; &#1494;&#1512;, like something foreign, which does not concern them at all. </body></html>
