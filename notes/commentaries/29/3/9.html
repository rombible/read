In these words the prophet, in an ironical manner, encourages them to make their utmost effort to oppose the designs of Providence; but signifies that it should be all in vain. For, should they strengthen themselves by all the means in their power, yet they should be overcome and punished. <span class="ital">Beat your plough-shares into swords, </span>&c. — That is, make all the provision and preparation for war, or for your own defence, that you possibly can.

There is no escaping God's judgments; hardened sinners, in that day of wrath, shall be cut off from all comfort and joy. Most of the prophets foretell the same final victory of the church of God over all that oppose it. To the wicked it will be a terrible day, but to the righteous it will be a joyful day. What cause have those who possess an interest in Christ, to glory in their Strength and their Redeemer! The acceptable year of the Lord, a day of such great favour to some, will be a day of remarkable vengeance to others: let every one that is out of Christ awake, and flee from the wrath to come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles - God having before said that He would "gather all nations," now, by a solemn irony, bids them prepare, if, by any means, they can fight against Him. So in Isaiah; "Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand, for God is with us" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-9.htm">Isaiah 8:9-10</a>; see also <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-7.htm">Ezekiel 38:7-23</a>).<p>Prepare - Literally, "hallow, war." To "hallow war" was to make it holy, either in appearance or in truth, as the prophet bade them, "sanctify a fast," i. e., keep it holily. So God calls the Medes, whom He employed against Babylon, "My sanctified ones" <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>, and bids, "sanctify the nations against her" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27</a>; and the enemies of Judah encourage themselves, "sanctify ye war against her" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-4.htm">Jeremiah 6:4</a>; and Micah says, that whosover bribed not the false prophets, "they sanctify war against him" <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>, i. e., proclaim war against him in the Name of God. The enemies of God, of His people, of His truth, declare war against all, in the Name of God. The Jews would have stoned our Lord for blasphemy, and, at the last, they condemned Him as guilty of it. "He hath spoken blasphemy. What further need have we of witttesses? behold, now ye have heard His blasphemy" <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-65.htm">Matthew 26:65</a>. And He foretold to His disciples, "Whosoever killeth you, will think he doeth God service" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-2.htm">John 16:2</a>.<p>Stephen was persecuted for speaking "blasphemous words against Moses and against God, this holy place and the law" <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-11.htm">Acts 6:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-13.htm">Acts 6:13</a>. Paul was persecuted for "persuading people to worship God contrary to the law and polluting this holy place" <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-13.htm">Acts 18:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-28.htm">Acts 21:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-6.htm">Acts 24:6</a>. Antichrist shall set himself up as God, "so that he, as God, sitteth in the temple of God shewing himself that he is God" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>. Heretics and unbelievers declaim against the Gospel, as though it, and not themselves, were opposed to the holiness and Majesty and love of God. The Gnostics of old spake against the Creator in the Name of God. Arians affected reverence for the glory of God , being, on their own mis-belief, idolaters or polytheists . The Apollinarians charged the Church with ascribing to our Lord a sinful soul, as though the soul must needs be such , find themselves held the Godhead to have been united to a soulless, and so a brute, nature.<p>Manichaeans accused her of making God the author of evil, and themselves, as do Pantheists now, invented a god who sinned . Novatians and Donatists accused the Church of laxity. Pelagians charged her with denying the perfectibility of man's nature, themselves denying the grace whereby it is perfected. Muhammed arrayed the truth of the Unity of God against His Being in Three Persons, and fought against the truth as idolatry. Some now array "Theism," i. e., truths as to God which they have stolen from Holy Scripture, against the belief in God as He has revealed Himself. Indeed, no imposture ever long held its ground against truth, unless it masked itself under some truth of God which it perverted, and so "hallowed" its "war" against God in the Name of God.<p>Wake up the mighty men - Arouse them, as if their former state had been a state of sleep; arouse all their dormant powers, all within them, that they may put forth all their strength, if so be they may prevail against God.<p>Let all the men of war draw near - , as if to contend, and close, as it were, with God and His people (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-41.htm">1 Samuel 17:41</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-13.htm">2 Samuel 10:13</a>), as, on the other hand, God says, "I will come near to you to judgment" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-1.htm">Isaiah 41:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-8.htm">Isaiah 50:8</a>). "Let them come up" into His very presence. Even while calling them to fulfill this their vain purpose of striving with God, the prophet keeps in mind, into whose presence they are summoned, and so calls them to "come up," as to a place of dignity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joel/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. The nations hostile to Israel are summoned by Jehovah to "come up" (this phrase is used because Jerusalem was on a hill) against Jerusalem, not that they may destroy it, but to be destroyed by the Lord (Eze 38:7-23; Zec 12:2-9; 14:2, 3).<p>Prepare war&#8212;literally, sanctify war: because the heathen always began war with religious ceremonies. The very phrase used of Babylon's preparations against Jerusalem (Jer 6:4) is now used of the final foes of Jerusalem. As Babylon was then desired by God to advance against her for her destruction, so now all her foes, of whom Babylon was the type, are desired to advance against her for their own destruction.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joel/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Proclaim; </span> publish, or make known, as by sound of trumpet: some say it is an irony; I rather think it is a declaration of what is to come to pass through some ages before the coming of the Messiah, as will appear probable from what followeth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">This; </span> or these things, which I am purposed to do in retaliating to the enemies of my people; proclaim wars which may make captives for sale under the hand of my people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Among the Gentiles; </span> the Assyrians, Chaldeans, Babylonians, and Grecians successively.

Certain formalities of a religious nature were customary among the heathen when war was proclaimed and prepared for. Thus also among the Jews supplication was made and sacrifices offered, as we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-8.htm">1 Samuel 7:8, 9</a>, that before the battle with the Philistines at Mizpeh, the people urged Samuel to make earnest supplication and sacrifice for them, when in compliance he "took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the Lord: and Samuel cried unto the Lord for Israel;" and thus a preparation for war was a consecration of war by religious rites. <span class="cmt_word">Wake up the mighty men</span>; or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> according to Keil, <span class="accented">waken up</span> or <span class="accented">arouse the mighty men.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> A preferable rendering, according to Wunsche, is, "Wake up, ye mighty men;" while he understands the whole address as directed to the covenant people.

In either case, the heroes may be conceived as enjoying peaceful repose when they are rudely roused by the declaration of war; and as the word "war" is indefinite through the absence of the  article, it implies, "What a war! how great and terrible!" <span class="cmt_word">Let all the men of war drew near; let them come up</span>. The terms here used are technical military terms, summoning the warriors to advance and march onward in haste to the place of conflict. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"For they went up to Asshur; wild ass goes alone by itself; Ephraim sued for loves. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-10.htm">Hosea 8:10</a>. Yea, though they sue among the nations, now will I gather them, and they will begin to diminish on account of the burden of the king of the princes." Going to Assyria is defined still further in the third clause as suing for loves, i.e., for the favour and help of the Assyrians. The folly of this suing is shown in the clause, "wild ass goes by itself alone," the meaning and object of which have been quite mistaken by those who supply a &#1499; simil. For neither by connecting it with the preceding words thus, "Israel went to Asshur, like a stubborn ass going by itself" (Ewald), nor by attaching to it those which follow, "like a wild ass going alone, Ephraim sued for loves," do we get any suitable point of comparison. The thought is rather this: whilst even a wild ass, that stupid animal, keeps by itself to maintain its independence, Ephraim tries to form unnatural alliances with the nations of the world, that is to say, alliances that are quite incompatible with its vocation. Hithna&#770;h, from ta&#770;na&#770;h, probably a denom. of 'ethna&#770;h (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-14.htm">Hosea 2:14</a>), to give the reward of prostitution, here in the sense of bargaining for amours, or endeavouring to secure them by presents. The kal yithnu&#772; has the same meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-10.htm">Hosea 8:10</a>. The word &#1488;&#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1501;, to which different renderings have been given, can only have a threatening or punitive sense here; and the suffix cannot refer to &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, but only to the subject contained in yithnu, viz., the Ephraimites. The Lord will bring them together, sc. among the nations, i.e., bring them all thither. &#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1509; is used in a similar sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-6.htm">Hosea 9:6</a>.
